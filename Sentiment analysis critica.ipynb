      "It's not about poverty pornography. It's not about a White guy showing us touchy Brown-skins squatting by the rail-tracks. In the end, it's just about a film, which sweeps you up and takes you for an exhilarating ride on the wild side. 0.26666666666666666\n",
      "Slumdog Millionaire is an exhilarating ride -- a feel-good yarn about a Mumbai street kid directed by Danny Boyle with a wild energy that makes even Trainspotting (Boyle's calling card) look leaden-footed. 0.2333333333333333\n",
      "There are so many frantic pursuits through heaving streets that it is easy to lose track of who is chasing whom, or why. Energy and urgency are substituted for realism. 0.4666666666666667\n",
      "Slumdog is a good film and an appealing film with some lovely performances but it's not a great film: it's too sentimental and predictable for that. 0.14166666666666664\n",
      "Boyle set out to make this particular film rather than a gritty social panorama along the lines of Brazilian favela drama City of God. But keeping us cheerful takes the edge off the tougher insights into India. 0.15\n",
      "Boyle takes his wildly high-energy visual aesthetic and applies it to a story that, at its core, is rather sweet and traditionally crowdpleasing. 0.11249999999999999\n",

      "Mumbai's brand new skyscrapers sprout out of patches of mud; Jamal's old-fashioned principles will forever be out of synch with the slick, nightclub world that his older brother Salim inhabits. And so it goes. The romance? Fear not. It's fabulous icing. 0.11325757575757575\n",
      "Despite being overpraised - it arrives garlanded with the kind of reviews that must have come out after the opening night of King Lear - this is still very effective entertainment. 0.69\n",
      "Slumdog Millionaire is as acerbic as it is clear-eyed about the brutal power dynamics in modern-day Mumbai. But, at the same time, what makes it so warming and what has been inspiring audiences all across the world to cheer at its rousing ending. -0.125\n",
      "Danny Boyle's finest since Trainspotting. In fact, it's the best British/Indian gameshow-based romance of the millennium. 1.0\n",
      "Don't worry about suspending disbelief: for an hour or so Boyle will do it for you. The film's visual panache is strong enough to ambush doubters, whose scepticism will stumble into hidden nets and be hoisted high into the firmament. 0.06277777777777778\n",
      "I'm not sure it's a great movie, but it's certainly a great audience movie. 0.45\n",

      "Slumdog Millionaire is not the cure for all the world's ills, but it comes close. It solves, for instance, such endemic global problems as: a) sadness, b) lovelessness, c) cynicism, and d) the waning cultural relevance of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. 0.07500000000000001\n",

      "The film is a delight. 0.0\n",
      "Not that the movie from director Danny Boyle isn't satisfying, isn't more than worth seeing. But I had been expecting cinematic fireworks to justify the claim that it's the best movie of the new millennium. 0.406060606060606\n",

      "It's fair to say that the movie ends so well that it will redeem the entire experience for many viewers. It all depends on how you feel about the sluggish 90 minutes that went before. 0.39999999999999997\n",

      "Slumdog Millionaire is nothing if not an enjoyably far-fetched piece of rags-to-riches wish fulfillment. It's like the Bollywood version of a Capra fable sprayed with colorful drops of dark-side-of-the-Third-World squalor. 0.4\n",

      "Slumdog Millionaire has the goods to bust out as a scrappy contender in the Oscar race. It's modern India standing in for a world in full economic spin. 0.25\n",
      "Slumdog Millionaire is a ruthlessly effective paean to destiny, leaving nothing to chance. It also has a good shot at winning this year's Academy Award for best picture, if the pundits, Allah, Shiva and Fox Searchlight Pictures have anything to say 0.7\n",
      "A gaudy, gorgeous rush of color, sound and motion, Slumdog Millionaire doesn't travel through the lower depths, it giddily bounces from one horror to the next. 0.3666666666666667\n",

      "Slumdog Millionaire is fantasy yet its hyperactively effervescent (if still personal, intimate) portrait of both ingrained social barriers and altruism's ability to demolish them is genuine and sweet. 0.19666666666666666\n",
      "Despite its elements of brutality, this is a buoyant hymn to life, and a movie to celebrate. 0.0\n",

      "A perfect blend of sweetness and mordancy. 1.0\n",
      "Though lighter than Arrows 2018 release on the extras front, Kinos 4K of The Apartment provides the definitive home-video presentation of one of Billy Wilders greatest films. 1.0\n",
      "This is a polished production, naughty, ironic, occasionally poignantly sad, and as sparkling as a Fourth of July fireworks display. -0.1125\n",
      "[Jack Lemmon] is a genuine actor, not in the same universe with most of his film contemporaries, who are mere behavers. This picture is not good enough for him. Still, his performance makes it worth a visit. 0.05\n",
      "Director Wilder has come up with another real winner in The Apartment... It is a film with plenty of fun and one that promises hope in a society whose moral standards seems to be rapidly deteriorating 0.16666666666666666\n",
      "Anybody complaining that modern Hollywood comedy doesn't have the old human touch, the heart once supplied by directors like Frank Capra and Gregory LaCava, ought to see this. It is one of the best films of the year. 0.325\n",
      "Billy Wilder, who gave us Some Like It Hot with Lemmon and quite a dash of wry humor, turns over his entire screenplay to master wit Lemmon in this latest one. 0.25\n",
      "It doesn't fit easily into any simple classification. For the script Wilder wrote in collaboration with I. A. L. Diamond -- and with Lemmon's talent in mind -- is an expert, winning blend of comedy and pathos. 0.33333333333333337\n",
      "Lemmon's comic versatility is well exercised before the plot takes a sudden serious turn. The transition is a little startling, until Lemmon and MacLaine warm up to the switch and produce a human, believable, and some-what message-loaded finish. 0.04114583333333334\n",
      "You can take your choice of adjectives to describe The Apartment.. Here is a partial list: Ironic, satirical, funny, sentimental, bitter and sad. -0.08333333333333333\n",
      "Disguised as a comedy [and frequently very funny] this film struck me as a biting, skillful satire and a ribald portrait of some organization men. 0.325\n",
      "The dialogue of Wilder an d I. A. L. Diamond is sharp and witty, and the characterisation amusing down to the smallest role, thanks to disciplined direction of players who are all professional to their fingertips. 0.1865740740740741\n",
      "It is a masterpiece of fun and irony about the small men who make up American big business. 0.012499999999999997\n",
      "However funny Mr Lemmon may be this really is not a funny situation. 0.0625\n",
      "Miss MacLaine, who has a metaphorical tightrope to walk, shows throughout that she is in no need of a safety net. Here again emotion finds itself expressed through comedy. 0.0\n",
      "\"Some people take, and some people get took,\" Bud says, and The Apartment never wavers in condemning the former and aligning itself with the latter. 0.0\n",
      "While the mordant ruthlessness of the asides at the expense of big business intrigues, indiscretions and Christmas parties is compromised by a final sequence of quite awful sentimentality. -0.3333333333333333\n",
      "All this is quite a load for a comedy, but where else has social comment ever been so effective? Wilder hones his points to a piercing edge... 0.31666666666666665\n",
      "Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be. 0.41\n",
      "...despite all its cynicism, The Apartment still ends on a hopeful note... 0.0\n",
      "Wilder, a bilious and mercurial wit, here becomes a wide-screen master of time ... 0.0\n",
      "Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine shine as two essentially good souls trapped in a tangle of office politics. 0.24999999999999997\n",
      "Wilder has made some truly great movies, but this one is not the masterpiece we thought it was. 0.8\n",
      "Directed by Wilder with attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, it's lifted considerably by the performances. 0.05\n",
      "A comedy of men's-room humours and water-cooler politics that now and then among the belly laughs says something serious and sad about the struggle for success, about what it often does to a man, and about the horribly small world of big business. -0.15666666666666665\n",
      "Not to be missed on any account. 0.0\n",
      "Most of the time, it's up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-plus film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing. 0.5333333333333333\n",
      "I wouldn't call this 1960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies -- it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 125 minutes. 1.0\n",
      "In the canon of classics by famed writer/director Billy Wilder, this jewel of a comedy easily stands as one of his most beloved. 0.5444444444444444\n",
      "This essential Billy Wilder film smoothly combines trenchant social observation with hilarious comedy. 0.23333333333333334\n",
      "Elevates the workplace romance into a sublime erotics of officious addresses (the omnipresent Mister and Miss) and economic conundrum. 0.2\n",
      "This comedy tells truths about American business and sexual mores as uncomfortable now as they were in 1960. 0.0\n",
      "There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason. 0.0\n",
      "Wilder and IAL Diamond's brilliantly witty screenplay has a serious undertow as it savages corporate ethics and conjugal infidelity. 0.05555555555555556\n",
      "A gleeful, tender and even sentimental film. -0.25\n",
      "Driving Miss Daisy retains its coziness and its slightness, but it has been filmed eloquently. 0.0\n",
      "Mild but pleasing... The movie, passing in time from the fifties through the civil-rights period, lovingly measures the precise shadings of irritation, affection, and dependence that flow back and forth between two characters. 0.33333333333333337\n",
      "Is this supposed to represent an achievement of dignity and freedom?... What I saw was an improbable saintlike character persecuted by a cranky, bigoted tyrant who became slightly less cranky but never less condescending with time. -0.041666666666666664\n",
      "The delicate balance between the placid human drama and the convulsion of change is maintained by Uhry's script and Bruce Beresford's masterful direction. How refreshing to see a film without quick cuts and visual shock. 0.1761904761904762\n",
      "Aykroyd's performance is not one of those that makes a viewer want to rush home and be nicer to his aged mother; it's better than that. 0.2\n",
      "It is as frank an examination of a troubled American heartland as another masterful picture of late 1989, Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July, but significantly sweeter, sadder, and more good-humored. 0.15357142857142855\n",
      "For all its pleasing moments of humour, the film seems to be held in the clutches of a rather questionable nostalgia. When near the end the matron confides to the chauffeur that he is the nearest thing she has to a friend, we cannot quite believe her. -0.2\n",
      "What Driving Miss Daisy is really nostalgic for is not the plump rump of a 1948 Packard, or the graciousness of Atlanta streets in the old days, but for a time when black servants died quietly while shelling peas without bothering their masters. -0.14166666666666666\n",
      "Though its intentions are impeccable, there is a feeling of “Amos ’n’ Tandy” about this two-hander that isn’t pushed upfront, but does remind you that the story only works in a society where the blacks are still content to know their place. 0.375\n",
      "Driving Miss Daisy has made the trip from stage to screen with its virtues intact. It still has the quiet courage to present human beings in all their blindness and foolishness, and persuade us to care for them anyway. 0.0\n",
      "Tandy and Freeman make the most of it, and in the process save a piece that negotiates the journey from stage to screen with some moments of uncertainty. 0.5\n",
      "The slow growth to friendship is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in a movie. 0.3499999999999999\n",
      "Tandy and Freeman give performances of splendid depth and restraint that are matched by Beresford's admirably light directorial touch and the sumptuous cinematography of Australian Peter James. 0.41111111111111115\n",
      "Uhry's screen play is sharp, funny, unsentimental, and the performances deserve every prize they can get... It is a film of unimpaired delight. 0.0625\n",
      "This is a chamber movie with the courage to stay small and resonant. -0.25\n",
      "Freeman is note-perfect with Hoke's dignified warmth, and Tandy, whose every moment on screen is an acting lesson, turns in what by far is the most hauntingly elegant performance of the year. 0.275\n",
      "Every one of these dramatic maelstroms manages to appear fresh because Freeman and Tandy somehow manage to come up with new approaches, meting out complementary aspects of their characters. 0.0010101010101010166\n",
      "Fine acting, subtle direction, good writing, in fact, a film for everyone to appreciate and enjoy. 0.23666666666666666\n",
      "The movie never resorts to sentimentality. It has a dry wit as well as genuine warmth. Best of all it is the perfect showcase for two deserving actors -- Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. 0.5866666666666667\n",
      "One of the year's best films, a rarity in that a play has been successfully transferred to film without having the dialogue seem \"written.\" 0.875\n",
      "Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give exceptional performances. 0.6666666666666666\n",
      "Freeman and Tandy have their own performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion. 0.39999999999999997\n",
      "This is a story about people, not politics. And perhaps because we can see the actors in closeup on the screen, that is even truer of the movie than the play. 0.0\n",
      "For Tandy, it's her most substantial film role since her sublime work in Alfred Hitchcock`s 1963 The Birds, and she takes full advantage of it; never playing for sympathy, she earns it completely. 0.31666666666666665\n",
      "Alfred Uhry's adaptation of his Pulitzer-prizewinning play aspires more to complex observation of human behavior than to simple moralism about it. Precisely because it has its priorities straight, it succeeds superbly on both levels. 0.3125\n",
      "It gets to its hugely emotional destination without ever having to put the foot down; a poignant and provocative road movie. -0.051851851851851864\n",
      "Bruce Beresford's sensitive direction complements Alfred Uhry's skillful adapation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. 0.1\n",
      "The movie also has something legitimate and instructive to say about the subtlety and intricacy of everyday race relations in the south during the period covered (roughly 1948 to '73). -0.15000000000000002\n",
      "Far too cosy to serve as an effective social or political metaphor; better to regard it as a solid ensemble piece. 0.20555555555555557\n",
      "There is an exhilarating, singularly theatrical lightness of touch that is often lost when these settings are made manifest in a movie. 0.35\n",
      "This is Tandy's finest two hours onscreen in a film career that goes back to 1932. 0.0\n",
      "The story holds a potential for sap that is mostly unfulfilled thanks to Beresford's stately approach, the stars' better judgment and the protagonists' sharp wits. 0.215\n",
      "The movie gets you mainly because Morgan Freeman, who played chauffeur Hoke Colburn in the original stage production (and won his third Obie for it), takes the wheel and drives Daisy all the way home. 0.18055555555555555\n",
      "Driving Miss Daisy is a film of great love and patience, telling a story that takes 25 years to unfold, exploring its characters as few films take the time to do. 0.3666666666666667\n",
      "Coda is a Mort (‘Middle Of Road Tearjerker’) and if that’s what you like, you will like this. 0.0\n",
      "The sense of calculation makes the journey feel like a lockstep march; the movie’s sense of a story that’s dictated rather than observed makes its good feelings feel bad. 5.551115123125783e-17\n",
      "No theatrics, no gimmicks - just a wonderful coming-of-age gem that aims directly at the heart and hits the bullseye. 0.55\n",
      "If there's a flaw to \"CODA\" - the title stems from the term \"child of deaf adult\" -- it may be that it wears its brimming heart on its sleeve to such an extent that it occasionally nears that fine line into formula. 0.12916666666666668\n",
      "A coming-of-age story meant to move. And while the beats of the film may be predictable, it's no less affecting. -0.05833333333333334\n",
      "Ruby is an underdog worth rooting for, and Jones is terrific. She's like a cross between the young Winona Ryder and the young Kate Winslet. The comparison flatters all three. 0.1\n",
      "You'll laugh, cry and all steps in between at this vital family entertainment with a title that stands for Children of Deaf Adults. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and newcomer Emilia Jones turn this emotional powerhouse into one of the year's best. 0.35\n",
      "Heder, who spent time on the Massachusetts coast when growing up, knows exactly how a narrative can be enriched by the colours, moods and customs of its setting. You get to know the Rossis very well, and they're great company. 0.2875\n",
      "Each performance breathes life and nuance into what could easily have been a misfire. Instead, the result is tremendously sweet, uproariously funny and one of the best crowd-pleasers this year. 0.36666666666666664\n",
      "The film is a meticulously, perhaps even cynically crafted crowd-pleaser. Even those alive to its tactics might find themselves wiping away a tear or two. -0.25\n",
      "As effective as it is -- and it is an effective tearjerker -- it does go down the checklist of things to push your buttons on. It's almost like a really well-designed Broadway show. 0.31111111111111106\n",
      "You will cry in the best possible ways, even though you know better. It's kind of formulaic, but it's just so warm and true. 0.4357142857142858\n",
      "This is a familiar kind of story, but it sidesteps the clichés and the formula to be something quite moving... This is a \"feel good movie\" in the best sense. 0.66875\n",
      "As with so much in CODA, it's simple - but so beautifully executed. 0.35000000000000003\n",
      "The conflict is unique, but the dynamic is universal... 0.125\n",
      "Ruby is a gifted singer...a feel-good coming-of-age comedy... 0.5\n",
      "Coda is a small movie, exquisitely made. Touching, funny and stirring, it would be the kind of movie you'd urge a friend to run out and see, except they'll only need to stay home and ante up to stream it on Apple TV+. 0.35000000000000003\n",
      "The knock here isn't that it's a blatantly feel-good movie... It's that it's like watching several of those kinds of movies jockeying for space, and the pile-up turning into something that's too much yet not enough. -0.075\n",
      "There is a place for the crowd-pleaser, the tear-jerker, the movie that wants to manipulate your emotions and make you cry - particularly if it manages to bring something new to an old formula. 0.15075757575757576\n",
      "If you're in the market for a heart-warmer, look no further. 0.0\n",
      "Its brilliance lies in combining... well-tread tropes with an important sense of inclusion for a sweet story that truly sings. 0.375\n",
      "Only an utter malcontent could prove entirely resistant to Coda's charms. 0.0\n",
      "At the heart of CODA is the gradual understanding that... you can love someone without being able to understand everything they love themselves. 0.5\n",
      "Caring, boisterous, and adorned with the hugest of hearts. 0.0\n",
      "Jones is marvelous in a star-making role, lighting up the screen, her ASL an integral part of her performance, with a voice we know Berklee would be lucky to have on campus. 0.6666666666666666\n",
      "Heder's delicate but realistic writing and compassionate directing avoids cliches. -0.06666666666666667\n",
      "We might wish for a movie that centers a person who is deaf (baby steps, I guess) but \"CODA's\" depiction of Ruby as the outsider in her own family leads to plenty of rich, unexpected scenes. 0.35833333333333334\n",
      "On balance, it's worth seeing despite its weakness for picking songs for Ruby to sing that reflect exactly what she's hiding inside. 0.275\n",
      "Have some tissues handy. 0.6\n",
      "\"CODA\" is sweet, heartfelt, eye-opening and uplifting. It's a big hug of a movie, and we could all use a hug right now. 0.15892857142857142\n",
      "The actors work together seamlessly, the blue-collar coastal setting is richly realized and the family's cohesiveness solidly established. 0.15833333333333333\n",
      "There's a version of Siân Heder's film that might have been sincerely wonderful, and a real step forward for deaf representation. Alas, it's not this one at all. 0.26666666666666666\n",
      "\"CODA\" demonstrates that formulas are fine, if they're informed by true emotion and commitment. 0.3833333333333333\n",
      "Writer/director Sian Heder weaves a beautiful, nuanced and complex tale buoyed by delicate and deft performances. 0.21250000000000002\n",
      "Heder has finessed the story adroitly, putting a little more meat on the dramatic bones... -0.040277777777777767\n",
      "What is surprising is the moving, even heartbreaking, way writer-director Heder tells Ruby's story without resorting to clichéd characterizations or syrupy sentimentality. 0.7\n",
      "Pushes our buttons shamelessly, but also with enough sincerity, warmth and finesse to forestall accusations of rank manipulation. -0.4\n",
      "The climactic emotional beats are telegraphed almost from the beginning, but they still hit hard, effectively leaving viewers who can suspend their disbelief feeling uplifted and dewy-eyed. 0.10277777777777776\n",
      "Beyond its portrayal of a well-rounded deaf family, \"CODA\" may not revolutionary in its execution but it's like a memorable pop song: it has great hooks, a solid beat and it's fun to sing along to. 0.4\n",
      "Two parts raw and real, one part manipulative, Coda finds engaging characters and real emotions in a hackneyed narrative arc. 0.1423076923076923\n",
      "Sometimes a feel-good story hits the spot. \"CODA\" is one of those times. 0.0\n",
      "Writer-director Sian Heder's film is a genuinely sweet thing: The type of drama that loves its characters, and is determined to find a satisfying outcome for them. 0.425\n",
      "Grounded and sweet, delicately bawdy, and decidedly hilarious, Coda puts an effervescent and original spin on the coming-of-age comedy-drama. 0.23125\n",
      "Sweet, thoughtful, and unusual in its extensive use of sign language and its casting of deaf actors (including Oscar winner Marlee Matlin), it's the kind of film you can't help but love. 0.3416666666666666\n",
      "When writer/director Siân Heder's script explores the daily challenges and accomplishments of a deaf family, it thrives. When it ventures into broad comedy, not so much. 0.08750000000000001\n",
      "A witty, sweetly told drama about a hearing 17-year-old girl in a deaf Massachusetts fishing family. 0.425\n",
      "CODA is the kind of movie that makes you want to stand up and cheer. 0.6\n",
      "The film is at its most moving in those rare moments when it's capturing the nourishing bonding ritual among a deaf family. 0.4\n",
      "It's likeable but very familiar. 0.48750000000000004\n",
      "No surprises but strong hooks in Siân Heder's sweetly musical Sundance 2021 opener, which swept the main prizes in the fest's U.S. Dramatic Competition category. 0.04166666666666667\n",
      "A handful of sitcom-ish moments seem like small glitches in a script that works so winningly to bring the often unseen (or just terminally underexplored) world of deafness to such joyful, ordinary life. -0.08\n",
      "CODA is the kind of movie that you can imagine getting a standing ovation at Sundance, if this were a year where people were allowed to gather in a stuffy Park City auditorium. 0.6\n",
      "A sweet, openhearted coming-of-age story that succeeds in spite of its own predictability. 0.5499999999999999\n",
      "An undeniable charmer about juggling obligations to friends, family and self. When CODA hits the right notes in that balancing act, it's euphoric. 0.2857142857142857\n",
      "Too much of the film feels more informed by other movies than any real experience. 0.19374999999999998\n",
      "The plot is sometimes painfully predictable, and there are one too many musical montages, yet this improbably charismatic 18-year-old drags you over the bumps with a nuanced turn that veers from vulnerable to defeated to furiously determined. 0.06000000000000001\n",
      "Writer/director Sian Heder, with her exceptional cast, remains in full control of the tone even as the story follows every predictable beat. 0.2722222222222222\n",
      "This is Jones' film and she gives one of those young performances that feel like a pronouncement of someone who will be around for years. 0.1\n",
      "Coda is a mostly likable concoction, but one that's just too formulaic and ultimately rather calculated to secure the emotional response it so desperately wants by the big finale. 0.15714285714285717\n",
      "It may look recognizable, but Heder and her formidable cast and compelling emotion make sure it doesn't sound like anything else out there. 0.36250000000000004\n",
      "CODA is a radiant, deeply satisfying heartwarmer that more than embraces formula; it locates the pleasure and pureness in it, reminding us of the comforting, even cathartic, gratifications of a feel-good story well told. 0.5\n",
      "In its straightforward way, the film delivers an emotional knockout. It's a movie about a family, and by the end you may feel you know them as well as you know your own. 0.325\n"
