       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.<br/><br/>It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.<br/><br/>Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".<br/><br/>It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.<br/><br/>It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.<br/><br/>Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.<br/><br/>At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.<br/><br/>Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.<br/><br/>That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.<br/><br/>And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.<br/><br/>However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.<br/><br/>With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.<br/><br/>The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.<br/><br/>But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.</div>\n",

       "Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.<br/><br/>What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).<br/><br/>And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.<br/><br/>I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).<br/><br/>Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.<br/><br/>When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.<br/><br/>I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.<br/><br/>The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: \"I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.\"<br/><br/>The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It's easy to be nice when you're rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.<br/><br/>But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.<br/><br/>But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.<br/><br/>I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.<br/><br/>South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.<br/><br/>The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.<br/><br/>The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.<br/><br/>There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.<br/><br/>The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.<br/><br/>It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.<br/><br/>However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.</div>\n",

I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible.</div>\n",

       "<ul><li>The actors are good.</li><li>Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.</li><li>The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD:\n",
       "<ul><li>We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, \"Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.<br/><br/>The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a \"what if.\" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??<br/><br/>Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.<br/><br/>The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.<br/><br/>Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.<br/><br/>All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry.</div>\n",

It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.<br/><br/>Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie \"Us\" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.<br/><br/>Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell \"like butter\" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.<br/><br/>The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.</div>\n",

Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.<br/><br/>Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.<br/><br/>If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.<br/><br/>The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.<br/><br/>There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.<br/><br/>For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.</div>\n",

How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\n",

So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.<br/><br/>It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved \"Snowpiercer\" but this is total crap.</div>\n",

      "It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.\n",

      "I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\n",
      "Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.\n",

      "I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.\n",

      "In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: \"I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.\"The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It's easy to be nice when you're rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.\n",

      "A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.\n",

      "PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time.

      "As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives.

      "This movie is not a \"masterpiece\" by any means. And all the apparent hype it's getting? Why? Is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an \"American film\"? (That is, trying to be an American \"genre\" film?)THE GOOD:The actors are good.Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.THE BAD:We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, \"Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a \"what if.\" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry.\n",

      "Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money.\n",

      "This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie \"Us\" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell \"like butter\" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.\n",

      "Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say \"social climbing\". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn.

      "\"It's so metaphorical\" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that \"It's so metaphorical\" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.\"It's so metaphorical\" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.\n",

      "There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.\n",

Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\n",

So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion.

Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement.

In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes.

With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved \"Snowpiercer\" but this is total crap.\n"

       "[['It\\'s not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn\\'t like the second half of it.It\\'s much easier to understand the message of a movie when the \\'good guys\\' win or the \\'bad guys\\' get punished in the end. I\\'m not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there\\'s a character with a clearer \\'moral center\\' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it\\'s no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don\\'t understand Ki-Taek\\'s motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".It\\'s a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people\\'s privacy or as one should mind one\\'s own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families\\' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to \\'cross the line\\' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it\\'s quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park\\'s house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park\\'s family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn\\'t even smell like him.Ki-Taek\\'s final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son\\'s shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek\\'s daughter\\'s status who\\'s dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the \\'line\\' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those \\'lesser\\' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those \\'proper\\' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek\\'s family to sneak into Mr. Park\\'s house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park\\'s family, their existence is no better than that of a \\'parasite\\', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host\\'s body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park\\'s or Ki-Taek\\'s personalities. Instead, it\\'s a \\'line\\' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn\\'t change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.'],\n",
       " [\"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\\nParasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.\"],\n",

It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action.

       " ['In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: \"I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.\"The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It\\'s easy to be nice when you\\'re rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it\\'s a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they\\'ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can\\'t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it\\'s all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you\\'re like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you\\'ve just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho\\'s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he\\'ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he\\'s done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can\\'t afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It\\'s nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.'],\n",
       " [\"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.\"],\n",

As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives.

It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life.

       " ['This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie \"Us\" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell \"like butter\" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.'],\n",

Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim\\'s family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won\\'t be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.'],\n",
       " [\"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.\"],\n",

Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\\nIf you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it.

      "It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.\n",

And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry.\n",
      "Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money.\n",
      "Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say \"social climbing\". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.Now, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn. And it's not pretty. But what is pretty is the way Bong Joon-ho manages to blend dark humor with biting social commentary like a master chef whipping up a gourmet meal.\n",
      "\"It's so metaphorical\" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that \"It's so metaphorical\" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.\"It's so metaphorical\" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.\n",
      "There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.\n",
      "This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\n",
      "If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive.\n",
      "When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!\n",
      "When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece.\n",
      "The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect.\n",
      "A veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved \"Snowpiercer\" but this is total crap.\n",
      "The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.\n",
      "What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean \"they\" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.\n",
      "You could easily argue that \"parasite\" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!\n",
      "There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an \"idyllic\" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!\n",
      "Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity.\n",
      "Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene. It elaborates the dark side of social disparity masterfully. I have not seen such a intense and impressive movie for a long time.\n",
      "Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including \"how\" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.\n",
      "This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10\n",
      "Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no \"good guy\" and \"bad guy\" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!\n",
      "After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!\n",
      "This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks\n",
      "very subtly written, amazing comedia\n",
      "I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars\n",
      "And it deserves more than this\n",
      "Best Korean movie ever made!\n",
      "----------I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol\n",
      "I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.\n",
      "There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a \"metaphorical masterpiece\" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants.\n",
      "This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars\n",
      "This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year.\n",
      "I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.\n",
      "This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeousCho Yeo-jeongfor whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!\n",
      "Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz.\n",
      "A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?\"Parasite\" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film.\n",
      "Is the fact that people who voted for it to win the Cannes film festival award and those who gave it anything higher than a 7/10 on this platform, actually exist.A family living below the poverty line in a 1st world nation whose kids couldn't pass the national exams or fold a pizza box would suddenly become world class con artistes overnight infiltrating a wealthy family? And when things took a dark turn, we the audience are supposed to feel sorry for them, just because they are poor, nevermind their greed, pride and total lack of character?Please don't insult our intelligence, at least 1 out of 3 accounts here are real and still give honest review.\n",
      "This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future.\n",
      "This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already.\n",
      "Extreme! Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a good criticism about the rich and poor in the world.. the movie is really interesting and pretty sad... worth it. Please watch it. You will not regret it.\n",
      "This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor\n",

      "11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times.\n",
      "The film starts off as a Lucille Ball/Vivian Vance escapade and ends as Quentin Tarantino drama. I guess that's what we call fluidity.\n",
      "Parasite is terrific. The cast is embraceable. The actors were recognized by the Screen Actor's Guild for the \"Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\" Hurray for Parasite.\n",
      "How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years.\n",
      "There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.\n",
      "Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!\n",
      "I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really.\n",
      "This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a \"masterpiece.\" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one.\n",
      "For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love.\n",
      "I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!\n",

      "It talks about how poor and rich \"nice\" people see each other\n",

      "Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape.\n",
      "This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10\n",
      "With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all.\n",
      "Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range.\n",
      "As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory.\n",
      "A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...\n",
      "It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them \"lovable\". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.Post Oscars Addition:\n",
      "Technically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I'm sure that most fans don't care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money. But think about that: someone did build the house where we all want to live in, right? And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn't it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?\n",

      "11/09/19Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:Part One:Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you \"Terminator: Dark Fate,\" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie \"Playing with Fire,\" will keep you company while you wait.Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.\n",
      "When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible.\n",
      "From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10.\n",
      "I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening.\n",
      "This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser.\n",
      "Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles.\n",
      "It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019.\n",
      "Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately.\n",
      "Well written and performed. Technically shines through and through. Probably the best experience in recent memory. Its pure art resembles and the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss this film. Definitely tops the list of best movies this past year too.\n",
      "I don't really understand the high rate for the movie, it is very normal expected movie.\n",
      "This is not about social inequality. This is about a bunch of con artists who take advantage of a naive wealthy family. Its story is convoluted, far too long, and people are grasping to find depth. I've already wasted too much time on this so I'm not writing anything further.\n",
      "I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.It's such a fantastic social commentary.\n",
      "Original, creative, involving story.Great acting with a crisp production.One of the best in 2019\n",
      "One of the best films!\n",
      "The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes.\n",
      "If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie.\n",
      "One of the best movies in 2019\n",
      "There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!\n",
      "The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!\n",
      "Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language.\n",
      "I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie.\n",
      "Hilarious at times, weird, with some unexpected plot twists. Shows that whether you are rich or poor, the life you lead is really is just as futile........update: Yessss I am so happy that it has now won an oscar for best movie ! Well deserved!\n",
      "I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10\n",
      "Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie.\n",
      "Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!\n",
      "Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded.\n",
      "So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation.\n",
      "Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love.\n",
      "Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.A masterpiece.\n",
      "Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches.\n",
      "It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.\n",
      "Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.\n",
      "Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end\n",
      "It was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why I gave it a 9. The only con I had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and I had an ending playing out in my head that I thought was going to happen and thought it would be great. I was way off course. Which is also a great pro at the same time.\n",
      "Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea.\n",
      "This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb\n",
      "Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019.\n",
      "Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion.\n",
      "To be frank on my first watch I didn't feel much great about the movie... But then I read, watched some videos and now I enjoy the movie very much... It's an artistic beauty... I guess for usual audience (like me) it's just an okay movie but we need to dig this movie deeper to enjoy it completely\n",
      "Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.\n",
      "Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype.\n",
      "With this tough genre mix, South Korean cinema has created a masterpiece. The complex and fascinating examination of the class struggle once again underpins the ingenuity of its director Bong Joon-Ho.\n",
      "You have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it.\n",
      "This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece.\n",
      "Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.\n",
      "Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.\n",
      "The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious.\n",
      "I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle. While I was entertained, I was shocked that this movie won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Picture over the far superior 1917.\n",
      "This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it.\n",
      "When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry.\n",
      "This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters.\n",
      "It's a simple hype job.\n",
      "The movie here is the real Parasite.\n",
      "This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work.\n",
      "We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.\n",
      "Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.\n",
      "In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.\n",
      "This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.\n",
      "Their crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner.\n",
      "The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host.\n",
      "Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.Don't miss it\n",
      "Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019.\n",
      "You may not like everything you see, but you will be moved. I can't add much to the many excellent reviews here except to say that this is a film for true film lovers, not movie-goers. It's a film that makes you laugh, cry and most of all, think. Do not try to interpret the plot literally. The story is metaphoric. Zen, not Hollywood.\n",
      "Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result.\n",
      "I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE\n",
      "The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again.\n",
      "The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes.\n",
      "This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average.\n",
      "Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.\n",
      "Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay.\n",
      "The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers.\n",
      "Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days.\n",
      "Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify.\n",
      "My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!\n",
      "I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.\n",
      "Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\n",
      "Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested.\n",
      "This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense.\n",
      "The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more.\n",
      "Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!\n",
      "I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.What a film.\n",
      "I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got \"Snowpiercer\" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend.\n",
      "The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade. With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling, acting, script etc) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it.\n",
      "Beautiful movie congratulations. story beautiful movie\n",
      "Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.\n",
      "I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects.\n",
      "Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema.\n",
      "I don't know whether if it's just me but each member of the \"parasitic\" family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves. It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on-screen.\n",
      "The film starts out portraying the Kim family, their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich. A \"lucky stone\" introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait, clinging to the narrator throughout the plot. The all-too-powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon.\n",
      "One of them leading to the protogonists' running away from the affluent Park's home after an eventful night. This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers. This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me- the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of \"actions gone too far\" makes you feel for them.\n",
      "The transformation that the narrator's father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio- economic casteism that is present in our world.\n",
      "A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!\n",
      "Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period.\n",
      "Parasite = 7/10Positive:-The premise is incredibly exciting and builds up a great game with the double lives of the protagonists in the first half.-The film has an incredibly ingenious plot. The premise alone is captivating. As the film progresses, a funny comedy becomes more and more of a thriller/splatter, which brings a great twist to the plot.-The dialogues are surprisingly interesting and funny. Above all, the dialogues between the two families and the gap between rich and poor that arise are captivating.-Not only the dialogues but also the entire game and the building of emotions is perfect. How the hatred of the rich family slowly increases and the disgusting behavior of the upper class is explained is fascinating.-The socially critical commentary that is repeatedly interspersed into the film is clever and gives the film another level.-The twist halfway through the film that the housewife's husband lives in the basement was a shock and brings a huge and surprising turn to the story.Negative:-Unfortunately, our protagonists are not likeable. It is a group of losers and impostors who end up committing cruel acts.-The ending isn't perfect and the film would have needed more time to process the events. The characters commit terrible acts. The film doesn't glorify this behavior but still portrays them as the good ones, which is reprehensible. In the end they are still the victims, but the film forgets that they got themselves into this situation because they wanted quick money.All the deaths, both within the family and the murders they committed, are never dealt with.-The film does criticize society but in a very weak way. In the end, the poor are the good victims and the rich are the vain evil ones.Conclusion: A good and clever black comedy. Unfortunately, parts of it are too black, so in places it forgets to shed light on the morals of the characters and never discourages bad deeds such as murder. Still a good and exciting film. But unfortunately overrated.\n",
      "The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again.\n",
      "Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point.\n",
      "Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.Masterpiece? Yes.\n",
      "Would I watch it again? Heck no.\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hypeIts good, but not top 50 goodI feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exoticAsk yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is.\n",
      "I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10.\n",
      "I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped.\n",
      "Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed.\n",
      "It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino ..\n",
      "Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .Kudo's\n",
      "Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more.\n",
      "Just watched this film yesterday, really love this story. And surprised the academy even knowledged it.😳\n",
      "I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it.\n",
      "As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite.\n",
      "One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it.\n",
      "This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder.\n",
      "It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.\n",
      "I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't.\n",
      "I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters.\n",
      "I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable.\n",
      "And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas.\n",
      "\"Snowpiercer\" was very good, \"Parasite\" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in \"Parasite\", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, \"Parasite\" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture.\n",
      "Great movie, great writing, greating acting and great cinamotography. The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending.I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery. After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there, that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers.\n",
      "I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!Almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.The production and performance were magnificent. The humour \"Black comedy\" was great, the \"Pain\" was real and the cinematography was dazzling.I'd like to thank Bong Joon-ho in person for this masterpiece!\"Poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable\"9.2/10\n",
      "My favorite movie of 2019..\n",
      "Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture\n",
      "This movie is a masterpiece\n",
      "I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits.\n",
      "Was expecting a great movie about social inequality. I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating. But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status. It is about a down on their luck con artist family. Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for. But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting. Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears. But then the family lies, manipulates, and scams two people to get fired. Deplorable. Do people do this cause they are poor? No, it's cause they are criminals. There are criminals at all social levels. So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality. How disappointing.. but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers. But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel.\n",
      "Cinema at its best. Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!\n",
      "I went into Parasite blind, I literally almost knew nothing going in and that was probably a good thing. Parasite is flat out a work of art. A lot of films can be considered brilliant or a masterpiece but this film is definitely one of them.Parasite is one of the freshest films I've seen in ages. It's a story which is executed so well. It's a work of art and the whole film is complex, funny and somewhat terrifying at times. Both the first and second half of this film are both works of art. It is one of the best written films of the year and of the decade.Everyone is terrifc. Kang-Ho Song and the cast are incredible. There is no faults in the performances. The cinematography is also absolutely wonderful and it's seriously well directed.There isn't anything negative to say. It's one of the best of the year and decade. It's whatever everyone has been saying and I wouldn't mind this winning best picture.\n",
      "I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars\n",
      "Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor.\n",
      "An instant classic! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch. Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the \"top\". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film's atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life.\n",
      "First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this.\n",
      "Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling \"Parasite,\" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none.\n",
      "Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..\n",
      "One of my best films, rarely comes across such a fascinating work that satisfies the soul's need to receive and taste creativity and art. According to Hegel, the soul also has its needs,i think that the parasite has fulfilled it.\n",
      "See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.And the \"wealth rock\" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one \"scot-free\" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets \"lesson learned (maybe)\". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, \"aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan\". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. \"The whole notion of \"why bother\" makes no sense or point thematically in art.\n",
      "I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper/more groundbreaking than it actually is. It has the plot of a rom-com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary. Wow! Class differences exist! Thanks Bong Joon-ho for enlightening me.Just because you've successfully deciphered what the director/writer sought to convey doesn't mean he's necessarily saying anything profound. People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that, despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film, its significance remains painfully surface-level.I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves--and it's fitting. During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events, I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture (alongside the universal acclaim).Well, after the former housekeeper's return, the stupidity that ensues (yes--that moment and the very end inclusive) signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise. However, it's here where the film starts to break down for me.We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening. That's ok for some time, for some genres, but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy. The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to. And on top of it, I genuinely don't care what happens to any of these people (save a tinge of regret for Mr. Park's taking a knife to the chest), I find it impossible that the tutor-son could survive two (2) skull-crushing throws of a rock to the head, and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr. Kim committing the murder in the first place, even given the heat of the moment and his motivations.I was almost peer-pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I've seen none so low as mine, but 3 just feels right. Something unconnected that I need to insert; the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn't even there for me either. It's smirk-with-one-corner-of-the-mouth funny throughout, but never really hilarious. It's prettiness is its strongest feature and to say otherwise is contrived.\n",
      "Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it.\n",
      "I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars.\n",
      "This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed.\n",
      "If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you.\n",
      "I just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful. It is a mix of moments that happen as fun, joy, tensions and sadness. The climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting, you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen, everything flowed very well. I'm amazed at the movie, a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday!NOTE: The counterpoint of the rain scene is \"because of the rain the rich can't get to camp\" and \"because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp (in the gym)\"\n",
      "I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10.\n",
      "It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go.\n",
      "I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure.\n",
      "Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades.\n",
      "Parasite is a highly polished and pretty-looking movie but it falls short in a few ways. My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of \"tonal whiplash\", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home? I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film.\n",
      "This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece \" parasites\". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade.\n",
      "From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem.\n",
      "This is a very rich film \"with metaphors\" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem.\n",
      "It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!\n",
      "One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.\n",
      "Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence.\n",
      "A fabulous director.\n",
      "This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device.\n",
      "This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some \"drama\" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it.\n",
      "This is a rollercoaster of a film,it starts off with us seeing the situation of a poor family,the friend of the family's son gives him an offer of his job and tells him to forge his graduation documents,after learning the son needs an art tutor he lies to get his sister in,I can talk about a lot of things,but the garden scene,phew what a scene. The underground husband stabs Jessica (the sister),the father attempts to save his daughter,Mr park asks for the car keys,the father tosses them and...well anyone who's seen the film knows the scene,bong joon-ho has proven he is an amazing director worthy of winning many rewards with this film alone\n",
      "This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project.\n",
      "After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all.\n",
      "I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice.\n",
      "I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie.\n",
      "An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.\n",
      "There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.\n",
      "Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.\n",
      "Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,\n",
      "Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.\n",
      "Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.\n",
      "In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?\n",
      "A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy\n",
      "Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.\n",
      "Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.\n",
      "The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.\n",
      "The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.\n",
      "The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.\n",
      "However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.\n",
      "Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.\n",
      "The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes.\n",
      "Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it.\n",
      "This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.The movie was good. Lol.\n",
      "This is true masterpiece\n",
      "It's unpredictable i love this movie\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!\n",
      "Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars.\n",
      "Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻\n",
      "The movie is not what I expected. And not as brilliant as it was being told. I chhod have easily skipped this without regret.\n",
      "What a great movie. No words. For very long moments I was so immersed that I forgot I was watching a movie. The plot is greatly crafted. It always moves forward and escalates. When the story requires it, the tension is remarkable. I think the father's reason to kill Mr Park could've been established a little clearer, but anyway the movie is great.\n",
      "Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it.\n",
      "At first sight I gave 10, but being close to the end of the movie I was thinking...\"no, no 10, but 8\", because I doubted how they could miss what was with Moon-gwang, and then the story mentioned what was with her and I moved back to 10. :) The whole concept is great, from the story, music and photography to acting and style. Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially.\n",
      "The suspense, drama, accuracy with the real life, visually amazing. It's just beautiful.\n",
      "I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His \"heroes\" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself \"Jessica\" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces \"Uncle Kim\" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the \"uncle\" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When \"Uncle Kim\" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).When Moon-kwang discovers the new \"hired help\" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is \"permitting the outrage without the consequences.\" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet.\n",
      "A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly.\n",
      "I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable.\n",
      "For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people. And a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy.\n",
      "In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great .\n",
      "This movie can thinking everything many type of question & ending is super-level....\n",
      "This movie lives in this time\n",
      "An amazing sweet thriller movie.\n",
      "Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood\n",
      "This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better\n",
      "After watching the most overrated korean movie ever \"the burning\", I almost lost the trust on imdb reviews but this movie put my trust back. It has everything, comedy , thrilling elements, suspense, emotional moments, satire and each and every actor played their role perfectly. It was treat to watch this movie. Highly recommended, just go for it.\n",
      "A movie that doesn't really belong to any genre. Still impresive story telling. One of the best of 2019\n",
      "I rated this a 7 yesterday but after a full day of thinking about it, I must say it's really good. Slow burn, it has everything in it. Unpredictable and makes you react outloud\n",
      "It was pretty dang good man, I just personally thought it was a bit overrated. Maybe I'm to simple to get the major messages of the film, but hey man, check it out. This movie is a piece of film history.\n",
      "Epic tale of class distinctions in modern-day South Korea. Ironic, clever, and touching.\n",
      "This is way way over rated, its a 6 at best. Yes some bits are funny. But others it just drags on. The actings okay. Plots okay. Its just really an okay film overall. Nothing special.\n",
      "A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life.\n",
      "This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft.\n",
      "So, you think you're going to \"fast track\" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)So you decide to take the \"easy\" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.But one night...~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~...comes a flood.And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.Look at how wrong you were.In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.Until then.\n",
      "I generally never watch foreign language movies because I'm annoyed by the subtitles. But this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals, the acting, the premise the shifts in the tone, you never know what's going to happen next. I don't understand Korean but still I could connect and realte to the characters.\n",
      "After watching Joker, I wasn't expecting any other film this year to even come near it. But this came out like an underdog! Both are 10 on 10 for me.\n",
      "I wish such movies are made more. I hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films. This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear.\n",
      "Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award.\n",
      "This was one of the most entertaining and enthralling movies I'd seen all year. Everything, from the pacing, filming, characters, story, and dialogue all converge upon the viewer's brain, exciting them neurons like fireworks, bathing our cortices with explosive brain juice! Every scene has a purpose, and builds upon the story, leading up to its climatic ending.\n",
      "Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.\n",
      "Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.\n",
      "The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it.\n",
      "From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie. This truly original story was a once in a lifetime journey that had me laughing, crying and frighten all in one sitting. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself!\n",
      "Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical.\n",
      "This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent.\n",
      "Quick. Metaphorical. Social. Postmodern. Beautiful.You miss if you don't watch it.\n",
      "I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!\n",
      "One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional.\n",
      "I don't want to be a troll but this movie is a bit overrated i think. We have much better dramas in Turkish cinema.\n",
      "Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film.\n",
      "I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet.\n",
      "The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film.\n",
      "Best film I've seen in a long while, great plot good twist highly recommended\n",
      "A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish.\n",
      "Never Expected this kind of Movie...This movie literally contains all elements.... Brilliant Direction,Music,and acting....Must watch movie\n",
      "One thing I always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like \"yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal. Movie is fast paced and I quite liked the ending. Surely one of the best movie of this decade\n",
      "I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative.\n",
      "The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other.\n",
      "Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special.\n",
      "Its a very good movie thats it. but very overrated.\n",
      "Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year\n",
      "This film is an ok film. It has some funny moments, some agony moments and a little drama. I can't say I had a hard time watching it. But I really can't understand how people lost their minds. The poor family with all these lies get a very nice job with good money. Yet they still don't move out from the basement, they decide to continue living in there and not moving out to start living a better life. They even throw a party to the mansion and thinking how they can take more from the rich. So am I supposed to feel sorry for them at the end? The movie doesn't imply that the rich family are greedy or they stole money from others for themselves. Mr Park seem to working pretty hard to be in that position and to earn his money. They pay well the working staff and even extra is some occasions. Of course they seem to be discussed by the poor but they don't offend them in any way throughout the film. So to me they are more \"likeable\" than the poor family. Overall is a good movie but that's it. I literally don't understand the hype.\n",
      "So much to unpack. incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography. Well written script. Masterful suspense, so many metaphors! the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over. I was captivated through the whole movie.I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea/South Korea as well as social class, but I haven't seen anyone else point that out, so it could be me grasping at straws.For the main family, the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began, minus the father and daughter. Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook are presumably still struggling, at the bottom of the stairs again. Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away. Thus describes Bong Joon-Ho's ruthless realism; the poor get poorer, and life continues on with no plan to fix anything.Not that that matters, it wouldn't work anyway.\n",
      "Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, wonderfully written screenplay, artist style and cinematography. Too much to talk about, just WATCH this movie.\n",
      "Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances.\n",
      "One of the best film in foreign language !!!\n",
      "Actually it's not a film,\n",
      "It's our real life story...\n",
      "I have nothing more to say about this great creation.....\n",
      "One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today.\n",
      "What's funny is that the parasites in Hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family.When the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons. That scene where she's smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful.Although, much like Hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of Vertigo, the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved. It wasn't built up to properly. It felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces weren't placed to justify it, for the audience or the character.If your DAUGHTER just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the DAUGHTER KILLER as inspiration for killing the rich guy COMPLETELY OUT OF LEFT FIELD. Sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him, but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb.I don't believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending. This is purely a trashy parasitical rich person's fantasy.It's a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick.\n",
      "I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?\n",
      "THATS THE WHOLE POINT!\n",
      "ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a \"feel good movie\" to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed... the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such... so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families.. Are the rich really \"evil\" for ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? How people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad..\n",
      "This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. \"Parasite\" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - \"\"If you make a plan, life never works out that way\". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!\n",

      "First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days.\n",

      "The Kims are a struggling lower class family. One day the son gets an opportunity from a friend. He also gets some good-luck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film. He can work as an English tutor for a rich family. His sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears US educated. He gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee. The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn't home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age. But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he's some kind of painter prodigy. That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an \"art therapist\" for the troubled son. So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she's meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper. They succeed. When the Parks leave for a weekend, the Kims celebrate in the mansion. Then the former housekeeper shows up. She reveals that there is a secret basement where she's been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money. Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her. She takes some video. The families fight over the video. Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon. The Kims hide under the living room table. The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured. Her husband is bound back in his basement room.Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room. There's heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded. Then they get a call from the Parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day. In the middle of the party, the housekeeper's husband has freed himself. and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim's head in with his good luck rock, then attacks daughter Kim with a knife. Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims. That leads father Kim to attack Park after he's taken care of the housekeeper's husband.Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working/scheming family and the wealthy/naive family whose \"problems\" are mostly blown up minor issues. The characters are slightly cartoonish. Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2/3rds of the movie. You do end up rooting for the Kims. The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse. It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn't recover. From then on you know and expect something you happen, you just don't know from which direction it will come. In the end it's somewhat of a surprise but it doesn't amount to much really.Sure, economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor, no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable, thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed. It's not so much about class warfare but rather codependency. As with any codependent relationship, there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments. But there is no major message in the movie. It could have don't more with the theme but it went for an easy solution, one that doesn't solve anything.\n",
      "Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!\n",
      "This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough. The whole story is quite metaphoric,hinting the notion of class struggle. However , in my opinion I think the metaphors are too explicit and at the same time can be disturbing.\n",
      "It just ain't oscar- wrothy!\n",
      "PARASITE (2019)I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing.\n",

      "Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own.\n",
      "I felt a roller coaster of emotions watching this movie; everything about it so perfectly executed. What makes this movie insanely good is the actors, story, plot and narrative.Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???\n",
      "The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!\n",
      "Definitely not worth more than 8 stars. A good movie to watch at home but not at the theatre.\n",
      "Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10.\n",

      "Cinematographically really an awesome film, great actors, storytelling, gripping. But maybe it´s only me, I can´t make out a plot that ties all together, unfortunately. So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no.\n",
      "After watching the movie I checked IMDB score.There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.A complete nonsense.After a hour, you start to look at the screen and say \"WHY?\".All nonsense movies gets some award from the festival juries. I think they may wanna show off something like \"we understood the sarcasm but you don't\".\n",
      "This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens.\n",
      "Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone. This genre-defying film picks up the social differences between rich and poor and mix it up with some of the best twists in the entire history of cinema.\n",
      "I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it.\n",
      "It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece.\n",
      "Korean film makers literally have such a interesting mind. Absolutely unique and a film I'll never forget!\n",

      "GOOD movie but itS not amazing\n",
      "This movie is overrated\n",
      "In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating. One i like from this movie is description between rich and poor. I like this part a lot, that's why this movie got an oscar. But overall is not good as rating.\n",
      "Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.Do yourself a favor and watch this film.\n",
      "Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?\n",
      "I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire.\n",

      "Comedy drama.I was attracted to this after seeing the many recent and different awards and commendations.Rich / poor family contrasts. The poor family manipulate the rich family with private highly recommended services. Each member of the poor family use their wit to become an English tutor, Art Therapist, Driver and Housekeeper. The rich family are completely oblivious to their new elite home help, or to what's really going on!The film does a good job of demonstrating social structure, but a little cliché in places. I wanted it to blow my socks off, and in the end I'm bewildered to how this has won so many awards.I'd say this is a well made film but have seen better.\n",
      "I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that \"the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good\". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the \"really good\" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)\n",

      "Much like it's creature name sake, Bong Joon-ho' s Parasite is a movie that latches on to you and won't let go. The story of Parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family, the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything. Multiple times in the film, We are shown scenes of the humiliation, abuse and the depravity of the poor family, the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away. The shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value.Parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us.\n",

      "But in the end, \"Parasite\", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.\n",
      "9,8 / 10\n",
      "A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre.\n",
      "This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so.\n",
      "Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival.\n",
      "This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes.\n",
      "Disturbingly good. Even though I don't like the plot and the ending, there are so many messages in the movie. And this is not american fairy tale, so watched it and I realized this movie was not made to entertain myself.\n",
      "I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!\n",
      "This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated.\n",
      "Ridiculous, implausible plot; heavy handed allegory at best. Overdrawn caricatures of rich and poor. I guess some viewers found this funny, but nobody laughed in the theater. The worst was the gratuitous violence near the end, shown with graphic detail.\n",
      "Inspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one..\n",
      "So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues...\n",
      "It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.Great movie, very psycho!\n",
      "I watched this movie three times.\n",
      "it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said.\n",
      "there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube.\n",
      "I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep.\n",
      "light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful.\n",
      "The movie starts slowly and shows us who the family lives. Despite the unmoral functioning of the family, that pretend to be someone their not to their benefict, after the major plot twist in the midle of film, the tension dont stop rising and the ansiety keeps increasing until a crazy final conflict. The resolution of the final dont explain to much but have satisfied me.\n",
      "After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family.\n",
      "I'm also gonna build myself a bunker.\n",
      "In 1938 The Grand Illusion was the first foreign film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Since then, ten others have been nominated and in 2019 Parasite was the first to win.Bong Joon-Ho described the film as symbolic of the class barrier in Korea and symbolism is the only description or justification for the movie; which is very unorthodox in its plot, structure and overall style.\n",
      "The catalyst the film is Kevin accepting to fill in for his friend as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's daughter. The first act ends when the entire Kim family secures a job in the Park residence. After that the story starts to lose control.\n",
      "At first, the film quickly advances in a clipped, transient style. Bong Joon-Ho establishes the setting and composition of his film and then sets forth. No scene lingers too long and each sets the other up so by just seeing the tail end of it the audience understands what's happened. The characters are quirky and idiosyncratic black humor is bestrewed throughout creating a light and comedic tone. And then out of nowhere the film takes a sharp turn with the Kim's discovering the former maid's husband, Geun-sae, living in the basement. Ho has admitted he is an Alfred Hitchcock fan(clearly demonstrated by the Hitchcock collection in the Park house) and attempted to imitate the incredible twists that became a trademark of The Master Of Suspense. However, Parasite's twist fails to deliver the punch that those in Psycho, North By Northwest and Vertigo do. It doesn't change the story or further complicate it but instead creates an entirely new and separate plot. Don't get me wrong, a good twist in a movie is meant to alter its course(e.g. Judy/Madeleine's identity revealed in Vertigo) or when placed at the very end to completely alter your perception of all that you just saw(Citizen Kane, The Sixth Sense, Psycho) In Parasite no new dimension is added to the film but essentially everything leading up is made irrelevant.\n",
      "For roughly the last half, the movie meanders with no direction before finally collapsing. The birthday party 'finale' is shocking and senseless. What prompts both men to murder, particularly Mr. Kim, is unknown. Is it a final accumulation of his contempt for the upper class ? Whatever it is, everything that follows drags like car with no wheels. Bong Joon-Ho brings the pace to a near halt and spends the final moments of this film trying to pile on every last bit of emotion and sentiment possible. And as always, all impact is only sucked out by the ennui and frustration.Since I don't understand Korean I can't accurately judge the dialogue or\n",
      "acting because no matter how precise a translation is, something is always lost.\n",
      "One is merely left to follow with the subtitles and what an actor emotes non-verbally-which can never be the same.Parasite is a film that probably resembles half a dozen genres...which means it doesn't cover any properly. The movie is very unconventional and not without some amusing elements but collectively it fails to deliver on any level.\n",
      "So maybe I'm an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation... but whatever it may be, I'm not sure I understand the hype around this movie.Don't get me wrong, it was good... but it wasn't all that. To be honest I thought it was just above average. I think I may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise. The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in.I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed. Regardless, this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that I would still recommend.\n",
      "This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director.\n",
      "Probably one of the most overrated movies in recent years. If I had to summarize this movie to someone that hasn't watched it I would say it's a movie about a poor family that manages to get into some rich family's house and they end up being killed by some random psycho that was hiding in the basement for years. I liked some parts of the movie, especially the first half but it kept getting worse and more random every second. What is the moral of this story? Not having a plan is always better? Life can change in a split second? I don't get the end of the story nor do I know why the guy decided to kill the people he killed. The definition of overrated.\n",
      "Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror.\n",
      "Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film.\n",
      "The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events.\n",
      "This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane.There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. Now that's a real thriller.Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class.\n",
      "I have a feeling I won't see a movie this good or affecting for a long time. Funny and scary and thrilling and sad\n",
      "Stunning screenplay and wonderful acting by the whole team members. Director took the story to the next leave of film. The ending and the start of the story is obviously awesome. Thanks I enjoyed this Movie and loved it . The best Korean Film I have ever watched in this decade.\n",
      "Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece.\n",
      "There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, \"It's a magic trick.\"I don't care if you \"can't take subtitles,\" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece.\n",
      "Clever idea but ended up being farcical.\n",
      "Excellent acting and original plot however how it ended up into a murder spree is where it was let down.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best movies that I've seen in 2019.\n",
      "Absoultly Overrated movie. Its a normal movie not so so good\n",
      "This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!\n",
      "Just wanted to register my \"10\" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted.\n",
      "Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all.\n",
      "The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.\n",
      "My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time\n",
      "One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie\n",
      "Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!\n",
      "But I really don't love it as much as all the fuss. It did not deserve to sweep the Oscars. Didn't love it\n",
      "Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece, is incredibly dim-witted. I'll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast.1. Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family's house.They say it's hard to cover up one lie. You know what's harder? Covering up a whole lot of them and that's what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.2. Kevin's best friend problemYour best friend has gave you an opportunity, to earn some cash, to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad. He also tells you that he's coming back and will ask the rich's family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he's interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn't.What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his \"best friend\", and also finds out the \"best friend\" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man's family, working under false pretenses.A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you?\n",
      "B: Expose you and your entire family?Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.Anyone care to tell me? The answer is B! They would be exposed! Who would have thought about that right!?3. Dining in the rich man's house like you own the placeAlso, with your whole family without a care in the world. Yeah, let us make a mess of this table, get the wine, get the snacks, let's leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here! Oh crap, the rich man family is coming back? Help! I left so much mess here, what do I do now?4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I'm going to die.Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C'mon. There's only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character.I could go on and on. The rock and its supposed \"symbolism\" that doesn't exist. How the ending went down, the absurd morse code. But I'm tired, tired of people over glorifying, thinking this is masterpiece when it isn't, of people explaining the \"hidden meaning\" of symbolism in different scenes that doesn't exist. Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status, how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status. How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism.All in all, I don't actually think the movie was all that bad. But grossly overrated. Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has.If you think otherwise, you've been factually proven wrong.\n",
      "Excellent writing, acting, direction, drama, suspense and action. A must see this year.\n",
      "This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.\n",
      "A movie that not only highlights the difference between the upper economy class and the lower economy class but also wraps around the emotions associated when two classes meet at some point.If you are looking to watch something that's realistic, including drama, story, and emotions, PARASITE is one such movie. No spoilers, but it will leave a lasting impact in recognizing the everyday struggle of the earning member belonging to a lower middle class and how he has to go through tons of emotions hiding the pain from his family members.While also, how such people aspire to become similar to the ones they are working for.\n",
      "The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards.\n",
      "Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did.\n",
      "I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!!\n",
      "Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious.\n",
      "I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see.\n",
      "This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019\n",
      "Parasite is perfect reflection of the era that we live in. I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie.\n",
      "Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them.\n",
      "Things I like:\n",

      "#Last 5 minutes ( I thing it was not necessery to show us what happened after the birthday party)\n",
      "I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end\n",
      "This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized.\n",
      "Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie\n",
      "The best way to view this movie is like the movie Get Out. If you do not know what it's about, it's to your advantage. Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention. If you're still reading this, then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line:I can't stop checking every nook and cranny of my house now. If you know, you know.\n",
      "I could not quite grasp the idea of the movie because of the inconsistent characters. Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script. Unfolding of the events push the credibility of the movie to the level of cartoons watched by the kids. Watchable but not an Oscar movie in my opinion.\n",
      "This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie.\n",
      "I had a very high expectation for \"Parasite\", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!\n",
      "Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.\n",
      "Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it.\n",
      "Parasite\n",
      "I think the most brilliant part of this film is the construction of 3 spaces:the house lived by Park's family, the basement lived by Kim Ki-woo's family,and the basement under the house ,which is lived by the original housekeeper's husband.The design of the 3 spaces is a metaphor for the difference in the classes of the 3 family. Every time Kim Ki-woo goes to the house to teach the girl, he has to go on a slope. And when the family run away from the house they have to go down stairs. The rich people living in the house can see the sunshine and grassland, while the family living in the basement can only see passerby's foot, and the man living under the house can never see anything outside that basement. The movie indicates the different living conditions between people in different classes.And the design of the spaces also matches the title of the movie,which is the parasite. Kim Ki-woo's family lives like a parasite. They hide themselves under the table listening the complaints about their smell from the rich. What between the different spaces is the line that can't be crossed.The movie constructed an illusion that the poor living in the rich's house and enjoy the life as the rich does. However, the illusion is broken and all of the poor come back to the real world when the real rich come home. In the real world, those rich people have not only wealth but power. They utilize those who want to climb up and push them when they near the top.It reflects the hidden unfairness in the capitalism. The owner of the power creates a dream for those down on the ground, and encourage them to climb up. But everything end up as foam. It is just like what the movie The Great Gatsby, which talks about a man's dream breaks.\n",
      "While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached. It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed...? Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family. Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people, getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction. When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in...? She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases. The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion. All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment. I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it.The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion (that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless). The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don't remember any of it.The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie. While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea, metaphors do not make a movie magically better. While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment, the movie cannot stand on it alone. I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its \"gimmick\" of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer. The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew. I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite, especially from the actors. If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you, but it is highly subjective and does not make the film \"the masterpiece of a century\". A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top. A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg.I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section. With a more likable poor family, lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story, this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been, but it would have been far more enjoyable for me. But thats okay, movies are not just made for me, a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie, so its current form definitely has a right to exist.\n",
      "Almost four years ago, South Korea's PARASITE made history by becoming the first movie not in the English language to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. That PARASITE would claim the Foreign Language prize was never in doubt. But winning the big Kahuna?? That was a different kettle of fish altogether. Only two other foreign films, Z and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, found themselves nominated in both categories, winning only for Foreign Language. And yet PARASITE won both!! Released to overwhelmingly favorable reviews in the spring of 2019, it gained far-reaching attention when it captured the Palme D'Or at Cannes. That victory was further capped by positive feedback at subsequent film festivals leading all the way to the year-end awards season.PARASITE was written by Bong Joon-ho, a Korean filmmaker whose resumé consisted of motion pictures that explored the dark side of übercapitalism. Bong's worldwide profile increased tenfold when he made SNOWPIERCER starring a distinguished international cast that included Captain America himself, Chris Evans, along with Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, and Korean leading man Song Kang-ho. A few years afterwards, Bong directed OKJA, a hybrid sci-fi/OLD YELLER story about a genetically enhanced porcine boasting yet another international cast.It was while filming the latter that Bong applied the finishing touches to PARASITE, which he claimed was inspired by at least two sources. The first was an obscure South Korean movie called THE HOUSEMAID about a middle class family whose lives are upended by the presence of a sexually provocative domestic servant. Another influence on PARASITE was the real-life case of the Papin sisters from 1930s France.PARASITE is about two families in present day Seoul who couldn't be more different from each other: the underprivileged Kims and the affluent Parks. The Kim clan live in a basement apartment where they have a wi-fi connection so lousy they sponge off the neighbor by standing in the bathtub to get a decent phone signal. They also endure neighborhood fumigations, stink bugs, and the daily, impossible-to-unsee sight of a wino urinating outside their window. With dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) unemployed, mom Chung-sook and daughter Ki-jung {aka Jessica} earn their keep folding pizza boxes. Their son Ki-woo {aka Kevin} is the most academically promising family member, but the Kims' low income status is destined to make his postsecondary education unfeasible.Kevin's friend Min is due to study abroad and casually suggests that he take over for him as an English language tutor for the adolescent daughter of the Park family. Min will be more than happy to vouch for Kevin, providing he's able to produce the proper credentials. Enter Jessica, who expertly photoshops a forged university certificate for her brother to present to the Park mother, a friendly yet gullible thirtysomething woman who, despite having a live-in housekeeper, finds maintaining the household a handful.The Park home is something I would describe as architectural eye candy, a two-story New Age mansion personally designed by the previous owner. Kevin feels understandably overwhelmed upon entering this domestic Utopia, but knows he must concentrate on the job at hand. His pupil is going through the usual teenage phase of becoming aware of her sexuality, while the preadolescent son obsesses over his belief that a ghost dwells within their house. Kevin suggests to Mrs Park that the boy needs to channel his energetic mind towards art therapy, telling her that he knows a friend of a friend that specializes in this form of psychology. Of course, he's referring to sister Jessica, but conceals the sibling relationship from his new employer.After googling the rudiments about art, Jessica is introduced to Mrs Park, and easily bluffs her way into employment. While being driven home in the family Mercedes Benz, Jessica schemes to oust the chauffeur by blithely removing her panties and strategically placing the undergarments beneath the driver's seat. The Parks, believing that he was using the vehicle for his sexual indiscretions, promptly fire him. Naturally, Jessica recommends a replacement....and here comes dear ol' dad Ki-taek.But usurping housekeeper Moon-gwang is going to be more problematic, however, because her tenure predates the Parks, going all the way back to the original architect owner. By being entrenched in the house for so long, she knows every nook and cranny inside and out better than anyone else. Doing a little bit of research, the Kims discover that her Achilles heel is a peach allergy, which the family of freeloaders shrewdly exploit to induce anaphylaxis....but imply tuberculosis. And guess who's waiting in the wings to replace Typhoid Moon? Yup, you got it!! Mom Chung-sook.So now the Kims ate sitting pretty enjoying someone else's opulent lifestyle....so long as they can sustain the deception. But the Parks' young son innocuously notices something amiss about them without really noticing it. Having an acute sense of smell, he nonchalantly comments how every one of their recent houseguests all seem to have the same odor....and yet they're supposed to be almost unknown to one another! Indeed, Mr Park readily admits that he refuses to ride in the subway because he doesn't want to ride amongst people carrying a lower-class stench on them.Luxury comes a-knocking for the Kims when the Parks pack up for an out-of-town camping trip. Left in charge of the house is the new live-in housekeeper Chung-sook, who secretly brings Ki-taek, Jessica, and Kevin over to temporarily live like royalty before their unwitting hosts return in a couple of days. But at the movie's halfway point, a plot twist occurs {which I will not divulge} that threatens to topple their carefully constructed house of cards.Bong Joon-ho takes pains not to pass judgment on the hard luck, yet opportunistic kinfolk, portraying them as flawed victims of an economic class disparity. To symbolize this inequality, Bong employs some clever visual touches. For example, when we see the Park family on the stairs of their elegantly modernistic suburbia, it's always when they're ascending, not descending. These shots illustrate their upward social mobility....as opposed to the other clan. In delineating the Kims' hardscrabble existence, the director repeatedly shows them in a declining stairway motion, serving as a metaphor for their bottom rung stature. Oddly, PARASITE found an unlikely admirer in North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who couldn't resist using the film to highlight the difference between the two Koreas, an example of the class warfare within his southern neighbor....and of capitalism overall.It's difficult to pin PARASITE down to any specific film genre. In promotional interviews, Bong described his movie as a comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains. Like a Coen Brothers picture, there's a magnificent wickedness on display in which we find ourselves snickering at situations we'd ordinarily be shocked and repulsed at in the real world. We understand the Kim family's need to seek a better life for themselves yet disapprove of their methods....even as we wind up laughing at some of them.Bong Joon-ho also took home Academy Awards for Director and Screenplay over such distinguished competition from Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Sam Mendes. Bong's triumph was certainly a dark horse, but, in retrospect, it really shouldn't have been. Over the past decade, Oscar's directing trophy has been truly international, with the recipients being French, Taiwanese, and especially Mexican. Just the previous year, Alfonso Cuarón won his second statuette in that category....for a movie not in the English language. Hopefully, PARASITE's victory will open up the eyes of mainstream audiences unused to reading subtitles at the bottom of the screen. To paraphrase Bogie, perhaps this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 🔚\n",
      "You will not get bored, you will enjoy most of it, but it does not get that level of a masterpiece!\n",
      "The west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment. This film is the example. A commercial, illogical potboiler with not one original character. This film can be compared to a number of Hollywood, European cinema. Everything is stupid and illogical. An entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity. Top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors?! And the owners of the house, a family of 4, has no clue about any of it, despite all these happening right under their noses for years? Sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical. Sounds like a Hollywood B comedy movie starring Queen Latheefa, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel and other SNL cast members.\n",
      "When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not \"good\" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain.\n",
      "One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better.\n",
      "Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!\n",
      "It was a disappointing. It was not bad. But it was to long. And the story starts strong and then the story changed from poor people to smart people and back to stupid people. The rich family didn.t do anything wrong. In my opinion you don't hated both families. So at the end i was thinking: Where is the rich family? I didn't get any connection with the poor family.\n",
      "Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me.\n",
      "I was looking forward to Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 Oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. Anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. There is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.But I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.The actors do a good job. It is watchable to kill time. Yes. Some scenes are fun. Yes. Some people claim it is one of the best movies of the decade. Really? For sure, it is NOT one of the best of the decade. It's not a bad movie by any means, just overrated.\n",
      "Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies.\n",
      "It sickens me that there are people voting this film down strictly because they feel the Academy was attempting to be \"woke\".Simply put, this is a stunning film that more than deserves every accolade it received and then some.I haven't felt so passionate about a film in quite some time and I truly feel we are witnessing an all time classic being bornBong Joon-ho delivered a masterpiece and we are privileged to see it. Kudos to the Academy for finally breaking the ridiculous void of not honoring any foreign language films for the top prize.\n",
      "This movie crowns all the relevant topics. Such a powerful combination of hatrid, detachment, irony. I dont see any eye opener, but an image from afar. Maybe an eye of the storm opener.\n",
      "Every reply is well studied and crafted, but the play is powerful and natural due to the high performance - play and sets.\n",
      "I ve found a very articulate speech, addressing topics like: global warming, Korean Reunification, the ... global enclavisation, the mistification of science, the blindness of the media (Park seemns to be involved with media or visual arts), the running from myths and fears (the ghost from the basement is a very complexe symbol), the dephts of the social construction - with it s double perspective (the rain as a disaster or entertainment).\n",
      "I ll watch this movie several times, because the building is equally robust and opened to zooming and nuances.\n",
      "The most, i admired the way it surpassed the cheap propaganda and obvious paths. No, this movie is for me a very complex essay on guilt and limits. Also, the tragedy dissolves in the web / the wave of infinite information.\n",
      "I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!\n",
      "Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time. Enjoyably thrilling.\n",
      "I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as \"perfection made film\".P.S. The house is a dream of architecture.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the opening scene of the boy, Ki Woo, taking the wrist of the girl, Da Hye, and taking her pulse to see if she could take the English exam. The scene in which the father and two sons escape from the villa, after locking the old carer and her husband in the basement, is beautiful. Now they are hit by an incessant rain like the worries of young Ki Woo. The father who, understanding the boy's state of mind, tries to relieve him of responsibility but this will not be enough. I didn't appreciate the generalization in representing people rich in money: poor at heart and foolish. I also failed to understand, due to my own lack of understanding, the meaning contained in the stone given as a gift by Ki Woo's friend to Ki Woo's family. The constant reminder of Ki Taek's bad smell triggered his anger due to his social condition and his lack of strength in reserving a different fate for his children.Pressures and unexpected events are always present and the way we react to them characterizes us, what is your plan?\n",
      "I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!\n",
      "Worst movie by far I have ever watched.\n",
      "Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring.\n",
      "How did this even got nominated...?\n",
      "How was this even released!???\n",
      "I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize.\n",
      "Don't waste a single second of your life watching that.\n",
      "The Parasite is nothing short of masterpiece, proof that asian directors are one of best in the world. It is also well acted. All actors did amazing job. The main theme is social classes. Some scenes, especially the evening when it rained, were devastating. But beside that I found family relationships to be very good represented.\n",
      "This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.\n",
      "Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience.\n",
      "High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain\n",
      "It's got attention through a Hollywood Event though it is a good film, quite cleverly done. It's quite violent ending takes you by surprise too. It's not worthy of 5 wins of course but not many people know what Korean films have to offer.I'm critical that The Farewell did not win anything then again the power of the Bollywood has neither had any proper reginition.\n",
      "I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!\n",
      "Actually until I watched the movie, I heard lots of good critics. It's wonderful, very impressive etc. But I don't agree, the first half of movie was good and also funny, but I can't say the same thing to other half, it wasnt realistic. And I reckon not as good as people standarts\n",
      "If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes.\n",
      "Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me.\n",
      "\"Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way\"\n",
      "Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending.\n",
      "I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019\n",
      "As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example \"Crossing the line\" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.\n",
      "You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker\n",
      "This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it.\n",
      "So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece\n",
      "This movie was alright. The acting was good and story was fine, but the pacing and the overall tone of the movie was kinda dull, imo. I wasent that invested in the plot and characters.\n",
      "There are better movies out there this year, like FordV Ferrari and The lighthouse.\n",
      "Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!\n",
      "It's not a bad movie and it has some great moments. But it's way too over hyped, like much award winning movies these days (insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino). You can tell it's a movie that wants to deliver a message; the problem is it's not quite clear what the message is.\n",
      "Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought \"Mother\" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece.\n",
      "When we were student in art faculty, our teachers use to say to us \"art or artist can't be unbiased, you pick a side and tell your story.\" I never agreed. This film approved I was right.\n",
      "I was looking forward to this movie all year, since i didn't like Roma (the international film front-runner and winner of 2018) as much as others did. This might just be the best foreign language film I have ever seen, with Portrait of a Lady on Fire (my personal favourite movie of the year) being one of the runner-ups.This film was a transcendent cinematic experience for me, as Bong Joon Ho, the director of the movie makes it seem like its a walk in the park to go through the different genres in film. Movies are my favorite form of art and Parasite is just that: The Definition of Art. Lets go #Bonghive 🍯\n",
      "Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.This says a lot about this one.Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later.\n",
      "Exceptionally written, ingeniously directed, and profoundly acted, PARASITE is a masterpiece of its own. This cleverly layered and twisted film is a social commentary about class division that seemingly tied into a perfectly paced and balanced multi genre that is packed with metaphors, implied messages, and symbols. PARASITE is an accomplishment for cinematic storytelling and world cinema that engross, surprise, and shocks.\n",
      "I love movies that criticize society and its different classes. This film combines humor and darkness and shows life from different perspectives. Love it!!\n",
      "The film was ok, I think a LOT of people tried to read into it too much and find way too much symbolism. It was ok for a movie to watch when you can't find anything else.\n",
      "So, I finally watched Parasite. While the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor, I still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the Oscars.For a best picture type of film I expect more: Top visuals, scenery, camera, sound effects, music, mixing, wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story. While those actors weren't especially bad, they were not great either. Especially the rich woman acted over the top.Now the story: For me this story was unfolding to easy, too cheap. At the start of the movie, the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors. There are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again. And there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves. The family in Parasite falls into the second category. They are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly. Nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs. Yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiy's home and those rich people (the father is a business man - so not a dumb person) aren't suspicious or realize that they are impostors (the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid???). Nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a driver's or a maid's job. Nope, they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours.The \"worst\" about the story: I could not sympathise with the poor family in the end. It was not like \"Yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement, they deserve better\". In contrary. Especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years, this parasite family does not connect with those people. They don't treat them better like they were treated before by richer people. They instead want to call the police. And when the former maid finds out that this family are impostors, she also does not connect with them, but tries to blackmail them.So the morale of the story is: Poor people are as bad as rich people and treat their kind with disrespect as well. In the end I had more sympathy with the rich family than with any of those impostors. It wasn't a story about \"from dish washer to millionaire\". It was a story about an unlikable, criminal family that in the end had no redeeming factors at all.\n",
      "It's a perfect movie in every way, words can't even decribe this satisfying feeling I got right now after I've seen it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that everybody need to experience. I can't even begin to describe it. Just watch it.\n",
      "It's not a bad movie. But maybe not for me? The story about poor family attaching themself to rich people like \"parasites\" is good. I realy liked first part of the movie but don't understand the dark turn in the second part. Ok so the Kim family lost themself but still they get evil a bit to fast. And the worst of all the party at the end. Why did the father Ki Taek killed Mr. Park? Because he was a bit selfish? Ki Taek just standed there doing nothing when his daughter was dying and his wife was fighting. Mr. Park just wanted keys to the car but for both his son and Ki Taek son. Sorry I know this movie have a lot of allusions and social commentaries but it's presented poorly for me.\n",
      "Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution.\n",
      "What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending.\n",
      "This is\n",
      "It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it.\n",
      "Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie.\n",
      "Just watch the damn movie its awesome...hollywood has had its ass kicked...story is so original\n",
      "The plots are refreshing and thrilling and the movie itself has one of the best paces I recently experienced in a movie.It was best described rollercoast slow ascendts and quik descents. I loved it!\n",
      "This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.Go see this movie.\n",
      "This whole film reminded me of \"10 clover field lane \" . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the \"parasite \" or someone is to you .Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone .\n",
      "Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies.\n",
      "I didn't find the movie so interesting. It felt like Mr. Bong was so confused about how to end the movie. The story ran so fast and the household shown was extra ordinary naive, which is also abnormal as a such big businessman.I couldn't break the 2 inch boundary of subtitle too. But this movie could be better.\n",
      "Parasite leaves a strong and lasting effect on viewers. It has surprising and funny story that turns out to be more than a life it self. Actually, it is a life, painted in all colors. In a film industry, Parasite is a Vincent van Gogh.The last movie that evoked so many strong emotions was Precious, in 2009.\n",
      "This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly \"tragic\". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale.\n",
      "The movie was really good! It's worth watching! The struggle of classes and the gap between them is visible in this movie, but all is is dressed with a lot of humor, unexpected events and a storyline and plot that won't let you down or make you feel bored at any moment!\n",
      "With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10\n",
      "This is not only the best film of 2019 but one of the best in the decades. The film does a wonderful job at crafting the story of the Kim family and their journey with the Parks. The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan. Even though this might be a foreign film for non-Korean audiences and you have to read subtitles, you have to look past that because once you do, you wont regret watching this marvel of a film.\n",
      "The way that this film respects its own characters is mind blowing. I really enjoyed watching this movie it's such a brilliant story with brilliant storytelling, it made me laugh cry and be scared in that order.. loved it, definitely gonna watch it again.\n",
      "Parasite is a movie where each element has the precise intended effect. Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant, and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot. If you haven't seen Parasite yet, I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it.The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite. On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably, while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims. The twist adds to the complexity of the situation - who's the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations? The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house. It's also an edge of your seat thriller where you're so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape. Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense. The comedy is an underrated element, as many scenes were very funny, especially the self-portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical. The acting was all excellent, and my two favorite performances were Jessica (the sister), who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor, and Mrs. Park, who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly. The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes, especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot, with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house, or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down, down, down. So many things to absolutely love about this movie that I could go on about, and nothing feels incomplete or not fully satisfying. Parasite is a genuine masterpiece.\n",
      "It's difficult to review a movie like this without revealing any spoilers. For real, you definitely want to avoid spoilers on this one. So, I'll just leave you with this.Parasite is an absolute must-watch movie for anyone who loves movies. You owe it to your life to watch the work of a master like Bong Joon-Ho at his very best.See it with a friend. Discuss it afterwards. Then see it again. You'll be glad you did.\n",
      "This film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece.\n",
      "'Parasite - an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.'When working-class Woo-sik Choi gets a job tutoring Sao-dam, the daughter of the rich Park family, so begins the slow, progressive attachment of the parasite to its host. This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches.\n",
      "A hard up Korean family slyly manipulate themselves into different jobs working for one wealthy family.The story takes an unexpected turn when a visitor arrives.This movie received a lot of good hype and it makes a social commentary. It's very well made but ultimately I did not really like the whole story being told. Not sure I would recommend.\n",
      "It's a good movie but really it's over rated. It is also little boring and slow\n",
      "I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days.\n",
      "Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.\n",
      "This movie completely surpassed my expectations. This is a stunning piece of cinema. I gave it a chance because of the incredible hype surround it and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very unique experience. The vast spectrum of genre covered in this movie is almost unheard of. It's artistic, irreverent, creative, beautiful, funny, shocking, violent, emotional, inspiring, and compelling. It holds the viewer throughout and it continually build atmosphere. The absolutely insane and unpredictable nature in how things unfold and escalate was so much fun. The fact that the movie could navigate so many genres successfully whilst balancing a consistent tone, maintaining the entertainment, and never becoming boring is a rare achievement. The movie keeps you guessing and and it crawls under your skin exactly like a parasite. The ending is a wonderfully beautiful touch to the story.I particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light, sound, and suspense to great effect.I cannot recommend this enough.GO. AND. WATCH. THIS. MOVIE.\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "Simply amazing! One of the best movies I watched in 2019. Keeps you on the edge all the way. Great flow. The end was something.\n",
      "All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing.\n",
      "I think this film is overrated. Not sure about all the coincidences happened to the family members are making sense.\n",
      "I was looking forward to watch some kind of survival thriller,that's what i thought from the title but it was completely different but still so convincing.It is a high quality movie and a must watch to understand the level of korean thrillers.After watching this movie only one word came iut of my mouth \"Brilliant\", and understood why it got 10 mins standing ovation at film festival 💥\n",
      "First off the Movie is absolutely ok, but i can't believe it won an oscar! I think it's a good example of todays influence by the media considering this huge hype and overinterpretation. At least the Movie is polarizing but it's far from a masterpiece - it's ok!\n",
      "I watched this movie because it won so many awards last year. About 1.5 hours in i got up and started playing on my computer... this movie wasted 2 hours of my life. Its nothing special and i think there are way better movies out there.\n",
      "Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie.\n",
      "In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the \"Oscar buzzy\" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic.\n",
      "Tigers every human emotionits hilarious\n",
      "its dark\n",
      "its original\n",
      "its powerful\n",
      "its thought provokingtime well spent\n",
      "This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.\n",
      "A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live.\n",
      "The scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy, and I loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner. The montage with the peach was also masterful, as was the way many scenes were filmed, styled, and handled. I loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them (temporarily).The young Kim family sister is an extremely talented actress, and so is the Parks pampered wife. The other actors were all solid as well. The story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities.The movie is never uninteresting. Even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so, it remains intriguing, but this is the only part that I felt that could have been a little bit better. I also had some questions about the incident at the Parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did.The suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes, and the humor was usually landing. The artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story. This is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the Oscars.\n",
      "Although I enjoyed watching the movie, I don't understand why people say this is one of the best movies of the decade. The ending is kinda weird and the middle of the movie is also boring\n",
      "Parasite received all sorts of rave reviews and the movie is really interesting until the part when they find out the housekeeper's husband is living under the house. Then it gets all whacked. And the son should have been killed by the force of trauma from the scholar stone that was supposed to be for good luck. Too many plot holes, like how could the family move back into that crappy apartment? Wasn't it condemned after all that flooding? Acting was superb but the violence at the boy's picnic was gratuitious and unnecessary. I'm sure some love this movie and want to see it again and again but it was rather dark and depressing. If you have a sick macabre sense of humor this film is for you!\n",
      "If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁\n",
      "The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The Academy has made a great decision on to laureate Parasite as Oscars' 2020 Best Original Screenplay, Best Film, Best Directing and Best Picture Awards. Besides having written a new chapter on Cinema's History as the first non-English-language movie to have gained this epic achievement, the Korean film is a timeless masterpiece, whose stylistics, cinematography, editing work, original screenplay and final outcome will be studied for decades and ever!Best Picture to Parasite!\n",
      "More than well-deserved!\n",
      "Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!\n",
      "Finally got around to watching this movie, even though being a long time Korean movie fan.Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway.It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies.Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO.\n",
      "A true masterpiece. I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film.\n",
      "This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it. I have watched much better movies both Western and Indian which portrays raw class, caste, religious and gender divide.\n",
      "I am still trying to figure out why would such meaningless movie get such a high ratings. There are thousands of films better than this but end up getting petty reviews.\n",
      "The plot is awesome. Bang jon hoo know how to portait. The background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience I have ever seen. Actors are perfect. Everyone must see, can be seen with family.\n",
      "Parasite is a thrilling, funny, surprising and satirical society. This is perfect film.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience.\n",
      "I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting.\n",
      "What a film.\n",
      "I was dying to watch this movie with a point like this but' it just doesn't deserve this score. If Inception is 8,6 this movie had a 7,5 with a good perspective. The movie got really meaningless every minute. It ended so ridiculous, \"Oh, I have a plan. Let's make us rich.\" Wow, why didn't you do that before? It can be enjoyed very hard but never gets this score.\n",
      "That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.\n",
      "Had to see what everyone was raving about and that it won best picture. Started ok but became tedious very quickly. No subplots, gave impression of gullible rich. Lacking imagination and poor ending. Yep it was okish\n",
      "Don't get all the fuss about this film, it is very average in every possible way. Started interesting but mid-way through it became boring and not compelling.\n",
      "It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing \"parasiting\" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer.\n",
      "I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.\n",
      "The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world.\n",
      "Saw this movie today after keeping it for shelves for 2 months......a reality in today's world...... acting was top notch. Don't have any words to explain the story. It's simple mind-blowing. Keeps you on hook till the end. One of the best korean movies of the last decade. Hopefully no one will remake it and spoil this classic\n",
      "Wow, just wow. This is one of the most perplexing films I have watched. I don't recall feeling so conflicted after a film since I watched Shutter Island. It's a fresh take on a common idea, and it is told in an unbelievablely beautiful manner. Everything about it was simply brilliant.This film is unlike any film you would watch these days. Rather than having a cliché \"good guy wins, bad guy loses\" theme, it actually makes you wonder: who is the good guy here? Who is the villain? It's been about half an hour since I finished this film and I'm still not sure who I'm meant to root with.\"Parasite\" starts as a light-hearted comedy about a poor family tricking a rich family into employing them, and it takes an exciting turn which will leave you on the edge of your seat.Then, a very dark plot twist occurs and the movie suddenly becomes scary and completely different to what you would expect from the first 30 minutes of watching. Just as you think the film would end in the next 10 minutes, it simply goes on and on, taking more and more turns along the way.I watched the film because of some of the reviews I read on here and I am very glad I did. If you haven't watched it then I would HIGHLY recommend it.\n",
      "This movie is so great . In my opinion , parasite is one of top 10 movies of the last decade .\n",
      "Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here.\n",
      "One of the best films of the decade... With an impressive cast and a talented and an critically acclaimed directed this movie delivers what it promises.\n",
      "Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..\n",
      "Can't believe it won both foreign and america best film.\n",
      "Some sloppy writing for instance. The Kim family is drunk in the Parrks home..All of a sudden they become sober. They throw glasses and bottles on the floor, then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it. When the two kids are under the ottoman hiding, theres no sign of broken anything. Also, the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years (why) and she's been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years. Then when she returns she can't open the secret door so the Kim family can see her. How did she manage all the years before this particular night. The film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed. Again, sloppy writing. The premise is good but the execution is bad. Oh, and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock. He recovers with nary a scratch. Again, poor writing. Movie makes no sense. On the plus side, the acting is good.\n",
      "So just lemme give a short review about points that make Parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century:1- It's a literal Dark Comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept that's actually thrown every where on media2- the economic gab wasn't about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politics/economy3- the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario4- \"best plans are those never existed\"5-no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if6- the end show the human's priority for 'survival'\n",
      "I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.\n",
      "This movie left me speechless. A true masterpiece. Really creative and innovative.\n",
      "Damn you south Korea. This is a top notch movie with high effective result. Storyline, acting, bgm and colour grading were so catchy. After watching this movie only one question is bouncing in my head, Who is the parasite ???\n",
      "It is definitely not a bad movie, but i feel like it is hyped up way too much.\n",
      "The acting seems a little over the top a lot of the time.\n",
      "The message is pretty clear, but that does not make the movie stand out.\n",
      "Nice movie to pass some time, but in my opinion nit the masterpice a lot of people make it out to be.\n",
      "Maybe I didn't get the message or maybe it's just not that good\n",
      "Repulsive story, highly prejudiced. The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation.\n",
      "Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices.\n",
      "Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious.\n",
      "I can say that i did not expect that how one movie could affected me like that.\n",
      "All i can this movie is speechless.\n",
      "This is so original & real.\n",
      "This is real life, i am so sad to see that how can poor people and capitalism world can do this to any human being... and also the ''smell''... the best version to explain that how people can feel low, terrible. and how rich people can consider any human being like their slave in modern world. only the system can do this. this film is real because its showing the real world, capitalism and how the poor people can fearless about any other human being in order to get money from them. its scary but its real. this movie shows that you cant trust anyone.\n",
      "Just WOW! What a movie I have just witnessed here! Thoroughly gripping right from the beginning to the end. My eyes were glued during the whole 132 minutes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie wins the Oscars for best picture. No criticisms whatsoever. A Must Watch for everyone out there!!\n",
      "Amazing Director\n",
      "Amazing cast\n",
      "Amazing performances\n",
      "One of the most mind blowing movies of the Decade\n",
      "Thank you Mr.Bong.Joon.Ho\n",
      "Finally watched the most talked film of the year, and now I realise why it is the most talked film of the year. Yes I'm talking about Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho. One of the best thrillers I've seen.\n",
      "Now talking about the story, it was going straight in the first half and was wickedly funny and then suddenly the twist arrives and it'll grip you edge of your seat. After that you can't move from that seat, and at last only sad.\n",
      "This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.\n",
      "At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says \"You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all \".\n",
      "The film's story was excellent and the characters the director tried to convey were great, but he didn't deserve a Best Picture award. Acting in the movie was good especially for the rich wife. The angle and camera were excellent and the director in the film was excellent. In conclusion the film was accepted\n",
      "The acting is great, humour is funny and the first half of the movie is so enjoyable, it has everything you want and is one of those that has you asking questions as to how the family can keep this going. Sadly ending of the movie just takes this film downhill way too fast and the final 20 minutes or so is just odd and disjointed. What happens to the wife, daughter and son who lived in the house? what about Min? Surely he returned from his travels? It's like the writer had the perfect idea all the way up to the killing off of characters and then didn't know how to tie up the loose ends. They instead just play on the political message about the gaps in wealth and class which is why I think this film appealed to the Oscar's.\n",
      "I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.\n",
      "Definitely the best movie of 2019. Everybody who loves cinema must see this film.\n",
      "WOW! I had no idea what to expect from this movie but it was fantastic! The acting was top-notch, there were laughs, dramatic moments, scary ones too. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Don't Miss this brilliant movie!\n",
      "When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art. The plot refelects human nature and what limits we are ready to cross in order to make ourselves secure and ignore our inhibitions no matter the cost. 2019 couldn't end any better....\n",
      "I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of \" memories of murder\", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.\n",
      "Movie was class. Like very class. If you know what i mean? This was so class, imagine Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. Class.\n",
      "Compelling characters, gripping plot, Parasite everything a movie should be. Stupefyingly unpredictable, it's remarkably refreshing and leaves you drop jawed at its conclusion.\n",
      "It's like the world, for the first time, found a box of Korean movies. Having never seen a Korean film they eagerly grabbed one off the top and watched it, and said, 'oh my God, this is the best thing ever'. My advice is to keep digging in that box. There's a lot more that are a lot better in there.\n",
      "Parasite is a one of the kind film, analyzing the relationships of power between people, social and economic classes and also between genres. The director was capable of camouflage such critics even within the urban landscape, creating political and social spaces that differ and are affected differently. There are subtle nuances of how climatic circumstances are seen and felt by the different spectrums of social classes. Parasite's narrative and visual language achieves a tremendous sensation on the spectator, a sensation of social verticality.\n",
      "I watched \"Parasite\" a Korean film last night. I have been hearing how great this movie is and how IMDB rating is 8.5 IGN 9.5 Rotten Tomatoes giving it 100%. Well, am I missing something? I do think it's a good film but almost a perfect 10 I don't feel that. The actions of the main family seems so realist. The story, the way it's written, and just the performance of the actors is good. You can imagine that something like this can maybe happen to people that is just gullible. But I felt like everything was very predictable. But some questions were unanswered Like, Why was the original house keeper (Moon-gwang) face messed up? Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off? I do like the Director (Joon-ho Bong) and other films he had made but I just feel like this movie is more a 6.5 / 7 for me.\n",
      "Over hyped nonsense. Too long and I didn't care what happened to characters. Needed to be a short film and im being generous. Although i thought the 3 dogs were better actors.\n",
      "This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once. Makes you question about right and wrong in a unique way.\n",
      "But it has also a darker side that makes you feel overwhelmed apart from the story itself. It may be the coloring of the movie.\n",
      "It's weird watching foreign films because you aren't always sure if you're watching a good performance or not. But in this film you don't have to question. The movie starts out intriguing for the first hour or so then becomes exhaustingly exhilarating. The entire last hour is a nonstop thrill ride, for lack of a better cliche.\n",
      "Parasite is also a person who uses others to obtain advantage without doing anything in exchange . parasite is about poor family who are trying to get job in rich families home ,the son (kim ki woo ) is english tutor and his sister (ki jung ) art therapist and their parents mother (chung sook ) housekeeper and father (ki-taek) is driver . they are poor family but want to get rich so they fool park family to get this job. parasite is a success story and also winning everyone's heart ,it is also a top prize cannes film festival and best foreign film in golden globes. director bong joon ho is his seventh film and its too good . this movie told us about the ugly , brutal modern life . when someone lives out in the open and others are forced to live in shadow but everyone sucking one another's blood. this movie of director boong joon ho called it \"satirical black comedy thriller movie\"so parasite is stunning movie and all characters are wonderful actors.\n",

      "'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body\n",
      "What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances.Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them.kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members.the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making.One evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo. Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -wooMrs. Park's son da - song\n",
      "He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing\n",
      "Ki-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she's not one of these and she also enters the house.Kim ki - taek tells his family \"rich people are realy gullible\"\n",
      "The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper. Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to work\n",
      "It is here that the name of the film becomes a make senseKim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthday\n",
      "Kim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to Park\n",
      "Suddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives.\n",
      "If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film.Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone.Kang ho song's performance as ki - taek is subtle.The acting of kang's physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable.\n",
      "The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause.\n",
      "(example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB.\n",
      "the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)\n",
      "The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge.\n",
      "Thrilling and epic film, you wouldn't avoid feel overwhelmed of sensations watching this movie. I'm very surprised\n",
      "I enjoyed this film but I don't think it's the masterpiece that critics have made it out to be. I didn't get the numerous multiple genres from this that others have claimed it has. It's effectively a crime flick with a poor family conning a rich family with some social commentary thrown in. I suppose the ending is a bit more thriller/horror.The story is entertaining enough, some of the imagery is lovely and it's well acted. See it but don't expect it to be the best film of the year.\n",
      "Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!\n",
      "Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by. I had only heard good things going in, but nothing of the actual plot points. I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo's friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park's house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias \"Kevin\" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song's artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song's art therapist.Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park's Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim's present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim's settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim's fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they're all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song's birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park's residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park's call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don't find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.Overall, Parasite gets a 10.\n",

It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it\n",
      "You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie with all the twists and turns and surprises. It's worth watching and there is not a dull moment in it. I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year.I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive. The poor people are conniving criminals willing to take what is not theirs, or cheat and lie if given the opportunity.Watch to be entertained. That's it. Don't read anything into it.\n",

      "All I wish to say is do not go by the rating or the hype. It is an average movie but with a slightly better storyline. There are way too many movies which are much much better.\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !\n",
      "Avoid spoilers\n",
      "If you like Asian cinema and are curious about which movie to see before tonight's oscar ceremony then this movie is a must see. Despite being a Korean movie with subs it has a lot of excitement and drama to make it an upset at tonight's telecast.\n",
      "Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. This film is a milestone for Korean cinema. Just watch this with your own eyes. I can bet you will never forget this. I have never seen a film where one can present the deeply rooted social class boundaries not just in Asian countries but all over the world in such an entertaining and engaging way.\"You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\"\n",
      "The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews.\n",
      "Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed.\n",

      "This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth.\n",
      "The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood.\n",
      "Everybody must watch this movie.\n",
      "Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time.\n",
      "Unquestionably the best movie of the year and the best foreign movie I've ever seen. A complete rollercoaster ride . Laughter, anxiety and sadness, felt all in 2 hours. Cinematography was amazing specially for the flood secenes. Memories of murder was one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen and Boon Joon-Ho has managed to make another masterpiece.\n",
      "Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering.\n",
      "Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure.\n",
      "For shure it's a good movie.\n",
      "The production is great ( visual, audio, cut).\n",
      "But the story started great and end up a little flat.\n",
      "Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper.\n",
      "Palme d'Or winner Parasite is a masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. That movie is so skilled. Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job. Actually I can't find any bad things to say about Parasite. It is great.\n",
      "Long before Parasite ended (I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish) I had diagnosed Bong Joon-ho with ADHD. The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story: slapstick, hard-hitting social commentary, mystery, comedy of manners, tear-jerker or thriller.There's a lot of good acting, but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character's situation. It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago, where every production had to cover all the bases: romance, crime, thrilling chases, and lots of hilarious (well, meant meant to be hilarious) comic relief. This wasn't as much fun. At the end, I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale, but I was very happy. I only rented the film.\n",
      "Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing.\n",
      "First off the film is half and hour too long, most of the dialogue is simplistic and repetitive. how it won best screenplay is beyond me. the film has no heart or soul, we do not care for the poor family, as they are all self serving, uninteresting and as the title says parasites. they go from bumbling incompetents to master con artists, as other have pointed out the rich family are presented as really stupid, unaware of what is happening around them. the ending was just silly and implausible, mind you most of the film was like that. like shape of water, roma and others the film seems to have hoodwinked critics and audiences alike into believing that this is some form of great social comment and insight. IT IS NOT whilst it is good that a film from Korea has won the plaudits this has, it is also very indicative of the times that everyone has read into the film, when really what they are seeing is just not there\n",
      "This is a great Korean little gem. The storyline is simply amazing and I suggest not read anything before you watch it. I did it and I have enjoyed every single minute of the movie. Best plan is not having one.\n",
      "This time I watched it in theatre with very annoying crowd. They laughed all the time but the reaction to second half of the movies was priceless (everyone was like wtf is happening). Oscars not nominating Kang-ho Song for best supporting actor is a disgrace.\n",
      "Also, it deserved at least cinematography nomination but whatever.\n",
      "I'll keep this brief. This film is best enjoyed sans spoilers. Stellar cast-not one weak performance in this film. Superbly done.\n",
      "As Jordan Peele is to race, Bong Joon-ho is to class. He creates strange, shocking scenes and stories from the seemingly mundane. A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic.\n",
      "This is a very good movie, but not a masterpiece. I really like the story and the actors were pretty good. I would never expect this film to win an Oscar. I guess the politics has entered the Oscars for good.\n",

      "So much for originality.\n",
      "Though you're fooled by a different message of the have and have nots. Which confused me even more. They spent so very little time allowing the family to integrate themselves as \"the rich\" which is how it was sold.\n",
      "Any way, the message also backfired, considering how despicable the \"poor family\" behaves. The only rationale is that they are so desperate, their actions are forgivable. No, the ends doesn't justify the means. It becomes even MORE muddled when we see the future life that is the possibility, never mind the supposed Morse code feature works only one direction. So if the son is writing a letter to the father, he can't get it. Or maybe we're to assume he left it somewhere where he'd find it. Too many damn questions.SPOILERS!!! Stop reading if you are going to see:I dunno, it's shot well, and it's funny, but there are just questions. As one reviewer had put it \"why do they make dumb decisions?\" Are they trying to say that poor people are dumb? Also, when the old housekeeper comes back, why don't they just join forces? The entire thing was unnecessary and aggravating. Also, what was the end game? To kill the rich people and assume their lives? And the fact that poor Dad snaps and attacks the rich Dad over a stench poor people have? Delaying the bleed out death of his daughter?\n",

      "The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society.\n",
      "Just the rest of the world, and the academy, catching up with what my husband and I have known for years: Korean writers are absolute masters at plot twists and characterization! If you don't agree, watch a few more Korean movies to get adjusted to the cultural differences, and you'll see.\n",
      "This movie did resonate with its audience, it did get critical acclaim, it did win a bunch of awards, but then, guess what, I reckon I'm the edgy, white person who starts saying it's idiotic and/or overrated. I think that the primary Oscar should have gone to The Irishman, or Once upon a time... In Hollywood, or\n",
      "1917 (Nineteen seventeen), or Mr. Jones, or Dark waters, or\n",
      "The lighthouse, or Sorry we missed you, or Richard Jewell\n",
      "Glass, or even Downton Abbey - the motion picture. The ACademy likes to give out Oscars to movies that push the \"correct\" political opinion. This has nothing to do with the so-called 7th art anymore.\n",
      "I am sorry, I didn't like it...It could have been great, the topics were valid, but it was just not good. I don't think it was a masterpiece, at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point.\n",
      "The story was not good either.\n",
      "I have to disagree with the rest of the world.\n",
      "Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think \"masterpiece\" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon.\n",
      "This film had me hooked from the beginning. A fast-paced, and well thought out storyline. No details were left unanswered in my eyes. Brilliant and humble acting from all the cast with believable characteristics and flaws. The subtitles throughout are worth it for what is unveiled during the film.\n",
      "This film is such a perfect masterpiece in every facet that one cannot be but astounded and has become interested in everything Korean. I am in love with Korean language, with its sweet words-enunciation, the cadence, the soft and musical ending of every sentence. However,the less one read about the movie beforevwatchng it, the better. Go and see it, you won't regret\n",
      "This film is a masterpiece, a cinematic slap. Parasite is cinematic perfection. It's not just my favourite film of the year, it's in my top 5 of my best movies of the last decade. Just when you think you know what type of movie it is, it suddenly becomes a completely different movie when you least expect it. Crazy, funny, incredibly smart. I loved it. I've tried to keep my review to a minimum because the less said about this movie the better, everyone needs to see this movie !\n",
      "Comparing the nominees, this movie is surely not an Oscar wining movie. Ahhhh but Hollywood has something else in their mind.\n",
      "Anyways, a good watch though, unique story about the class difference.\n",
      "The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - \"Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?\". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!\n",
      "What ever brought this movie its Palm and its Oscar, I couldn't find it on the screen, and no I am not offended, neither by its story nor its violence.\n",
      "Try to catch Harold Pinters/Joseph Losey's The Servant (1963) starring Dirk Bogarde and you'll Se a similar theme screened in perfection, with better actors and a much better camera work.\n",
      "Sorry,\n",
      "Why this won best picture I will never know. The translation was horrible. Plot filled with holes, and so so acting.\n",
      "A true masterpiece, 10/10! I don't think I will get to watch a better movie soon!\n",
      "Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!\n",
      "Good: all the actors, most of the acting and directing, hearing the beauty of the spoken Korean language, the sets (in particular, the first floor and yard of the award winning Namgoong Hyeonja designed house), the cinematography and the first half of the film.\n",
      "Bad: the second half of the film.\n",
      "Ugly: the overflowing toilet.The first half of the movie was magical. The storyline and setup were unique, credible and crisp. Then, it all fell apart. The punchline was a low blow at best. Too many pratfalls, way too surreal, overly silly and sadly pretentious. As a member of the (target?) audience I felt cheated. It should have been so much more and could have been with very little tweaking and tightening. Bottom Line: Parasite does not deserve the Best Picture Award or the Best Director Award from the Academy, period.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy.\n",
      "The entire basement characters arc felt almost dissatisfying just existing. This includes everything from the tacked on morse code shenanigans, to the being held hostage by a damn camera phone. I really would love to watch a version of this movie's plot where the basement just doesn't exist, and focus on the 2 primary families intriguing plot line.\n",
      "It's overrated, it doesn't deserve to be in 250 at all, nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6. There is no point, the first few minutes are funny, then predictable. You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it's on 250, but nothing happens. It is entertaining a bit\n",
      "Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent moviesIn my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottomThe movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.Sad open ended finale.Highly recommend\n",
      "Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making.\n",
      "Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!\n",
      "One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises.\n",
      "The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone.\n",
      "Satirical, metaphorical, genius, paradoxical, impulsive, genuine; watch this movie!!!!\n",
      "It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography.\n",
      "Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage.\n",
      "This 2019 crime-drama tells of a needy, Asian family that sneaks their way into a wealthy businessman's home by pretending to be hired help and after one of their children tutors his daughter. Things go well at first, but take a drastic turn effecting everyone involved. This is a pretty good film with a bit of humorous, tense and dramatic moments. Give this one a try if you enjoy Foreign or crime\n",
      "films.\n",
      "I have been watching (and trying to watch) Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police/authorities hilariously incompetent. Both of which (no surprise) showed up in this film. They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism.The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar.The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?Everything about this movie is frustrating, it's like watching 90s hollywood action flick. All emotions, no realism.\n",
      "This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece\n",
      "We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.\n",
      "Great, Masterpiece.\n",
      "This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, \"PARASITE\" onto you, rich or poor.\n",
      "At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a while, it has a message that you have to look in another perspectives to look in a different ways from the poor families and the rich family, and that doesn't mean they are rich they don't look after for the poor families, but the greediness and the hatred between the two poor families, show us how is the innocent family is.\"Spoiler \"\n",
      "The greedy between two Poor families that caused climax of Antagonism. The poor families because of the greediness and hatred the \"rich family\" and Innocent family has suffered, and caused a death to the rich family.\n",
      "Parasite is unique and manically engaging with humour, it doesn't all work though.Another reviewer captured it right, in saying it's lacking of human spirit. Unlike that person I like the film, but I do agree with that. Yeo-jeong Jo's good as the house wife, but the Kim Ki-Jung character's ineffective and her mother unlikable. I don't buy that Kim Ki-taek and Kim Chung-sook could actually fill these job roles at this time, more so the mother. Plus the guy living in the basement and the Morse code, quite stupid and the resolution well it's weak. It's obvious the father will be in the basement, after fleeing the incident and Kim Ki-woo just isn't going to go from the slums to earning enough money to buy this place.\n",
      "Whoever calls it a masterpiece just don't know meaning of masterpiece at all. I don't understand how this movie got oscar. It's just very normal average movie. Too much hype for this average movie.\n",
      "Great movie with likable characters. There were a lot of surprises. I was really rooting for them to succeed and couldn't believe how some things turned out. I was somewhat disappointed how it took a turn for the worse in the movie. Definitely shocking.\n",
      "NEVER seen a movie like this. Wow what a masterpiece! Twist after twist, it had it ALL!!!\n",
      "The Korean drama and thriller written & directed by Bong Jong Ho is truly a masterpiece. It is entruguing thriller. And every bit of the screenplay keeps you in the movie till the end... Outstanding work of modern art\n",
      "I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10\n",
      "Great story! Beautiful film\n",
      "Great acting.Make sure to plan just don't go with the flow.father waits...but not sure how long.Watch it on 4K, Oled.\n",
      "Only mild spoilers.If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the \"monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted \"The Artist\" the \"foreign acknowledgement Best Picture\" a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance(8)\n",
      "I think it's fair to point out that this film goes off the rails at the end. I'm not sure why the director thought it needed a big climactic ending. It's a pet peeve of mine when a writer can't think of any other way to close a character arc or plotline then to literally kill off characters who no longer serve a purpose. The finale here feels forced and out of place considering how methodical and slow-burning the first hundred and twenty minutes were. When your themes are so simple and messages so obvious, plot and characters are all you've really got to hang your hat on. And in Parasite it falls flat.And for those snobs who accuse everyone who finds any fault with this movie as some cinematically-illiterate fool who only watches Hollywood blockbusters, I think The Servant (1963) handled this same basic plot with more nuance and emotional impact.\n",
      "An intricate depiction of the society classes forming in every modern society around the world. Rightfully asking the question: \"Who is living of whom?\" It is filled to the brim with metaphors examining the cultural clashes between two very different families from vastly different social standings, headlined by a very strong script and fleshed out characters. Furthermore, it has amazing cinematography with some creative editing choices, great sets and the shot selections are flawless.\n",
      "It's a \"lyrical comedy\" film (which means it's not funny, but you are not supposed to cry over the misfortunes either) with a dramatic story. To put it simply it's a \"slice of scam\" movie.It's a bit weird in looking \"more\" than its subject matter, but it's not pretentious. All the film-students-never-film-workers and the so-called \"movie\" \"critics\" tried their hardest to make you think this is some indie art-house mumblecore drama about gay-cowboys eating pudding, and oscars are always a \"black spot\" for the movies, but in the end this is an alright watch. And it will leave you with nothing, just like all the average films.\n",
      "I really do not know how is it rated over 8. Too many plot holes, too much drama and lack of build-up make this film very hard to watch. Is it rated that high because the majority of voters are Korean? A waste of time.\n",
      "If you want to see why this move took the Oscars, you should check it and give it a try. Maybe you would like or not. Just watch it!Yes, the metacritic score it's really high for this movie. But yeah, it's a \"must see\" movie. The soundtrack used in this movie is fantastic!The acting was great, from my point of view.If want to see a drama movie with a little few scenes of comedy, a \"dark comedy\" you should try it. Trust me, you won't lose anything.\n",
      "The movie 'parasite' was harrowing. Greed and envy - thats what it is about. Lying, cheating family traits, inflicting these lies on a kind family who employs them. First the son - lies about his tutoring qualifications and he cheats his way into manipulating the underage daughter he is tutoring. Through further subterfuge, his sister, father and mother all end up working for the family. Unbeknownst to them, the family of lying 'good for nothings' have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees, they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown.Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them? I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next. If enterprise and cunning got this family into employment, why were these skills not used for employment from lawful means?\n",
      "The story is skillfully told but it is still a horrible story. There was little justice in the end, so it does make you regret watching it.\n",
      "After 6th watch I think I got all little details and all messages. I really love the climate change/rain message. He changes genres so smoothly and never bored me once on my 3rd watch in last week and a half. I just gotta say Bravo Bong!!!\n",
      "The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda; specifically, the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world. The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the \"If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?\" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality.\n",
      "Its a little overrated. 7.5/10. Not bad not so good.\n",
      "A great film that really has a bit of everything in it. It starts off funny as they infiltrate the household before turning into a thoughtful look at the gap between the richest and poorest in society, and ultimately ends up as a bloodbath and rather sad. The social commentary is topical, the plot has some good surprises along the way, and the arty style and use of music makes it a very interesting film to watch.\n",
      "This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this.\n",
      "Full Star ratings would seem off had this movie not been such a well written roller coaster of events, this movie has moments that are as thrilling and terrifying as S. Kings Misery. This movie is realistic and immersive, simply a must watch film, with lots of hard work and time put into it, unforgettable.\n",
      "'Parasite', this year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or, is so many things - tiptoeing different genres, exploring themes of family, work, inequality, and the class divide - rolled into one thoroughly wild, exciting, hilarious, dark, tragic, and unpredictable film.Honestly, I can only sum it up in the wise words spoken by one of the characters: THIS. IS. SO. METAPHORICAL.\n",
      "I thought that this was definetly one generic movie (everything nice-something happens- that situation is solved) but it was not. I was amazed by the expression that the director has put on this film. Very nice original story and graphism.\n",
      "I would recommend everyone to watch this.\n",
      "This movie truly deserved the oscar.\n",
      "Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner.\n",
      "Best movie in 2019 really it fantastic I really enjoyed and loved a actors and I feeled I was lived with them that is the first Korea move I ever watch\n",
      "I rate the film for its intention, for its rawness, and for the impression it leaves after I walk out of the cinema.\n",
      "Nevertheless, I don't feel convinced by the acting, nor the somewhat implausible story line.\n",
      "I can watch this film as a well-packaged piece of entertainment. But I don't think I'd be missing much, if I hadn't watched it.\n",
      "Course after all the fuss about this winning best picture I had to see what it was all about! Surprisingly funny and depressing all in one go..... the end really got dark... loved it.\n",
      "There are 100s of movies worth better, never reached the oscars. You can watch it maybe once or twice but definitely won't keep it in your collections. Well executed and it is been overrated for it\n",
      ".\n",
      "One of the great time waster of all times , this movie never fulfilled the expectations , the reason why I wasted my time on this movie coz of Oscars but I never find anything special in this movie , many hundred movies must be rated much higher than this movie.\n",
      "Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical.\n",
      "It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it.\n",
      "10/10 + Oscar\n",
      "Not perfect, but it's brilliant in many ways. The director should be awarded.\n",
      "Utterly bonkers at times but always brilliant something completely fresh for the first time in a long while. Loved every second couldn't take my eyes off the screen words can not justify just how great this film was other than films this good and this original really don't come around very often. Truly riveting and a true joy to watch.\n",
      "Had a free screening at our campus. What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point, but it seems to have compassion for every party involved, no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them. This is way different than current day films, such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the 'villains'. I wonder if it's the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy.\n",
      "I never write reviews but this film was a masterpiece! Definitely one of my favorite movies now. Go watch it, you won't regret it!\n",
      "Believe the hype. This is one of the best if not the best film in years. Watch it and you'll see why\n",
      "OK so after years i finally succeed to convince my wife to watch this film with me for the first time both.I had heard all the hype, the Palme d'or, tje oscar etc.. that i was conviction this movie was going to be exceptionnal.During the first hour i had that feeling that everything i thought was going to happen, happened. I was skeptical because i thought something special, subtle, inexepected, original. But not at all. Everything expected happen. The boy hired, the girl hired, the father, the mother. Not even with some big originality.Suddenly i must say the basement thing. OK we're going somewhere different but for what ? Even this idea is not really going deeper.Some tallk about class fighting. Rich vs poor ? Really this thing so.. already seen. With a family of poor people almost sociopath ? We dont root for them, as we dont root for the rich either (questionnable..).The only thing i like was the last scene. The boy responding to his father that he will become rich and buy the house. And as all plans do go well we can think that it will never happen and the father will surely die in the basement. And with (good?) reason.Bref. All that for that. Not worth an Oscar for a long shot. Hollywood and cinema world love themselves too much to make us believe what they think is great is. Let's not be fooled.\n",
      "For sure the best movie I've seen of 2019. Nothing holds a candle to it.\n",
      "Okay, so these slightly over two hours are \"Parasite\" or \"Gisaengchung\", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now.\n",
      "So the movie won an oscar, was claimed to be a masterpiece and so on. Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated.Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like \"Oh wow, that was amazing!\". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this.The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar.\n",
      "Less subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations.\n",
      "Its not often I go to see subtitled films but given the reviews I thought and I had to see this one and I am so glad I did.It's fantastically different and a great story that really draws you in but never stops surprising you with a laugh or shock around every corner.A great film and well worth anyone's time to go and see it.\n",
      "After watching the film I continued to run the film through my mind. The way the writers put subtle flashes to in your face current social climate issues was probably one of my favorite things about the film. Like other reviews I agree that it's almost two films in one. You will leave with internal questions and possibilities of different ending that could happen.\n",
      "Been some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema.\n",
      "People can be parasites is what is it about this film and have lots of messages!\n",
      "I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.\n",
      "Something new, but confusing, at times boring, not funny, off tone, off performance, makes this a 3\n",
      "A very strange movie. Not sure if I loved or hated it more. The acting was good but I did not get the purpose or morale of the story line. Well maybe there was none and I am just thinking too much.\n",
      "This movie is not a horror movie not a suspense movie but I was just on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The tense string of relationships that hold all of the characters together... More thrilling than a thriller, more suspenseful than a suspense movie, More guessing than a murder mystery. It takes the typical human reaction to the next level. Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other. Entertaining as well as stab you in the stomach deeply with a moral sword to see how you feel. A masterpiece  with your morals as well as your feelings for justice.\n",
      "What does this movie want to tell us?\n",
      "That the people living at the bottom have a tough life?\n",
      "That these people are evil and shameless?\n",
      "That they are continue to be like this as if THEY are the heroes?\n",
      "I can't believe this movie won 4 Oscars!\n",
      "You know a movie is good when there's been two months since you saw it and you're still thinking about it. I've enjoyed Bong Joon Ho's previews work but I wanted to enter the cinema with with a clear mind and no expectations. And I was shocked. The movie, every aspect of it, is perfect, from music to script everything was just beautiful. Easy best movie of the year and one of the best of this decade.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film.\n",
      ".\n",
      "In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Where to begin on how great of a film \"Parasite\" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where \"Parasite\" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see.\n",
      "It's just Fantastically Fabulous Masterpiece shown in the most creative way as possible..The content is so unique, never seen before..so creative, suspenseful ...Hats off to the makers, they're at the best of movie work!!\n",
      "People need to watch this!!!!\n",
      "Simply Amazing. The movie has a little bit of everything. One of the best films I've seen.\n",
      "Parasite is good movie of the year. What a story plot and execution was so nice.\n",
      "The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings *as if* they have soul. This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths.The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves.\n",
      "Best Movie 2020 . Sure Shot Oscar In every Compition . Worth watching .\n",
      "The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is \"Parasite\" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year.\n",
      "One of the greatest films I have ever seen\n",
      "The movie directing and the inferences that the director used to direct the film were very genius\n",
      "The acting performance is great\n",
      "Worth winning an Oscar for Best Foreign Film\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020.\n",
      "This is quite a tour de force, scooping up all the prizes in this award season (so far). It begins as a comedy of circumstance but takes a decided turn into some unexpected genres. The story is surprising and multi-layered. Your allegiances will shift throughout. The acting is superb. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Comedy, Thriller, Drama}\n",
      "Ok ok, I've got to give it to the filmmakers that this unusual film is beautiful shot & acted. But for me, it was also a disheartening mess, taking dreadful closterphobic turns as it descended into the depths.\n",
      "In some ways its kinda scary and its because you never know who you think you know. Also, this movie in some ways reminds me of Sweenie Todd and The Family in one. Anyway, better than both and is a must watch!\n",
      "This movie grabbed my interest immediately and never let go. well-made all around. a memorable experience. (1 viewing, 2/15/2020)\n",
      "Story line is good but not something new. Screen play little slow at times. Acting is not that great.\n",
      "It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time.\n",
      "My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it! It's about a family that lives in a little house that want better things. Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography, writing, production design, and captivating characters! Well deserving of the awards/nominations; unfortunate people didn't like the movie.\n",
      "This is the best movie of 2019, over.\n",
      "RESPECT, over.\n",
      "(Flash Review)WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder.\n",
      "10/10 - undoubtedly original and captivating...this is why we go to the cinema\n",
      "No doubt this was a great film with a strong plot but not that awesome to win an Oscar award - otherwise this film is definitely worth that watch showing some humor and suspense.\n",
      "A meticulously crafted & confidently narrated black comedy thriller that offers a biting take on the socio-economic state of modern South Korea, while also taking a jab at late capitalism, the 2019 Palme d'Or winner is Bong Joon-ho's most mature & accomplished film to date that finds the distinguished filmmaker at the apex of his craft, and further cements his position as one of the brightest storytellers of our generation.\n",
      "I can understand there are a lot of people who really enjoyed the movie. It has good pace, there's a lot of tension and some unexpected twists. But honestly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece, despite it flaws. And it has many flaws, unfortunetly most of them are in the story itself. For me they spoiled the movie. I was asking myself questions almost from the beginning of the story:\n",
      "Why a smart, young, good looking, english speaking guy cannot find at least decent job?\n",
      "How his sister, without experience or art/psychological education manages to conduct tutoring to the boy, with whom - as his mother said, couldn't stand any art teacher? First lesson we can see even the boy bowing to \"Jessica\" - did she hipnotize him or smth?\n",
      "How she knew about trauma the boy had?\n",
      "The fathee could drive modern, expensive car without proper experience or training. They were poor, so he does not drive at all, and as he said his only experience with merces cars were during short work as a parking worker. How he could play experienced driver?\n",
      "How it is possible a woman without proper experience knows how to run modern house and how to behave as a housekeeper for a rich family? And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes, while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation?\n",
      "There is a scene with the Da-Song sitting in a tipi, writing the message of \"HELP\" that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp. The movie never addresses that later. Why the boy did not inform parents about that. And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp, and strange patterns of the flashing light?\n",
      "How it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years????\n",
      "There are just some of the questions I had. Main two ones are: why a family of so resourceful, inteligent and determined people live in a basement in a poorest of districts? With their talents they should be or on the top or in prison. Second - ending suggests we should sympatize with a father and his son. I have no idea how we can do that - they cheated, murdered and caused some innecent people to lose their jobs and reputation - honestly, there were no people in the movie I would like or had any sympathy for.\n",
      "The fact that there are such a ridiculous number of 10/10 reviews proves most of them are not genuine. Who cares about the \"clever\" metaphors when a movie just fizzles out into an absurd and unbelievable nonsense conclusion.\n",
      "This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.\n",
      "Didn't have to time to watch before the Oscars. Just have and all awards duly deserved (even if there had been better competition). A movie to leave you speechless. It really is that good.\n",
      "I can't get enough of it. I watched it second time and it is even better than first time and first time was like amazing amazing.\n",
      "Probably the best movie of this year. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. Acting is so natural and trailer didn't reveal anything to me and I'm grateful for that. This is another Korean masterpiece and it reminds me a little of Oldboy. It is shame that I had to watch it online because they aren't showing it in my cinema.\n",
      "If you must make a home invasion movie do it as a comedy and not as a horror film, right? Bong Joon Ho's \"Parasite\" arrives already festooned with awards and rightly so. In this gem a family of low-life con-artists manage to take over the home and lives of a softer and much richer family that in some ways mirror them. It's like \"Us\" but without the supernatural element. Of course, a scheme like theirs can't succeed without something going very wrong which, of course, it does turning \"Parasite\" beautifully and brilliantly into the blackest of comedy-thrillers that does finally manage to erupt into just the kind of horror flic we expected from the start.With pitch-perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year, not to mention the kind of home any family would be happy to invade, this is an instant classic. I can already see the American remake but it will never top this. It may not be quite as profound as it would like to be but for sheer cleverness it's up there with the very best.\n",
      "Did i just watched a different movie ? I don't Know after reading all reviews i was quite excited and had hopes on this film. The overall concept of this film is good but definitely overrated i watched many films better than this which the critics and audience failed to appreciate. But this one is not up to the hype that the critics .\n",
      "Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!\n",
      "Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit through. Despicable characters, a drawn out storyline, and annoying dialogue made the enjoyable act of movie watching a chore.\n",
      "But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended.\n",
      "I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards!\n",
      "A MUST WATCH!\n",
      "A must watch .. mesmerising with mixed overwhelming feelings throughout the two hours.. it doesn't leave you after it ends; you cannot help but continue think of what if!\n",
      "\"A waterproof toy tent, and a semi-basement house that got flooded\"\n",
      "Parasite is one of the most original creative films I have seen in many years. Its tense, funny, heart warming, shocking, all in one film. The acting, and writing is absolute top notch. I can not recommend this movie enough.\n",
      "I didn't feel their was enough buildup to justify the abrupt criminal act at the end of the movie. Felt contrived and forced.\n",
      "It's a nice-to-watch movie and nice-to-think afterwards of what you've just saw.At first, it feels you are watching a single-sided comedy, in which a family of poor-devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people. But, 45 minutes later, you see something different.It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene, trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is ok.The ending is not the best I could think of, I guess, rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming.Very strong and meaningful pictures, painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world, showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere. The main characters is like they're living in North Korea if you think of it!Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil, nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that make us react the way we do. I am not even quite sure who's the parasite. Poor people who discover a window for (a better) living or rich people who take advantage of lower-class people in order to obtain their wealth, not knowing how it is, to be poor?\n",
      "....and I thought \"The Shape of Water\" was a horrible Best Picture winner. \"Joker.\" \"1917.\" \"Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.\" They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards.\n",
      "Its really difficult for a new film to come out & satisfy me & outperform well known masterpiece thrillers from the sixth sense to modern mystery inception\n",
      "But this movie did exactly that i loved this movie more than fight club, inception, se7en,gonegirl,shutter island\n",
      "Give it try for first 5 min, then. U will witness the greatest achievement in filmmaking of this decade\n",
      "This movie has set new standard which i think difficult to crack for normal director\n",
      "You will experience twist after twist while watching this movie. It contains very mild but catchy dark humour. Some scenes will create cold waves inside your lumbar spine. You will be thinking the ways to get rid of the troubles along with the characters of the movie.\n",
      "Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture \"Parasite\" as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. \"Parasite\" by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films.\n",
      "The acting,the story, the surprises and tension of the film is amazing. Shows the poor side of South Korea as well and the difference between rich and poor is ironically presented in many scenes. Watched 2 hours in one breath. Applause for this movies to creators.\n",
      "For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho's \"Parasite\", I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was \"Old Boy\" and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn't expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn't even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn't sure I liked it, but I wasn't sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here's my personal take, and apologies if I don't mention the actors' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn't make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don't think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\", a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn't expect it the catalyst, and film's leitmotif, to be something as trivial as \"smell\". You read me.There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.1/ \"They have the same smell\": we've come to the comical momentum where every member of the \"poor\" family got a job in the rich property. They're all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it's the little kid who smells something 'fishy' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn't treat it as the hint that there's something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver's work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father's reaction, he realizes that he's not just a man or a valuable employee, he's got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father's comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn't been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don't like it, they just don't have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones' perspectives, people who don't mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man's body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter's life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.If there's one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it's \"Parasite\" and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner \"The Eel\", where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius.\n",
      "I can't believe people have rated it 6/10. Just how? Not trying to point out fingers but it feels like most people are frustrated that a foreign movie won the Oscar and they wanted their favorite to win. Anyways everyone deserves to have their opinion.\n",
      "I watched movie yesterday and gosh it was more than Perfect. Most of the time I regret watching a movie coz it's too predictable for me. This one blew my mind. I was literally worried about something might happen or other thing not to happen and the story completely flips to unimaginable plot.\n",
      "Also the details in the movie that the director has gone through. Marvelous.\n",
      "For me, I'll put this movie alongside Shawshank Redemption.\n",
      "The Kim family who are the main characters are not likable at all and greedy too. They do things very irrationally. The first half is quite empty and a bit boring. The park family are so gullible too but they are much more likable as the.... say the bad guys?Mr Kim - the father: his character got the most problem, as the father he didn't make good decisions for the family. He decisions are really bad. They got a young man fired, they don't care if he's poor and miserable as they are. They only think about themselves - selfish.They found out about the maid's secret but instead of negotiating something. They chose to fight all over the place.Mrs Kim the mother is heartless too, she pushed the poor maid down the stairs which ultimately ended her life, and then they tied them up in the bunker, wounded, no food and they go on to live their lives normally. And they expect to find them alive in the following morning?And what's up with that rock, I thought it was going to be used for something important but no it was there all this time so that it would used to smashed the son's head. lolThe party is where everything goes wrong. When the bunker guy show up and stab the kim sister and looking to kill the mother, it wasn't Mr Kim's problem at that time, his mind was totally on Mr park, and helping his family comes second I guess. he went ahead and stab Mr Park even though he employed him and pay him good money. He then left his bleeding daughter and son and his wounded wife to go hide in the bunker. Gimme a break.the behavior of the Kim family can't be excused because they re just poor. Poor people don't normally behave in an erratic way and are contented.And since both the Kim family and the Park family helped each other in certain ways, knowingly or unknowingly, isn't their relationship symbiotic? I mean it's not parasitic since both are benefitting from each other right? the Kim family get to enjoy the life of wealth while they are taking care of the Park family's kids and house. the relationship is symbiotic, therefore the film's title should be Symbiosis not Parasite in that case hahaha just sayingThe film overall doesn't left as much impact\n",
      "on me as say joker did.\n",
      "The movie is very good and very entertaining you will not feel boring during watch it\n",
      "The ending was little dissapointed and the fate of some character was unfair\n",
      "I already saw the comment on capitalism and the other layers of human nature and relationships other times in other films. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, maybe that's on me and my expectations.\n",
      "Movie was recommended by friend, who lauded it how many rewards it had gotten, so we watched this with high expectations. Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie.\n",
      "I have seen many films this decade, especially in 2019. However, though many have slipped to the back of my mind, Parasite is the movie title on the edge of my tongue when asked 'what movie do you recommend?' and will be until the next movie blows me away like Parasite did (this may be a while). I watched this movie a while ago but decided to voice my opinion after last lights Oscar success. Very rarely do I explain so little about a movie and just explain to the person 'just watch the movie' yet until you watch it, you won't undertsand why. True Masterpiece.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho strikes again with this modern art masterpiece, this movie literally blew my mind with its great combination of comedy and tragedy.\n",
      "One of the finest, perfect, enjoyable movies of this decade, Thanks to Bong Joon-ho and thanks to the seventh art who allows us to witness such beauty like this.\n",
      "I don't know how to start this I'm speechless!!I don't want to spoil anything but WATCH IT!!\n",
      "I was just stunned as the movie ends. The plot is both unreal and real at the same time. So unreal, so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people's moral..The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters, as when Ki-woo was entering Parks' villa, the surrounding was just pushing towards him.I really like some of the details of the movie's plot, especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain, probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain-free dwelling, only to find out the basement flooded. The scene when Ki-jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic. No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done, the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound. The scene when the Parkers' dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun-sae's back was also amazing. I might be over interpreting, but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun-sae dies, nobody would care, not even human's best friend.Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors' expressions when watching the subbed version.And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles, the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn't read them. Maybe I'll watch it online someday and figure out what I missed.\n",
      "It's great movie with good story and you should watch it one time in your life and it's a best movie I ever watched in my life that explain you the feel of poor life and rich life but its have some unclear things for example why the children didn't tell his parents about the man s massageBut finally its deserve good ranking on IMDb\n",
      "Parasite is a must see film for the ages. It was fantastic a film that needs to be seen on the big screen. The acting was some of the best I have seen in years.Parents this film is rated R for language sexual content and violence\n",
      "This film has one of the most compelling premises and buildups in of any film in recent years.However, the ending left me rather cool and I felt that a story with such a gripping narrative should have something a little more well thought out.It's almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film. Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror. I'm interested to know if there was studio intervention on this point because it almost feels like another filmmaker took over.Unfortunately, this bend basically broke the reality of the film for me. But the primary build up of the film is so great its still definitely worth a watch.\n",
      "If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre. It's intense, gritty yet subtle like- rollercoaster inside of a maze- type journey will leave you speechless at the end of this masterpiece.\n",
      "It's straight up an exploitation thriller, where the equivalent of korean rednecks, finally getting their chance to exploit and abuse the well to do. ( which in this movie is not even portrayed as being amoral or deserving it in some other ways )filmed well, acted well, good thrills, but as expected in this genre, a shocking ending and a messy denouement.But nothing specialfor professional and amateur critics to comment that this is a rumination on class struggle, oppression of the poor and the comeuppance for the rich, just shows that they either never watched the film and allowed whatever political prejudice they have to write the film criticism for them, or that they are easily swayed by these professional critics.\n",
      "The film started off well and an interesting concept started developing However , it suddenly turned into mayhem and utter stupidity . It was nonsensical .Yes, I got the message about the rich and poor divide etc etc but that's nothing new and just reality . I was disappointed in this movie as I'd read great reviews. It was an utter waste of time !\n",
      "Writer and director Bong Joon-ho has created a deranged masterpiece with Parasite. The first half of the movie was slow and repugnant to watch. Then, as the second half begins (when the former housekeeper shows up at night while the owners are away), it took a sharp turn into left field and became incredibly funny - though still very dark - and maintained the pace, humour and creativity right through to the end.This is not a formulaic movie for Sheeple. If you like black comedy, originality, creativity, foreign/Korean films and bold storytelling, then this is the movie for you.Laugh-out-loud, tears-in-eyes, wildly inventive stuff. Insane script, brilliant execution. Film art at its finest.\n",
      "The movie is a little bit dramatic but it portrays the inequality in every society. Full of twists too\n",
      "I can sit here and talk about how the acting was, and what the parasite represents, how this movie can change the industry, and how the lightning and music was.. all the typical reviewer bull****\n",
      "But I actually just wanna give this 10 stars and urge YOU to go watch it. Please do yourself the favor.. It's fantastic!\n",
      "The movie is truly a masterpiece...! I don't understand how this movie with such local sentiments can deliver something that is so universal...!The best cinematic experience I had this year. Everything is perfect.\n",
      "I have never watched a Korean movie before, I really liked the movie and I recommend people to watch it. Great actors, great story & a masterpiece that you have to watch.\n",
      "The end of the movie is ok for me but I could be better\n",
      "I don't mind symbolism. I think it adds extra depth to a story, granted you're looking for it.\n",
      "But if a story cannot exist strongly without symbolism...it's not really a story worth telling. This was one of them. The locations ran old after a very short amount of time and the ending was SO long and drawn out. And to come to what conclusion? Pretty flimsy.\n",

      "After all the hype I came away from this film terribly disappointed. I gave it 6/10 because the beginning captured me, then sadly the whole plot got lost in the brutality. I have seen better films about Rich and Poor come out of South Korea. Sadly this is not one of them.The story lacked good direction, and logic. It felt like the writers were struggling with the whole flow of the plot. Not something I could recommend as a must see.\n",
      "The Emperors new clothes, that sums up the reaction to this movie. This movie is the modern day \"Slumdog Millionaire\". One of the strangest Oscar decisions ever. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, but a masterpiece? LOLOLOLOL, no - not at all. The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor. At no point does this movie grip you and beg you to keep watching to learn where it goes. Years from now like \"Slumdog\" we will look back, especially at the cinematography and laugh at how great we thought this was.\n",

      "As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..\n",
      "RATING\n",
      "4.0/5.0\n",
      "The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece.\n",
      "I loved this: it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced. The use of colour, space and sound is superb. The actors are perfect and it's just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time. I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort: the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches; a different species, parasitic, work shy, undeserving. And, as one of the characters points out, if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people? The wealthy here are not evil, simply oblivious.\n",
      "Done very well even the topic is not new. The casting fits like a glove and their acting is great. However the ending is disappointing and rushed - they could have done much better than that!\n",
      "Such a great unique master piece! the kind of movie that surprises you. its hard to know whats coming next.\n",
      "For me this movie give uncomfortable feeling... Even though it has nice first half... I don't why this movie got Oscar 😒\n",
      "After watching this \"masterpiece\", I felt as if there was missing something, or a major twist was left out.\n",
      "I was told by plenty of people, that you would be amazed about the twists, and there would be a lot of surprises. Which sadly didn't happen, and I really felt that it was missing that huge \"WHAT!?\" feel, which never came.\n",
      "Everything was so predictable, and there wasn't as much comedy as expected.\n",
      "I wouldn't see it again, but I'm good now that I have seen it tho.\n",
      "First impressions: A striking contrast between the visual ambiance (smooth or pastel colors, cute) and the story (super dark).It kind of recalled me A Clockwork Orange somehow. The dark humor, manipulations, the underlying terror settling in, the sudden violence, the social questioning.\n",
      "Amazing job all around from all that were involved in making this masterpiece. It starts slow but trust me stay along for the ride because at the end you will just say WOW !!!\n",

      "Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment.\n",
      "A film with a not very specific style. Average acting power, not so good screenplay, good direction, and overall an interesting and good movie, but not to the extent that the Oscar will give it the best picture. There were really better options to win in the movies of 2019. There are sequences in the movie that the viewer has no connection with and are just for the continuation of the movie, things happen that are not logical at all and the dialogues are extremely basic. I emphasize that the movie is a good movie for Korean cinema, but not to the extent of winning an Oscar. In the previous years, there have been much better movies in Korean cinema that did not receive any Oscar, such as Oldboy or Lady Vengeance. In general, I don't have anything else to say, I don't know, maybe I have a low cinema sense.\n",
      "Unbeleivable this crap won best picture Ghoulish gory cheap little slasher movie Pathetic the brilliant Marriage Story lost out to this sensationalist absurdity\n",
      "The storyline, cinematography, is very very delight\n",
      "I am grateful to have learned to read early and not have problems with subtitles. Americans should try a little to be less lazy.\n",

      "Preconceived ideas of peoples worth and actions.\n",
      "I was so nervous as the film came to a close. It was very intriguing! Wonderful!\n",
      "I'm afraid to say this movie is evidence to the press, PR and political agenda driven bile we are subjected to daily. Basically, it's 100% over hyped.\n",
      "The emperors new clothes is an hour too long. It's a terribly crass, dull story that's simply well shot.\n",
      "The movie and it's PR machine and subsequent Oscars are an insult to the peoples intelligence.\n",
      "If constipation is your favoured hobby, dive in. If not... avoid.\n",
      "Just watched the movie and can't say it lives up to the hype around it. It had funny moments, thriller moments and a message. It was interesting overall but the ending could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this film to a friend, for instance. Not because it was bad but because I felt that it was missing something.\n",
      "This film has one of the best set ups in recent memory. The stealthy way in which these two families begin to mingle is really extraordinary.However, there is a turning point in the film in which the entire tone of the film charges. It become very dark and gruesome almost to a comical extreme. I'd be very interested to know if there has been external pressure on the director to push the film in a different direction.\n",
      "Skip this movie. Cannot understand how anyone can think this is good.\n",
      "One of the most over-rated movie of last years. Rated as 30th best movie of all time? It can be in 150 but no more. Not that realistic (not because its comedy style, because it has wrong parts), detailed and effective storyline. It has wrong parts that could not happen, the nonsense parts I mean. I also watched Memories Of Murder, not so different than this movie, but Parasite is so over-rated. Over-rated on websites and Academy Awards.\n",
      "I don't know how can be this movie the first Best Picture winner with foreign language. I know the Best Picture awards are not quite very well chosen. But we have seen amazing tens of movies from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Germany but none of them won the Best Picture in 100 years and this one won? Not that amazing and the other nominations was not that bad. Academy Awards only well chosen on Actor and Actress awards.\n",
      "Plot is perfect. there is just no flaw that is even slightly noticed. acting of all cast members are good. music accompanies scenes very well. the movie covers all genres without making any too much. funny, touching, suspending, sexual, family moments are all there, even horror ones. what left in your mind is a subtle yet powerful message about class discrimination in Korea. It truly deserves the Oscar without needing to employ politics or racial issues.\n",
      "It's easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars. It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting.\n",
      "The subtitles might be a bit much for non-koreans but the movie more than makes up for it. I complained when it won eight million academy awards because of all the other great movies but now see why it is so praised. A serious contender for \"Movies better than Old Boy\".\n",
      "First things first, this movie has an incredible cast, all acting their roles with precision on the more serious times and humour when needed. Visually this movie was solid, with the camrea set-ups being almost poetic. I love the idea of infulltration and contrast in this movie, the idea of contradiction is very prevelant and very well done. This also has one of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a very long time, every single peice of dialouge contributes towards which every setpeice they are trying to sep up. The humour of this movie was absolutley spot on too, delivering clever and defining moments for almost every charcter.\n",
      "I felt there was a lot of unused themes, like the Chekhov's gun principle and the family was fairly smart but jobless, it doesn't fit. More goofy than a masterpiece.\n",
      "All in all it was a decent movie and worth my time, I think its rating though is inflated by the social class messages throughout the movie.\n",
      "In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!\n",
      "I just finished the movie and it's truly a masterpiece, from the combination of drama/comedy/horror to the detailed portrayal of social inequality...If I could point out just ONE thing I didn't like, is how they toss the writing right at the end. So the kid says he's going to get rich, and so he does? After the movie was making a clear statement of how difficult it is for the poor to level up? I just found that particular part to be \"too easy\"... But other than that, it is a superb film.\n",
      "This is a great movie and exciting scenario except from the ending.\n",
      "The Oscars awards lost its reputation in my eyes.\n",
      "The movie definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar and if it's the opposite then I'm the cruelest critic ever!!!\n",
      "This kind of story about poverty and inequality isn't uncommon throughout the rest of the world. They nearly always have a tragic ending because, and let's be real here, this is the only kind of ending most of the people in the world can accept as real. Things don't work out. That brief peek at happiness we see at the end? That's what the few fortunates might expect; it's how our stories typically end, and so it was a brutal but honest last point in case there was any doubt.\n",
      "Being poor sucks and there is no poetry in misery: it stunts your emotional and sometimes even physical growth. Sometimes you can fight back and improve, sometimes you are just have to suck it up and surrender, which makes you bitter and angry.\n",
      "This is what this movie is about: the loss of innocence of the poor and the blessed naivety of the rich.\n",
      "Honestly this movie is definitely one that lived up to the hype and deserved every single accolade and award. if you can watch a movie without staring at your phone for the majority of the film in this day and age it's definitely because the movie is capturing .. it had me hooked for 2 hours without being distracted\n",
      "I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.Park Seo-Hoon offers his poorer friend a job to tutor a high school girl he plans on asking out when she gets into university. He doesn't want drunken frat students to be near her. He is studying abroad and wants him to look after her.The mother of the rich family is gullible and the son is able to slide in a girl named Jessica who does art tutoring. Next day his sister comes in and she says the famous poem outside the gate. The son kisses the rich family's daughter who he tutors.The art tutor refers a driver she knows who is actually her dad after a scandal happened that was caused by her. The family asked their driver to drive her home as it was night and he did so but the sneaky girl removed her panties and dropped it in the back. The rich dad was sitting in the backseat and found the panties. He discusses this with his wife - he wonders if their driver gets off from having his sperm on the seat. He says a young guy's sex life is none of his business but it is gross. That was when the art tutor's recommendation was wanted and her father is hired.The father reports to the rich mom that their housekeeper has tuberculosis. He overheard her at the hospital apparently. She doesn't it is just that she has an extreme allergy to peaches and they took advantage of this. The father drips sauce that looks like blood into the tissue in the garbage. The housekeeper is fired.The rich family is off to go camping for their son's birthday. The four employees gather in the living room and watch the rain in the yard. Very classy. The daughter uses the bathtub and watches TV. Her brother comes in offering her a drink.The housekeeper rings the doorbell and asks to get something downstairs. Turns out she has been keeping her husband in the bunker. It is dirty and messy - we see condoms there too.The mom receives a call from rich mom that they are coming home. She wants her to make ram yun. The family manages to keep the couple downstairs. Kevin, the father and sister scurry to clean and hide as the rich family comes home in 8 minutes.Later that evening the son decides to camp outdoors in the rain and the parents decide to sleep in the living room. The three hiders are under the table. The father starts to fondle his wife's breasts and she tells him what if their son comes in. She then gives in and tells him to do it clockwise. He rubs her pelvic area and she rubs his. They sigh and it is very awkward for the trio under the table who give no reaction.The trio manage to run out but there is a huge rainstorm and it is flooding. Their home is flooded out. They try to salvage what they can and they sleep at a gym with a ton of other people.The next day rich mom wants to invite the art tutor for her son's birthday.

Park So Dam is stabbed fatally. Mom has many cuts but manages to stab a skewer into the man. The father is sick of rich dad yelling at him and ordering him around. He takes a knife and kills rich dad.Kevin wakes up laughing in the hospital. At court him and mom are charged with probation only. Authorities keep looking for his dad. Using Morse Code he figures out his dad is downstairs in the basement. Kevin plans on becoming rich to buy that home. His sister has passed and her ashes are in an urn.\n",
      "The story was really good and enjoyable but, it was kinda a let down knowing how much people hyped this movie. It won so many awards but why. It was not that shocking at all. But the best part about it was the acting and cinematography.If you want to watch a really crazy mind blowing movie you should watch Old Boy. It's another Korean film that deserved more praise than this movie.\n",

      "The movie is bad quality, and seeing people trying to feel good about their social sensibility upon a garbage like this is to see how lost people are nowadays.\n",
      "At first, you'll see it as a comedy, but then the director take you on a magical mystery ride and you'll never know what waiting for you up ahead. 10/10 a must watch movie\n",

      "What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic\n",
      "The storytelling is amazing! Bong Joon Ho did it again.\n",
      "Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing.\n",
      "The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors, but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary!You won't be disappointed watching it.\n",
      "Again, highly overrated.\n",
      "Absolutely Fantastic. The best movie i've seen in my life.\n",
      "O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock: from a \"Western\" perspective, very few people will have seen a film like this. The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too.\n",
      "Parasite failed to grab my interest near the start. Later on it picks up momentum and becomes quite engaging. But this is less because I liked it and more because it manages to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions. By the end, it felt like the exercise was a waste of time or worse. Worse because I worry that the filmmakers and many fans actually sympathise with the murderers, just because they're apparently poor.The premise falls apart when you think about it. While it's somewhat entertaining at first, seeing the main family lie a bit to get jobs supporting a rich family, it really sinks in that there's no reason for them to be poor. If the girl can fake university documents, if the boy can tutor English, if the father knows streets well and can drive confidently - why on Earth can't they get proper jobs? They can fake being qualified and well-off so they can succeed in job interviews!Little lies are one thing, like faking a degree to get your foot in the door. It's wrong, but it's not that bad if we're meant to believe there's some kind of unfair system. But after that, we see more and more how immoral, selfish and ungrateful the \"poor\" family is. As Dickens might put it, however poor they are in terms of wealth, they're much poorer when it comes to decency and morals.The girl lying about art therapy to manipulate the mother is appalling. Are we meant to find that funny? The way she talks about the rich family behind their backs is also very demeaning. The main bad things the rich family does is 1) be rich (so what?) and 2) complain about smell. Nobody likes bad smells. It's very reasonable that a part of progressing economically is taking care of personal hygiene. It's a practical thing, not a class thing.What they do to the previous maid is also terrible. Abusing her allergy. And planting underwear to frame the driver. The boy flirting with the girl he's meant to be tutoring.They don't care about the lives they ruin, as long as they get ahead. We never once see them apply for jobs. They use their intelligence to manipulate others and only progress by bringing others down. I felt that the only happy ending would be one where they all get killed by some psycho killer, or at least where they all get exposed.The best section is in the middle where a single night spirals out of control and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But even this was somewhat predictable and convenient for the writers. Why are they partying at this house? Who couldn't guess that an emergency would arise and the family would return early?The maid coming back and having her husband locked in a cellar was a nice touch. You don't know where the story is going from there. But while this could make for a decent horror or thriller, it doesn't gel with the rest of the movie, which is more of a comedy/drama.The ending is frustrating. I hated the poor family. They've now killed a woman on top of everything else. I understand the cellar husband's desire for revenge. But when the poor father kills the rich father? There was no justification for that. I liked the rich family. They were nice people. The father earned his money. The mother cared about her children and was very open and kind. The kids are normal kids.It makes no sense. The dad hides in the cellar. Sure. But you're telling me the police didn't look there? The son's bloody body was right next to the cellar entrance. They didn't search the room? Look at blueprints for the house? This guy comes out of nowhere, probably presumed dead, and goes on a rampage and they don't search the house more thoroughly?And it seems like the filmmakers want us to empathise with the murderous father. Sorry, but he should rot in jail. Along with his whole family who were complicit in all this. The maid was pretty crazy too, keeping her husband in a cellar. Wasn't she earning enough? Couldn't they pay off the debt, even if it took years? Why not be honest to the rich family?Parasite is misguided and extremely overrated. It's decent as a thriller/horror, at least for part of its running time. It has good acting and directing. There are a few funny moments. But the message is deeply confused and immoral. Poverty doesn't justify murder. Or lying or destroying other people's jobs.And if you have so many skills (the girl seems very smart and good with computers), why are you folding pizza boxes for a living? They can't get proper jobs? I call BS. Even when they all get jobs by lying, they don't move to a better apartment or improve their lifestyle. They're only poor because the script says so, not because it's remotely believable.\n",
      "Movies are about people. And this movie described struggle of lower class. A beatiful piece.\n",
      "Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one.\n",
      "A haunting parable, with so many stark images that will forever be burned into my brain. A pointed highlight of the differences between the haves and have-nots. A sublimely original movie that's full of surprises and unnerving but hilarious anxiety.\n",
      "Two nuclear families - Mum, Dad, son, daughter; one filthy rich, one filthy poor. The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation. Did I mention the great acting?I do wonder what happened when the son's friend, who got him the tutoring gig in the first place, got back from university. Parasite II, anybody? (joke)\n",
      "A really good movie, that deserved the Oscar, i was cheering for Joker but what the hell right?\n",
      "Love to see movies that are different than what comes out of USA studios, and this one was unique and fresh. After seeing it I have added Seoul as my next destination, it just will not happenduring rainy season. 🤣This film showed that life is not so different around the world. For example the way the rich folk in this film looked on the downtrodden folk; it reminded me of life in 1970s when I grew up in South America.Yes it merits the awards it received at the Oscars.\n",
      "The acting was great on the part of the con artist family. Mrs Park was just pathetic. Her character was played like she had an IQ of 50. I thought the story line as a whole was clever, but the very end was predictable. I knew exactly where the father Mr Kim went. I didn't like that he stabbed Mr Park. I didn't think that was in character, and it wasn't deserved. The poverty of the other family was not the Parks' fault. Their wealth inequality was just circumstance, and they were at the worst just ignorant. I couldn't root for the poor family because I didn't feel sorry for them. They could have used their wits to make better more honest choices to try and get ahead. Instead they chose to dupe people and take advantage of them. I liked that they showed the son at the end sitting in the apartment saying \"someday\" he will have enough money. A happy ending like the one they teased wouldn't have been fitting.\n",
      "I love Breaking Bad. I watched the entirety of it three times. But at the first go, it took getting to season 4, episode 11 (Crawl Space) for my mind to go numb from the intensity, and to season 5, episode 14 (Ozymandias) for it to crumble. That is how long it took me to understand the hype.Parasite did it in less than 2 hours.\n",
      "Exaggerated acting ( which even in Korean standards were terrible ) , really long unnecessary guilt trip to poverty. Most of the viewers will bored before the second half and the ones that say they loved the movie are just afraid to be labelled as ignorant or racist. I am not saying this is a terrible movie , but before declaring this one as One of the greatest in Asian cinema , try watching several Asian movies . There is nothing new or nothing eye opening about this movie. It is just another marvel of marketing. Anyway I will not suggest this one to anybody. Go watch les-miserables if you wish to watch a guilt trip movie with a style and quality.\n",
      "This movie paints a picture of necessity. One family needs to survive, another to to thrive, and when the tempo clash, there will be casualties on both sides. Life goes on for both families, but it shows that the less fortunate are more prone to violence.\n",
      "The movie is very well planned, if the viewer isn't watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great. The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities... I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen.\n",
      "I really liked the movie a lot. It is extraordinary.\n",
      "The plot is a unique masterpiece. Like most Korean movies, it is maybe not for everyone's stomach. It is a brutal, honest and a raw dark comedy, which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist.\n",
      "It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences. So, whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality, packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them, has to see this movie.\n",
      "To link and tie the story together which starts as comedy - then to drama - and then thriller, and ends with crime seamlessly is simply phenomenal. The only reason why I gave it a 9 is I am not a fan of subtitles. It truly is top-notch brilliant filmmaking by Joon Ho. He deserves all the Oscars wins. Bravo!\n",
      "I managed to not know much about this before watching. Was genuinely surprised by a few plot twists, and was at the edge of my seat or holding my breath for many moments, with many laughs at the believable absurdity in between. In the end, I felt this was a thought-provoking commentary on the desperation and feelings of being trapped experienced by many in poverty.\n",
      "After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades.\n",
      "After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable.\n",
      "From a thriller of Memories of Murder to a monster film of The Host, Bong Joon Ho could transform a family drama as entertaining as never before.Truly an unexpected, perfect, blend of genres to satirize class division and hypocrisy.Even the dialogue scenes are not tiresome, but intriguing and often hilarious.Well done Korean Cinema, proud of you!\n",
      "The Parasite shows Korean house architects that calls 'Banjiha'(lower level house). Because it appears only at Korea, I taught its mood for Korean, but all over the world liked it!.\n",
      "What a movie ! What a story ! Beautiful , inventive, original, at the end you are on heaven...\n",
      "Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month, also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to.\n",
      "I loved this movie so much!\n",
      "The film is interesting, thought provoking, there is drama, comedy and an impressive plot twist.\n",
      "All my friends who watched it liked and so did I.\n",
      "I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language.\n",
      "Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was \"A Taxi Driver\" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.\n",
      "After watching Parasite, I was very inclined and interested in looking for other Bong Joon-ho's films.\n",
      "The powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. Parasite clearly portrayed what class division in a society. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!\n",
      "Highly recommended if you like korean movies.\n",
      "I had high expectations given the raving reviews here. But I have to say, I was disappointed. Fair enough, it is a decent movie with an original plot, but certainly not one of the best films of all time. Not by a long shot.\n",
      "This is the first and only movie I've felt compelled to write a review for.Admittedly, I rarely watch foreign language films because of having to read subtitles, but I made a point this year of watching every Oscar-nominated film I could. I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into it, and I think that's what made the film so compelling. Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction.Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it.\n",
      "This movie feels so-so, far from boasting so good, or I give too great expectations, the result is too big, the plot is too ordinary, and many people hold this film to the altar\n",
      "I'm not asking anyone to agree with me ... but I did not find this film beautiful moving or touching in any way shape or form... nothing that happened in this film was believable... and if we just give out acadamy awards for a bunch of random crap happening in a movie .... there is a reason this one won 4... don't fall for the hype and accidentally pay for this film like I did... waste of money and time...\n",
      "I just watched \"Parasite\" for the first time. It is currently February and I watched the film for the first time around Thanksgiving. I loved it back then and I love it even more now. Definitely is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.\n",
      "This movies plot is absolutely insane but that is not the important part of the movie. It is really a story about trying to move up in the world and how that's an impossibility. And that even the hope can destroy you.\n",
      "The movie is thrilling, beautifully directed, heart felt, etc.. Also, from a re-watch point of view you pick up many new points of analysis and get to notice how beautifully edited this movie is.\n",
      "I want to write more but that would get into spoilers and you would stop reading. But watching this movie is a NECESSITY.\n",
      "Some people say that this movie is \"disgusting\", thats because actually it is: social inequality unveiled, disgusting and unpleasant as it is.\n",
      "Who are the parasites?\n",
      "To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!\n",
      "It's one of the greatest films I've ever watched in my life. Truly a masterpiece. It was so captivating and an emotional roller coaster. It's an absolute must see!! It deserved every award it got and I'm so proud to see it win 4 oscars. Truly deserved and more. Bong joon ho created one of the most creative, unique, amazing films I've seen.\n",
      "In my view it is neither too good nor too bad\n",
      "But somwhere in middle\n",
      "This work is one of the greatest films that I have seen ... Indeed, it is a masterpiece in the fullest sense of the word in terms of direction, which was a professional of all professionalism or the method of sequencing events that were easy for the viewer and makes him coordinate with the events without even feeling ... more on that The performance of the actors that was so great that you feel that you are involved with them in the events or rather merge with it ... The bottom line is this movie is creativity creativity creativity\n",
      "The wokeness I am referring to is Hollywood. Best picture? Because it's a foreign film written by non white males and no white males are in the movie. This is a nice way to cap off the decade of insane wokeness. That is the only conclusion I can come to as to why this won so many Oscars (which have been a joke ever since Shakespeare in Love beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture).\n",
      "Don't believe the hype. This is a crass pretentious movie pretending to be a serious story about class struggle. It's obviously made by luvvies in the Korean film industry clique. The ending proves this theory.\n",
      "In this movie Bong Joon-ho directs like Billy Wilder plus Alfred Hitchcock... the result is just unique. The plot is not only original but contemporary, funny, scary and poetic at the same time.\n",
      "Remarkable.\n",
      "A timeless Masterpiece, a review wouldn't do this film proper justice, just go watch it.\n",
      "Well deserving of its four oscars in Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay). Still i am a bit dissapointed that non of the cast was even nominated for acting. All around gripping and mesmerizing preformances & plot.\n",
      "This film was incredibly well shot and thought out! It had basically everything to have in a drama thriller film. Its my first Joon-ho Bong film and my god it was perfect! I love drama, I love thriller and crime. It hit the perfect spot for my liking and the story was perfect and emotional throughout! The awards given to this film were well deserved and after watching the film I can see why. I think I have became a fan of Mr. Bong's films and im off to watch his other hits!\n",
      "Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi. Que filme perfeito, cenas incriveis, roteiro peculiar, amo tudo. História é genial, muito diferente de tudo que ja vi.\n",
      "The series is all about a family showing through the differences in between the classes in the society too, a great series to binge watch too. The series is always gripping the story line and keeps the watcher entertained as well as on the edge to whats going to happen next in the series.The series is a good walkthrough the differences in the state of the life in our society depending upon the finically or physically. The series as all the pov and everything for all the characters in the series so the audience gets the mindset and the vision for all the character's in it to understand there situation from there view.\n",
      "The story was good. Acting is great. It basically shows the reality of rich and poor difference that exists in our society no matter what. My only reason to give it 6 star is with all the hype this movie has, My expectations were way too high and sadly it didn't live upto that.\n",
      "After seeing all the glowing reviews I feel like I am in an episode of the Twilight Zone. This movie was awful. The only reason I even gave it an overrated 2 is because it was weird. I like weird but this was goofy weird. Most of it didn't make any sense at all. The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself. The poor family couldn't even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight. Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after - they let him attack the mom and they don't even try to help her. The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn't even try to help. Then instead of attacking the attacker, he runs over and kills his boss! It make no sense whatsoever. One of the most bizarre and goofy movies I have ever seen.\n",
      "A movie demonstrating different classes in society, accompanied with great acting, an original plot and beautiful cinematography, if you want a movie that you can find new things and hidden meanings everytime you rewatch, Parasite is THE movie you want, certainly one of the best movies of last decade and completely deserved all single awards it won.\n",
      "This film seems like all those I've seen at home without even wanting to watch a movie, it's so good, it catches you.And I love it.From the beginning to the end of it, we can see how clever this production is, how smooth, how well intended... I love that it doesn't threaten itself as a cult film by wanting to be a very serious film (even though it is) and leaving space for regular conversations between characters. Not everything in a movie must be relevant to the plot, sometimes we just want a long or short walk in the universe of the film, and that's ok too!I want to thank the director for it, I love this style.\n",
      "Saw it in cinema twice. Have nothing bad to say about it. I knew Bong-Joon Ho from Okja, which was a decent movie but not very special. So when it came out at a film festival I decided to go see it and I wasn't disappointed.\n",
      "It was so unpredictable, such a twist, so off the rails into the stratosphere, it's just - wow. Utterly a roller-coaster.I never would have expected something like this from a Korean movie - it's just not how they usually feel to me, it's more something like Seth MacFarlane does in his Family Guy or American Dad.It's serious, meaningful, so alive, and so tragic, so heart-breaking and so terrifying. And in the same time kinda light and funny. It never an overdose of either emotion, it's just enough to enjoy their somewhat sharp sensation. I just usually like those things, and this one is perfectly done, perfectly balanced, spiced and fresh.\n",
      "Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multi tonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.\n",
      "I think the film does a good job of exploring the theme of class. The Kim family is a poor family who is constantly struggling to make ends meet. They are forced to take on menial jobs and live in a cramped basement apartment. The Park family, on the other hand, is a wealthy family who lives in a luxurious mansion. The two families are worlds apart, and the film explores the ways in which the Kim family tries to exploit the Park family's wealth.The film shows how deception can be used to gain power and influence, but it also shows how it can backfire.Good film for anyone who enjoys dark and twisted comedies, or for anyone who is interested in the themes of class and deception.\n",
      "The first half of the movie is brilliant, unfortunately the main characters go from being geniuses with great social skills in the first half to being idiots in the second half. Considering their social abilities, they should have easily been able to make a deal where everybody wins or to manipulate their opponents to their advantage in the second half of the movie. Instead they turn into idiots so that we can get a \"social commentary ending\".\n",
      "So I finally decided to watch this movie today and I am just blown away because I definitely heard about it when it first came out and all the awards and all the other movies it topped and granted I watched it with a baby and a toddler so it was a lot of pausing and definitely gonna rewatch it, but this movie was amazing from beginning, middle, and end. It was truly worthy of everything at one I am beyond surprised like I did not know what I was in Stored for I never read anything about it but I definitely wanted to see it and today was the day and I'm so glad I did like I would love to watch this with my husband and just sit back and enjoy it like this was hands-down, one of the best films. I've watched in a very long while and funny thing is, it was recommended when I was looking at what was like gone girl and I enjoyed that movie even though it pissed me off, but it was a great plot too, but this one was definitely one you wanna watch.\n",
      "A brilliant an enjoyable movie to watch, I was invested throughout the whole film. Although in parts it dragged however there was great character building and ultimately I cared for all the characters I wasn't sure who the hero or the villain was!But the ending, wow I was gobsmacked. I knew something bad would happen but didn't think it would be that bad. I must admit that I was a little confused as to why the poor father (Sorry, I've forgotten their names) killed the rich father just because he stank. Didn't feel that would happen in real life and did feel rather ridiculous.The film was very long I felt they could've cut parts and perhaps gave us more closure towards the end. Every scene after the stabbings felt rushed and it was alot of information to take in, felt like they could've elaborated on this part on the movie.7-8/10.\n",
      "Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me.\n",
      "Beautifully filmed and acted! One family inserts itself into another, and neither will be the same again. And the way they address the socioeconomic disparities through the use of smell is really interesting. I didn't love the ending, but the rest was thoroughly engaging!\n",
      "I did enjoy this film, but it didn't strike me as a worthy Oscar winner.\n",
      "Who are the parasites? This is the question going through your mind throughout the film. That's why this film is so good. The rich family living their lives without a care in the world. The poor family desperate to survive. Are the rich family kind, selfish or both? What about the poor family? Who are the parasites? Both families? When the rain comes and floods the \"poor people\", the rich family can only say how pleased they are to have the rain. But is it because they are selfish or are they blissfully unaware? This is story of how people view the world after experiencing two different lives. It's brilliant, full of questions and thoughts.\n",
      "Definitely a nice movie to watch. Extreme and unreal situations with scenes that will keep you on your toes. Funny at times and dramatic at others. Acting was very good and the characters were played very well. I don't thing its a movie that you would watch again though, thus 7.\n",
      "I recently watched \"Parasite\", and I have to say, it was a really good movie, but I still have mixed feelings about it. The film was gripping, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but it left me feeling a bit unsettled.First off, the story was amazing. I loved how it started with the poor Kim family trying to make ends meet and slowly infiltrating the wealthy Park family's life. It was clever and often funny to see how they managed to deceive the Parks. The whole idea of the \"parasite\" theme, where the Kims live off the Parks, was really interesting.The acting was top-notch. Every character felt real and relatable. Ki-taek, the father, was especially great, and I felt for him as he tried to provide for his family. The son, Ki-woo, was also fantastic, and his ambition drove much of the plot forward.However, the movie took a dark turn that I didn't see coming. The discovery of the basement and the man living there was shocking. It added a whole new layer of tension and danger. The scene where the old housekeeper returns and tries to reveal the Kims' secret had me on the edge of my seat.The ending was intense and brutal. The birthday party turning into a bloodbath was hard to watch. Seeing Ki-taek snap and kill Mr. Park was unexpected and tragic. It made me question if the Kims were really the \"bad guys\" or just victims of their circumstances.I think what left me with mixed feelings is the bleak message of the movie. It shows the harsh realities of class division and how desperate people can become. While the movie was brilliant, it was also quite depressing. The final scene, where Ki-woo dreams of buying the house to reunite with his father, felt like a punch in the gut because we know it's almost impossible.Overall, \"Parasite\" was a fantastic film with incredible storytelling and performances. It kept me hooked from start to finish, but the dark themes and tragic ending left me feeling conflicted. It's definitely a movie that makes you think and stays with you long after it's over.\n",
      "So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant).\n",
      "Either I am living in an alternate universe - or this movie is being reviewed by paid reviewers in favor of promoting Parasite.I left the cinema after an hour. I haven't done that in 10 + years.\n",
      "Incredibly boring movie.\n",
      "Overacting pervasive.\n",
      "Story-line pedestrian.\n",
      "Give it a wide birth..don't waste your money , or more importantly your time on this movie.\n",
      "It was a really great and funny movie, but really predictable which makes it hard to say if it really is one of the greatest. Of course, it was funny, creative and overall just good.\n",
      "Highly recommend if you're into Mr Bean/Charlie Chaplin comedy\n",
      "Better late than never, I say. Parasite has shocked the film world, in the best way possible. Against all odds, it defeated a crowded field for Best Picture at the Oscars. A field that included heavy hitters like Scorsese and Tarantino. Nobody should have ever counted Parasite out, but the Oscars don't have a track record of awarding Best Picture to groundbreaking independent films, let alone a groundbreaking independent film from South Korea. It's win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere. It's a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes. Garnering international acclaim, people have hailed Parasite as the best film of 2019, and the decade itself. Does it live up to the hype? The answer is an enthusiastic yes.Parasite is one of the best independent films I've ever seen. It's a textbook example of how to take a small idea, and a modest script, with limited locations and launch them all into the stratosphere. Without giving too much away, it centers around two families on opposite sides of the Korean social class. The ultra rich, elite class and the poor. The poor family devises an elaborate scheme to work as servants for the rich family, in the hopes that they can take a taste of aristocratic life, and work their way up the ladder. All is well, until they discover something underneath the house. A third class of servitude is revealed. A class more destitute and subservient to the rich family than the poor family could ever dream of. Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, Parasite serves as an allegory for income inequality and the ways in which the poorest classes of people are often exploited by the rich, with no thanks in return.The best horror films out there tell stories of larger meaning. They need to in order to be properly scary. Bong-Joon Ho allows his agenda to take shape throughout, but cleverly and gracefully, avoids being heavy-handed. For instance, there are no clear heroes and villains in his characters. To Ho, they are all victims of a larger societal struggle. In terms of its visual scope, Parasite is a masterclass in production design and framing. Instantly, the luxurious Park residence has become an iconic backdrop in film history. It's spacious rooms and narrow hallways paint a chilling picture of the enormity of wealth. The large screen door leading to the front yard is reminiscent of a large film screen, almost designed to showcase the importance of the Park family household. At 135 minutes, Parasite tells it's story as fitfully as a best-selling novel. In the end, you don't leave Parasite having missed the point of having watched it. It's satisfying, minute to minute. That's what makes this a great film.\n",
      "PARASITE is a true psychological thriller with a ruthless ending that is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of thought provoking films. I watched this because Bong Joon Ho who wrote SNOWPIERCER also wrote and directed PARASITE.\n",
      "The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned.\n",
      "Thats it for me. Thanks for reading.\n",
      "This drama is tense with suspense and drama. It has some twists and turns and at times, it's dark and creepy. At other times, it's funny. It could have been edited down a good 20 minutes as it dragged in some places (esp. The setup) but overall, very good!\n",
      "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this film. this film was really good from what I saw and it seems that Korea makes a lot of amazing films. the ending is what I remember the most like really what was that all about. this movie ws all over the place\n",
      "One of the most overrated movies i've ever seen. The hype was for nothing and everything was predictable.\n",
      "Genre defying. There is so much happening in this movie - just when you think you have figured it out it shows you something different. It leaves you wondering - who really is the Parasite?\n",
      "I really loved this movie, i had heard about it in the past and even watched the trailer but saved it for later, watched it in its original language with english subtitles. You won't need english dubbing to watch it.The cast was nice, the acting was phenomenal and the plot itself was soo epic and very well paced that this movie keeps you focused in your chair througout.The only reason i have not given it a 10 star rating is because of the ending.Spoiler alert:I really wished that they would've shown some sign of goodness in the rich ppl in the end, instead it just completely portrays them as bad ppl who only care about themselves even in the time of an emergency.The movie would have reached extreme heights and beyond all expectations if the writers would have shows that there is goodness in all of us, no-matter rich or poor.But i guess im more optimistic in general.Anyways,\n",
      "Definitely worth watching, Enjoy.\n",
      "One of the best movies in recent years!\n",
      "Quirky,original and visually stunning.\n",
      "It keeps you on the edge of your seat with constant plot changing.All in a very subtle way.\n",
      "Finally a worthy winner!\n",
      "It will stay with you for days and most importantly ....it will make you forget La La Land.\n",
      "No one is \"evil\". Then how come the bad things happen?This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong?It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal.\n",
      "It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer.\n",
      "It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours.Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it.\n",
      "The great thing about this movie is that rich people actually do nothing wrong. The husband and wife are loving, the children are gratifying, there is no derailment, there is no cold violence, there is no child abuse, and the driver and the servant are generous. Judging from the movies, they are stupid and have more money. They do not have their own main ideas. They are turned around by the poor, as if to play a role in highlighting the poor.\n",
      "I've only viewed this film once and everything about it was beautiful! From the addictive plot to the gorgeous cinematography Bong Joon Ho has crafted a modern masterpiece that I will be revisiting repeatedly.\n",
      "7.5 = very good movie (for me 8+ is excellent)+ Well shot movie\n",
      "+ Good cast\n",
      "+ good dialogue\n",
      "+ 'Memorable epilogue'\n",
      "+ Some good Tarantino like momentsCliched horror/thriller 'slasher' finale with the typical horror movie music. Not original but suprising nonetheless.Could have developed characters slightly better.\n",
      "It makes no sense of the situations. Some scenes were good but the movie is too long for the story. Also, the plot is very predecible in a lot of things.\n",
      "I don't recommend this movie.\n",
      "I'm going to start this film review by saying that this film was amazing in so many different ways, so many different aspects really shone, from the; cinematography, acting, pacing in the narrative, etc, it was really a very impressive film, overall. I really do wish I had watched this film earlier, however I do think I am going to rewatch this film to just really understand the depth and layers of the different characters, the different aspects of the narrative, and the duality in the cinematography between the rich and the poor.Firstly I wanted to talk about the beautiful visual aspects of this film, as since it is a film that isn't in English, and non English speaking films, in the past, have tended to find it hard to gain traction. So the visual storytelling was something that needed to be able to explore and explain the story. The cinematography is subtle and effortless; in its use of focus, framing and composition, color palette, as well as its ability to create a duality in the poor and rich areas. There were some really amazing shots that never felt out of place for the tone it was setting throughout the film, they felt dynamic, varied, and was generally very effective in its visual storytelling. As I mentioned before, there is a visual duality in the houses of the two families, this film utilized the two differing environments to its fullest potential, further accentuating the differences. The rich family's house had nature, open spaces, and was above the ground, which can't be said for the poor family's home which was urban, tight, and half underground with their natural sunlight coming from a window that is privy to drunk people. I also couldn't help but notice that the rich house was more intense in its brightness, and as we as the audience followed our protagonists into the poor area we descended more into the darkness, which is quite astounding and this film is full of these visual storytelling techniques adding to the beauty of it...I love films like these where the stories are compact and every single shot, that makes a sequence, that makes a scene, has meaning and adds to the narrative, pushing it forward. The beginning of the film sets up everything that the story relies and builds upon; the poorer family lives in the underground of society where they are almost left to rot and perish, scrounging for anything they can get their hands on, as opposed to the rich family who live very comfortably, with not a care in the world, oblivious and disgusted by the poor, who, to them, are a completely different species. As the film title implies, the poor family becomes the parasite sucking everything they can out of the rich family, but it turns out there is already a parasite present, which creates that conflict and makes for an amazing story. Seeing these 2 'parasites' fight for their host is so interesting as it explores the vast difference in the mindset of the 2 families, the poorer one showcasing their desperation for this life that the richer family lives so obliviously.There was some excellent acting in this film, the cast was brilliant, I thought that they didn't just play, but they actually embodied those characters. The actress who played the mother of the rich household, Cho Yeo-Jeong, I thought was amazing. That oblivious nature of the rich is perfectly embodied by her. Another performance that I thought really stood out was the performance of Choi Woo-Sik, who played Ki Woo, the son of the poor family. I thought he brought his character through a nice arc throughout the film. In a lot of the scenes he was in, his character's thought processes were subtle yet obvious enough for the audience to acknowledge, which was very nice to see. Those two performances stood out to me but that's not to say the rest of the cast was less, they were amazing...\n",
      "Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-Ho, is a dark satirical film on wealth and inequality. The low-class families in the film are much like parasites, forced to feed off others in order to survive. However, like with parasites, the Kim family couldn't help but to gluttonously take advantage of their situation until the only way out was through drastic measures. What I found most interesting however, is the end of the film. The son seems to have a change of heart, and decided to create his own fortune rather than rely on others. Wether or not he succeeds in this is up for debate, but I found that to be a twist on the movie that really made me think.\n",
      "It's hard to pinpoint what's so great about this movie. Just watch it.\n",
      "I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films purely because they don't want to read subtitles and whatnot because they are really missing out. For the first half of this movie it's great, just a story about a poor family who tries to integrate themselves into the lifestyle of a Rich family. The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it. Does it deserve all the praise it gets? Honestly I'd say yes. Like this is one of the best onscreen portrayals of economic inequality and corruption of wealth I've ever seen. The ending is brilliant, but I wouldn't even call it bong joon he's best.10/10.\n",
      "At first you will think that the movie is normal and tells the story of an extraneous family, but the end will show you how crazy it is I loved how it made me conflicted in my feelings, and this is what made me give it 9, even though it is not the best in many respects, but it was a special experience.How the ending was presented is exactly the thing that aroused my interest, and between a hater, a shocker, and a lover, I stuck my thoughts and feelings towards the movie.I loved the viewing experience so much that at the end it made me stop a few times scratching my head in shock and I'm glad I did.\n",
      "Poor people can cheat, all of them are good at deception, with this deception and acting, but still live in the basement? The rich can be naive, the whole family simple without brains, was sold to help a few money, really can live in a big villa?\n",
      "Rife with metaphor and social commentary, Parasite brilliantly juxtaposes the three families portrayed through its filmography and stunning and meticulous visual construction. A black comedy, horror and thriller all at once, the film manages to transcend genres and redefine the idea of a staircase film. Each and every frame serves to emphasize the line between the two classes, and by its end, we are left wondering who the parasite referenced in the title is.I thought some characters were a touch underdeveloped and some plot points unexplored, but I have no qualms about giving this a full 5 stars. Beautiful movie, great script, great acting, consistent style, deeply rooted themes. As near perfection as a film can be.10/10: Sublime. Genre transcendent. Cannot\n",
      "say enough.\n",
      "I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job. I guess the ending bothered me a little bit, but I'll admit it helped to reinforced what the movie was trying to say.\n",
      "This movie is flat-out horrible. Not funny, not interesting, a hard watch. Way over-hyped. Had to shut it off half way through. Zero interest to watch it again.\n",
      "This family is so entertaining and real and the story is so so real and engaging and it has such a strong message about status and class!!! I really enjoyed it!!!\n",
      "Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising.\n",
      "Ki-woo being crippled by something that really started this movie is very ironic and sad at the same time. Something that really excited me in this movie is the cinematography and the turning point of this movie - from the funny joke to the absolute psycho mode. Can't get enough of the idea of this movie, how everyone from success ended up being that one they were trying to get rid off. This movie comes-off like a great art with absurd soundtrack that still sounds good. This movie is near 10, it could be more artistic from the cinematography point, but still a must-watch.\n",
      "At the end of the day, this is an intellectual film. Bong Joon-Ho touches upon the specific themes of wealth and fairness. He shows us a journey of the poor learning truly how little the rich care about anything. With motifs like poor people having a certain smell only the rich can pick up on repeatedly thrown in the movie, the message gets driven home, but is not so in your face. This film has a profound message in a way, you'll just have to watch it to find out.Overall, plot aside, this film has pretty nice cinematography and really great acting. Kang ho Song has my favorite performance in the movie, and with just the look on his face during one of the final scenes, you can decipher so much about what his character has learned.\n",
      "There will be movies after parasite and before parasite. There are not enough words for me to describe a movie like this, and i'm not gonna even try.\n",
      "it's a masterpiece comes in once in every generation.\n",
      "Given the overall rating on IMDB, I was expecting something a little bit more. It's a nice idea, and well executed for the most part. The ending...hmm. Perhaps it works in Korean culture but I found it disappointing, and it seemed to me that the writer just ran out of steam.But overall worth a look. The humorous touches were great.\n",
      "After watching, I see my fight against the system (life, society, Capitalism) as a fight for all of the people who still eager for a fight.\n",
      "This movie is... memorable. I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion.\n",
      "I am flabbergasted, I went expecting so much from an Oscar winner, and my cousin has relocated to Korea and loves the country, and was left speechless. The plot is tired, the characters unlikely and I was just bored. Half the cinema had their phones out. In fact a 5 minute trip to the toilet felt like blessed relief from the tedium. I will never get that evening back. Shockingly bad.\n",
      "The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder. Seems removed from our lives, yet things start spiralling out of control, their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives. After some reflection, relatable. Who are the parasites in this society? Is it us? Or them? Or aren't we all living our lives in a cacoon, may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat. We are no better those next to us, and they to us.\n",
      "I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try.\n",
      "As director Bong Joon-ho said during his Golden Globe-speech after winning best foreign film for \"parasite\": \"Once you overcome the one-inch tall barriers of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\", and I am so happy I did. Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot, but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold.Firstly, the writing is incredible. What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty, changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected, interesting and absolutely brilliant. The pacing is on point and from start to finish, the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including, but not limited to: sadness, a feeling of well-deserved success, hapiness, guilt, unease, discomfort and fear.Secondly, the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more. For example, the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down.Finally, the ending is absolutely wonderful, although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie. After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending, but they did, and it was not what I expected. Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn't neccesarily feel right. I do however think that's the point and it brings a very intriguing point about the movie's theme into question.In short, \"Parasite\" is nothing short of a masterpiece.\n",
      "This movies is so beautifuly woven together. It's a good look at how humans seperate because of that piece of green paper called money. It shows the sadness and weight of what the poor deal with. Their lives not unimportant but treated as unimportant. It shows that education although a tool for wealth does not teach common sense or protect anyone from their safety called money. Just as the poor are not protected in their strong hunger for it. It's a mad cycle. Eye opener to look within your heart and find out the agenda of how valuable life is over money. Make sure you watch for all the beautifully done allegory's in the film.\n",
      "Honstly i never feel the need to write review but this one.. Wow i cant say anything coz it will ruin the surprise. But really , you would get out from the cinema feeling a mixture of everything.This is genius. 🙌🏻🙌🏻\n",
      "This film is Brilliant! I loved it. The portrayal of class struggles, the twists and the tense moments...amazing. This film was brilliantly executed! It is a masterpiece. If you havent seen it yet, dont wait.\n",
      "There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had.\n",
      "Best movie i've ever seen in decade, everything is so brilliant\n",

      "Made me feel depressed it was a waste of time and it overrated for no reason\n",

      "Parasite is slow to start but an enjoyable movie that takes you on a ride. It is a contender for the awards definetly and even though it won I am happy it did as I don't think there was a huge choice to be made.

      "I watched Parasite yesterday before the Oscars, and was truly disappointed. The ending just turned what could've been a great movie into a good one.\n",

      "It's a really good first half of character set up, though they themselves are never really developed, witty and fast paced, followed by a let down of a second half that doesn't deliver on its midway point revelations.\n",
      "I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.Subpar.\n",
      "Perfect. What else can you say about the wonderful film.\n",
      "Gisaengchung is an amazing film with a wonderful and strong script, amazing acting, beautiful cinematography and a great production design. The film is a comedy, a thriller and a strong drama. Parasites in two worlds, poor ones and rich ones. Rich being parasites to poor people, exploiting them and poor people getting better things from the rich using some tricks. This movie is mainly about poor people being parasites, with a strong direction. A wonderful film, a masterpiece!\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's \"Gisaengchung\" (\"Parasite\" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like \"Joker\", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw \"The Host\". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it.\n",
      "I have never seen a movie with such balance of genres, it went from a drama to romance to horror and almost a bit of every genre! i absolutely love how they slowly incorporated every family member into the rich family and just the whole storyline is pleasing and connects amazingly well. the instrumental played a huge role in its suspense and i loved it! i was constantly on the edge of my seat as the suspense was so perfect. The fact that Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park really explains the type of people Mr. Parks family were. In a dire situation, Mr. Park shut his nose because of the smell of Mr. Kim, this truly made a realization to Mr. Kim of the type of people they are. The clash of rich and poor, this clearly set Mr. Kim off, to kill him. I like the message at the end, it's very realistic. The son dreamt of buying the house to save his father, and it all would have been a happily ever after. But no, it is sadly a realistic and actual outcome of what the movie should've been. I respect it! Overall i am proud of this movies success and would watch it all over again and would still be surprised and struck by it.\n",
      "Oscars, golden globe.. I had to see why. Now I know. my english is not good enough to say anything smart :) all I can say is wow..\n",
      "My dad is someone that doesn't even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great. If thay doesn't cry out how great this film is then I don't know what.This screenplay is one of the best in a long time, incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle, the characters are all deep and compelling, the score will be stuck in my head for a long time, and the story is one to go in without knowing anything. Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite.\n",
      "The first thing that attract me about these movie was the title, it shows a type of misery about what is going to happen in the movie and what it is about, the poster also catch my attention because in the poster it show us a family with the faces behind a black band so is very intriguing for the person's that what to watch it.In the movie they present a poor family that live in misery, but a great opportunity is going to change their lives .A friend of the youngest son of the family offers him a job in a rich house because he was one of the best English speakers in the city, the poor men accepted the job and went to the house of the rich family. He quickly won the confidence of the family, and he started to enter all his family to work on the rich house, the poor father was the driver, the poor mother was the new housekeeper, and the poor sister was the art teacher. When all of this happens they realise that the house have a dark secret.In conclusión this is one of the best movies in the world, it won an Oscar for the best movie and its not a waste of time to watch it.\n",
      "Pleased for South Korean cinema it got the Oscar nod, but personally for South Korean cinema I much preferred The Handmaiden.\n",
      "As a film from thus year's contenders, I liked 1917 the most\n",
      "Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree. That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining.Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right.\n",
      "I liked this film even though I consider it overrated. There were several things that I found stupid while watching the film.The idea that someone is living in your home and you don't know it is not something new in Korean cinema. It has been explored before in Kim Ku Duk's 3-IRON.Having worked as an English teacher in Asian countries for two decades I found offensive the notion that someone with no credentials and no English skills will be able to pass off as an English teacher. Sorry folks, rich people are not that stupid.The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz. The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration. This film is nothing but pure fantasy.The ending where the daughter dies but not the son, reminded me of the ending of The Host. In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother. The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a messier finale.The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house is quite stupid and does not make any sense. It's more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film.The movie kinda fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people in this film are more likeable than the poor. You can't help rooting for the rich folks because they're the victims although if you're one of those antifa types you will most likely disagree.The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle. It has been replaced by the \"Let's Get Rich\" mentality. No matter rich or poor everyone is equally greedy, however the low class peasants are generally looked down upon not because of their origin but because of their lack of taste.\n",
      "So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is...What am going to tell you, those who didn't watch it yet..Please don't. Please don't waist your time on this BS.\n",
      "No Plot, no acting, no music, no dialogs, no nothing.What was it? Oscars winner? Were they kidding? :(\n",
      "With one of the most staggering turns in movie history, the stakes in what was already an extremely tense moment rose to an unprecedented level. The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.With a finely crafted script, true emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen. Parasite will stick with me for a long time.\n",
      "This is a brilliant movie, just watch it without reading too many reviews, you won't regret it.\n",
      "This movie was freaking amazing!! On top of the genius commentary on class in developed countries and all the nuances it uses in that story, it is absolutely gorgeous. Every shot is piece of art, the editing and visuals are gorgeous and powerful in their symbolism. Plus the score is so so beautiful and emotional, you feel the tension in every moment. The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel \"how did I get here\" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie. It more than meets the mark in every aspect. I would recommend it to almost anyone.\n",
      "I don't even know what to say. In fact, I don't even want to say anything about this movie. Just go see it if you haven't. You'll be glad you did.\n",
      "Will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Worthy of ever award and accolade that comes its way.\n",
      "Best Picture well deserved. Thank you Bong, very cool.\n",
      "Parasite is a very enjoyable film. There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film.\n",
      "I thought that it is kind of black joke things. Satirizing the polarization, poverty or bad condition of society is the things that i had imagined befrore i saw the movie. Did you also expect that? My answer is it'll never happen.After the movie i feel like someone punch my head, and then i feel so bad at something that ican't explain what exactly it is.Highly recommeded to see it.\n",
      "Every frame of this movie is a film diploma itself .. Surely one of the best movies in last 10 years\n",
      "This is the first time i have ever seen such a good Asia film like that! You will not regret if you pay some money to see that\n",
      "With many other films out there pointing out of the problem of wealth gap and the struggle to survive in cities, Parasite stands out being different because of its comedic effects and the sudden twists.\n",
      "There are so many moments in the first half you can laugh with ease when the family use their wits to resolve problems. But under that surface, there is pressure building up, and the dark finally emerges from the most grand-looking house. I was awed by the sudden twist.\n",
      "The cinematic effect is great. I was surprised to know that the mansion was purposely 'built' for this film. There are so many details that portrays the 'bitter-sweet' life of the struggling family.\n",
      "I was reluctant to watch this. I could see from the trailer that it has good production value, yet I was worried it would be too weird, being a Korean/an Asian language thriller. Eventually I did watch it and I am glad! I'm also glad it won all those Oscars.The blend of dark comedy in this social thriller definitely attributed to an enjoyable and entertaining experience and made me more engaged with the story. It is very well made and it deals with various interesting subjects/issues of our society, all in the premise of a collision of social classes (extreme poverty with extreme wealth).\n",
      "The comparison of the poor Kim family to parasites is not clear from the beginning. Their underground \"apartment\" does stink and yes, bad enough, they have to look at a drunken guy pee in front of them during dinner. No job, no hope, no direction, the bland and quiet acceptance of their status quo at the beginning makes me wonder how they resonate with the film title.However, step by step, through perfect acting schemes, the well thought out ploys, they make a dream of living off of the Parks come true, thereby transforming themselves into parasites. Throughout the period when they enjoy the \"improving\" living standards: from eating in the dungeon to a treat dinner with the drivers, to the actual pizzas whose boxes they were making to earn bread and butter, etc. All this time I struggle with the heartbreaking fact that at least three parties (1) the Parks (2) the previous driver (3) the previous maid were all innocently suffering from the Kims' wrongdoing. The lack of apologetic thinking is absolutely horrifying. Yet when the class difference is so drastic, I am not sure whether they are too be judged. After all what other options do they have, without a morally sound means to access anything else other than their smelly dungeon? It only became more intense when the previous maid showed her true parasitic self, together with her husband.\"Money is an almighty iron that straightens out all wrinkles\" - on the surface yes, but it is exactly this dangerous, monotonic pursuit of money, and money only, that has cost three families their chance to make peace with what is given.\"People with money are always nice.\" It sounds almost absurd and I can think of millions of counterexamples, yet the director sets the story up exactly this way in the film. I think I dare thinking outside of the film context, it is rather that \"the people who do not have money sometimes cannot afford to be nice.\" Either way, when the cutoff of wealth is base-line subsistence, it is clear that dignity is at risk.What is the dad's plan? It sounds like a family who are so good at planning \"scenes\" to act out in fact have not a clue about planning long term for their lives. Is planning also out of reach for a lot of the poor? It turns a bit positive when the boy sets himself a goal to one day make enough money to buy that mansion, but is that enough? Or is it rather another episode of self-deceiving wishful thinking only?\n",
      "This is my firsy review ..to be hones I am very proud to write my first review for this incredible movie .. No words can describe it . The crew the filming the story .. Wow Korea give us a great hope and open to us a big door after a lot of disappointments in Hollywood this year ... I want to give it 10/10 but I have problem with ending .. it make me a little bit disappointed at the first I think the movie have a great message that says '' every dollar you pay today tommorow in future you will get it'' but the ending destroyed this quote .. at all thx for this great masterpiece 👏🏻👏🏻\n",
      "This movie is pure art. The subtle theme becomes entangled with the characters' lives and relationships. Must watch. i give 9/10 because this movie made me sad , its a education for us not an entertainment . as education i would give 10/10\n",
      "as an Entertainment 9/10 for me . anyway its a must watch for everyone .\n",
      "One of the most over rated movie of all time. It was good and one time watch movie but not worth all the hype it good because of being a foreign movie and people want to appreciate it but the appreciation went too far. And it got the awards like oscars because of less competition.\n",
      "I so wanted to love this given the reviews I have heard but I was left wondering what film other people had seen. Idea was good but it was a nothing story in the end. So disappointed. Found the subtitles too small. Just could not have cared less. Why all the hype?\n",
      "A fantastic film that holds your attention from the first frame to the last. I was totally captivated by the story and the cast did an amazing jobs of creating memorable characters. Loved the twists in the plot and the feeling that the photography gave. An excellent piece of work! Bravo!\n",
      "This film is full of symbolism that gives it amazing rewatchability. It meshes heist, humor, and horror genres incredibly well all while delivering important social commentary.\n",
      "Very suspense and dark humour are glamorously seen. Acting are superb. What a masterpiece. Well deserved Oscar 👍\n",
      "Hi At first glance at the movie It looks simple But I sink deep into the film Throughout the film, one looks at the power of thinking and the power of man himself But wealth is everything And poverty incapacity Thanks\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, it's ok, but the critic and user reviews are truly astounding. It's spoken about like it's some marvel of cinema, when in reality is a mediocre story, heavily laden with obvious \"social and financial injustice\".It'll pass an afternoon, it won't stay with you forever.\n",
      "I thought it was a well made film, decent twist at the end but it's no where near as much of a \"masterpiece\" as some fanboys are making it out it be.\n",
      "Despite its social commentary and clever cinematography, this movie is still kinda cliche, with predictable and forced plots, with cringeworthy acting here and there.BTW, Bong Joon Ho = Ki Woo, Hollywood = Park family.\n",
      "A surprisingly interesting film. I absolutely did not expect such a plot. I put off watching for a long time, but when I decided, I never regretted it.\n",
      "Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) is directed and written by Bong Joon Ho. It is a thriller that tells the story of a poor, Lower class family that slowly worm their way into the household of a rich, upper class family. One by one the family get hired to do a job, with the employers unaware that they are a family. Things take an unexpected turn in the third act and I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the way that this movie ended up. I really enjoyed Parasite and in my opinion, it deserves the Academy Awards that it won.\n",
      "Good movie to watch when u are boring\n",
      "Really recommended!!\n",
      "Problem with Bong's movies is that they have very strong message. Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say.\n",
      "I do think this was a very good movie. Honestly I would love to rate the movie higher. Like the title says, it was a 10/10 until the very ending. I loved the characters and the set designs. The dialogue was very well scripted and the acting was great. Everything leading up to the very intense crescendo of the party and the stabbings was beautifully done. It was a slow burn that kept you guessing about what would happen. Again, I think this is an excellent movie. The only reason for my opinion that it's only a 7/10 is because at the very ending the movie basically says, hey just work hard for a couple of years and then you can get out of poverty... just a short couple of years and all your dreams come true. I guess I feel like the very ending made the rest of the movie feel kinda pointless. Maybe the was the intention? Just my opinion here.\n",
      "Besides it is a huge narrative, it is also a really politic picture. Easily the best movie in 2019 and one of the most important film of the decade.\n",
      "Not my cup of tea. Farce combined with excessive violence, and lots of plot holes as well as character inconsistencies, but what do I know?\n",
      "Now this isn't a bad movie, not at all. Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film.\n",
      "This movie is phenomenal, it's epic, exciting, funny, has the awesome ultra-violent in the third act of the movie, it's so unique and powerful that it's so cool! This movie is just a masterpiece, and however hates it is just weird, because it's perfect in any way you look at!\n",
      "After watching the Oscars I was curious about Parasite and knew I would have to watch it. I wasn't disappointed at all, most times when people hype something up I tend to think it's overrated. I was rooting for this down on their luck family even though they were technically committing a crime. Who hasn't lied on a resume to get a job ? I didn't see the ending coming at all so that was a shock.\n",
      "Best movie for greedy people. One should not so greedy that after sometime he fall down on his own net.\n",
      "A slow paced thriller that highlights the social class divide... superbly directed and esp a powerful development of characters... a great movie with little disappointing conclusion...\n",
      "Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great Amazing movie, just watch it! So many emotions, so many great.\n",
      "While I do think that it is ever so slightly overrated, I can't help but acknowledge the very artistic directing, symbolism, and acting that went into this film. Some parts make you laugh, some parts make you feel very sympathetic, and many parts make you feel oddly uncomfortable but in a good way that makes the movie pretty enjoyable! We definitely do live in different parts of society with different luxuries and experiences that are misunderstood by the other.\n",
      "It's not a bad movie, it's a good perspective on society and what money creates. But I couldn't agree less with Oscar for best motion picture, come on, so good movies in 2019! WTF Hollywood?\n",
      "Great movie lived up to all of the hype, definitely a must see👍\n",
      "Parasite 6/10... very well made movie but is it the first Korean movie the academy have seen??!\n",
      "The oscars throwing best international movie, best director, best screenplay and best motion picture at this movie just goes to prove my theory that the Academy are so out of touch and so desperately want to appear \"woke\" and this action by them is just an insult to all the great Korean movies that have come before this and all the other great movies released in the last year.\n",
      "For me this was an above average South Korean movie but everyone latched onto it as some kind of miracle of modern cinema... Meh academy, meh!\n",
      "Agreed, an interesting, original and twisted story. Here and there bits of social criticism but overall way too constructed for my taste. Ultimately I didn't get the hype and glowing reviews, leave alone true wow moments.\n",
      "First off, what an achievement, the Academy don't like to budge easily in their traditional ways so being the first non-English speaking best picture winner is extremely impressive. Very well deserved too.\n",
      "The film itself is fascinating. I've never watched something that dips into so many genres, it manages them all brilliantly in its own chaotic way. I especially enjoyed the thrilling/dramatic moments and the humour. The family had both my sympathy and my frustration, they were dreadful throughout most of the film but you could argue only as a product of the world they find themselves living in. The film dives deep into the extreme ends of society and it is fascinating viewing how they collide. Highlights include when Mr Park complains of the smell, showing his true colours despite him being nice enough externally. Special mention to Mrs Park who's naivety and obliviousness was very believable.\n",
      "The ending was excellent and I somehow found myself rooting for the family once again.\n",
      "Overall, a true masterpiece.\n",
      "Don't be put off by the subtitles!!\n",
      "I regret not seeing this in cinemas when this was out. This deeply disturbing and tense story of a family infiltrating another home only to have it slowly unfold into disaster was gripping.I particularly thought the theme of water acting as s symbol for the escalation on the situation was incredibly well executed, starting off with a trickle of urine, before turning into a bottle of water, and then a bucket, and then a flood, ending in still river over the course of the film. I thought that was well done especially when you consider the flood is sewage water and it is destroying their basement apartment. The cinematography alone in this seen was astounding, with the shot of the flooded bathroom and Ki-Jung sat on top of an overflowing elevated toilet, smoking as the rest of the family home is ruined being a particular highlight.The first half almost feels like a heist movie with horribly corrupt intentions, before everything comes crumbling down just as the family become comfortable.If this ever gets a re release in cinemas I will absolutely go. This deserved the best picture award that it received and was probably the best film I saw this year (despite it being released in 2018 and my viewing being in 2020).\n",
      "I would not rate this as the \"Best Movie of the Century \" like some hyperbolic reviewers. But. It is excellent and very well done. The story keeps you engaged throughout. I would rate even higher, but I thought the ending did not live up to the quality of the story which led up to it. Nonetheless, no arguments here about its status as the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the year. It probably deserves that title.\n",
      "Ngl this do be kinda lit. I really like the dynamic the family has with each other, and I love the contrast between the poor family with the misery they live through and the rich family with their perfect and happy lives.\n",
      "The movie is definitely well made and has a good twisted ending but to be honest, it is nothing special. I watched it because of so many great reviews and awards and while I loved the slick way it moved instead of being slow - I have watched enough such movies in Indian cinema to know that it is not a masterpiece.\n",
      "Not gonna lie, the Overrated-ness of Parasite is starting to get to me. When I first saw it at the cinema I was very impressed, but after some thought I think it's probably closer to an 8 objectively. The last 30 minutes in particular drag it down somewhat. Not really a huge fan of the direction it takes. I simply don't get what on God's Green Earth made this one of the highest rated movies of all-time on some websites and listings. It's pretty baffling and far from being a flawless movie. That being said, I still like it. The Black and White Version added nothing to it though. If anything it made it pretentious for absolutely no reason.7.5/10.\n",
      "Cannot understand why it can win important award???\n",
      "What a shame Parasite won the Oscars instead of 1917.\n",
      "I was expected a masterpiece and felt really disappointed. It is like watching 2 different movies. Second half too surrealistic for my taste\n",
      "It took some years for me to finally see this movie and I'm still not sure how to place it.The most important thing about this movie is its message.It's about the Kim family living their harsh life in South Korea as they are without a job and without any perspective. On the opposite there is the Park Family living a privileged life in their luxurious home.By coincidence both lives get tangled up and there are apparently two worlds colliding. The story is very witty and the movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dark but never boring.For me this movie is quite entertaining but not that mind-blowing as some might think.\n",
      "This is a well-made film but is far from achieving masterpiece status, and those who are capriciously throwing that word around must be cinematically starved. To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film's screenplay is definitely intriguing, character development is sorely lacking, along with any kind of memorable performances. Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another \"Green Book\" cop out. I'm also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity, a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests. Good film? Yes!! Masterpiece and Best Picture of The Year? Absolutely Not!! And we might as well just do away with the foreign film category now that this boundary no longer seems to mean anything.\n",
      "All I thought about was I wanna be rich, I wanna have a girl like Da-hye until the birthday party of Da-song.\n",
      "It's all about the Kims' desperation. They are struggling to live but it seems they are fated to live in that semibasement.\n",
      "It would be better if some scenes can be more dramatic.\n",
      "I see people really raving over the film and the awards it won, so I was keen to see it, sounded great. And it was great until about two thirds through when the ending kicks in.The ending was just so-so, seemed to build up to a crescendo and then the plot let the actors down.\n",
      "To quote director, Bong Joon Ho, \"I'd like to say as little as possible here, because the film is best when you go into it cold.\" That being said, this picture has it all, drama, suspense, mystery and thrills. It has an effective slow build that culminates to a tension filled conclusion.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho Is No Stranger To Masterfull Storytelling And Directing And Eversince He Made \" Memories of Murder \" (Which Is An Amazing Film) He Has Been Uping His Own Game. The Directing In This Film Is One Word Superb.

      "Just saw it, blown away like everyone else. As I walked out the theater door I started reading the film reviews that I'd been avoiding in order to dodge spoilers. I was met with yet another shock:\n",
      "Instead of finding others peeling their jaws off the pavement at the miracle of Bong's ingenious and politically powerful satire of a satire film, all the reviews seem to stop at ground level (maybe half-basement run-down 1960s Seoul apartment level-- you'll understand that if you've seen the film,) and they never 'cross the line' to descend into the full-on hidden underground BUNKER level of what Bong is doing with this film.\n",
      "I'm reading review after review, all authored by viewers smug that they were sharp enough to deduce the film's 'subtle commentary' on 'economic inequality' and ''the evils of consumerism.'\n",
      "WHAT? Idiots! That commentary was NOT subtle. It was obvious to the point of being ridiculous. Bong has made fools of you, although I don't think that was his ultimate intention. He made use of the satire genre to throw fresh light on another subject, and it's a subject that has been overdone by everyone, especially westerners, in the arts, in international politics, in every possible aspect: It's that whole pesky North/South thing that all 77 million KOREANS, north and south, have to deal with.\n",
      "In support of this, there are dozens of scenes worth citing. But the most glaringly obvious one is crazy little DaSong's backyard overnight during a brutal rainstorm. He's in a mini-teepee (he's obsessed w/ US 'indians,' who are used as code for 'americans' throughout the film) w/his floodlight & walkie-talkie. His parents are sitting on the couch in their grand living room watching his antics through the huge window that frames their backyard like a big-screen TV.Dad: 'Do you think that tent will keep the storm out?'\n",
      "Mom: We had it made by americans, so we should be fine....'\n",
      "I'm sorry, that backyard IS the DMZ, with its floodlights and speakers. The kid is the 'crossing line' between N. and S. Korea. During the brutal murder scene @ the climax of the film, the guest tables for the 'party' are laid out like combat lines around the DMZ 'teepeet' that was 'made in america' so 'we'll be safe.'And the whole scene @ the b-day party when Park, Sr. is instructing Driver Kim, (both wearing american native headdresses) on the 'role' he is supposed to play in the fight scene they're staging around the teepee....never has an actual Native American man been cast to play a Hollywood role where he looked more like an american stereotype than Kang Ho Song did in the scene where the camera paused on his sad/irate face in that ridiculous headdress. Kang Ho Song's character represents THE AVERAGE KOREAN, not north, not south, that has succeeded @ living through the last 600 yrs of Korean history. At the end of the film, he's a KOREAN, who just needs to 'walk up the stairs' (or, 'cross the DMZ line') into the world South Koreans are making for themselves now that they're economically capable of 'buying the (national) house.'I swear I could write a 300 pg thesis on this film, but I'll just leave it at this: since Bong won the Oscars, N Korea's 'dear leader' Kim Jung weasel has used the film as propaganda supporting the idea that South Koreans have been forced into capitalism by 'americans' and would really prefer to be like supposedly less consumerist N. Koreans. There's therefore an EXCELLENT chance that at least some form of the film will be widely viewed in North Korea. And Bong is hoping that North Koreans will, unlike western reviewers, be smart enough to deduce the REAL content of his message.\n",

      "I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I was echanted with every twist and turn this movie presented. The pacing and shifts in the storyline melded together beautifully to create a captivating film. This movie is an instant classic that I could watch again and again. Wonderful and fun movie!\n",
      "Don't believe the hype. This a a good movie don't get me wrong. It's well made and keeps you interested for most of it. But it completely unravels in the ending where it just seemed rushed to finish it. It reminded me of Game of Thrones where they didn't know how to wrap it up.\n",
      "A well deserved best picture. A really unique storyline that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. I am not sure I've ever seen a movie that I'd classify as a comediac-horror-thriller but in a way Parasite was.I loved the setting, love how it was shot and the dialogue was incredibleThe only reason I'm not ranking this higher is because I didn't like the dad killing the boss. I don't think the storyline ever built that up properly and it bothers me.\n",
      "Crime doesn't pay. Just ask the sociopathic poor Kim family featured in the dark tale PARASITE, an overrated, B/B- slasher film dressed up as high art: the latest runway walk sporting the Emperor's new clothes.First the perps hoodwink a nice wealthy family, taking out the nice poor chauffeur and loyal kind poor housekeeper along the way, then make life a living hell for a third nice family. Ouch. Don't get in this ruthless mean family's way or you'll be sorry.I am.I liked the movie's opening shot. Painterly. Black writing appears on the right window pane of the Kim family's semi-basement hovel. For a while, everything was going OK. I liked the first act. Then WTF. Talk about bad choices. What an artistic, intellectual, sense-and-sensibility nose dive.Tough to give this harsh and disappointing mean-spirited flick higher than a 7. Because even if I give it a 7 for FORM (nice production values, acting, and visuals, but an achievement of FORM at best only slightly better than the architectural quality of the deluxe modernesque house that PARASITE features as the main stage set of its story), I can't give the movie's STORY more than a 6.Which averages a FORM & STORY score of 6.5.That's about where it left me when I left the theater: pleased on an emotional and artistic level about 6.5, a bad taste in my mouth, feeling played. But at least I know what all the hyperventilating groupthink hype's about.But then the filmmaker didn't give himself the awards. The overblown fanfare isn't his fault. He just wrote, directed, and made the best movie he could.And a 6.5 isn't a bad score or in any way derogatory in my book, especially for a story that feels like a stage play more than a motion picture. For me, any movie that gets a 7 is darn good.So. Enjoy. See PARASITE over and over if it's your cuppa tea and you find the movie relevant to your life, your vision of the world, your artistic aspirations and work. Different strokes for different folks.But here's the thing: Actually, all we know for sure is that PARASITE may not have been--and most likely wasn't--the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' first choice for Best Picture but somehow still managed to eke out a win for that misleading category. PARASITE may have merely been the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' second and third place choice for Best Picture, thanks to the complex \"preferential ballot system\" (Google it), pushing PARASITE over the top to KO works that may have gotten more first place votes.How else can we characterize this non-transparent balloting paradigm, based on non-disclosure of the balloting results, than Fakery Afoot?Or to steal a line from THE GENTLEMEN, \"F*%@ery Afoot.\"The Academy won't tell us the truth. How many first place votes did PARASITE get? How many first place votes did the other 8 nominated movies get? Why won't the academy show us the math?We can handle the truth.Instead, the Academy treats us like sheep, preferring to keep us in the dark, misleading us, relying on our gullibility and the necessary illusion (as they see it, in their screwed up marketing way) that PARASITE was the top vote getter for #1 film.Maybe.But unlikely.I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.Truth be told, who knows (other than The Academy's Threshold Guardians) how many other so-called Best Picture award winners since 2009, when the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to as many as 10, won an award not for what we're led to believe, Best Picture, but for a category that would be more accurately named Top Consensus Picture.Or, oxymoronically (and moronically), Top Second and Third Place Picture.Or how about Most Preferred Picture.Academy Awards are a self-promotional corporate crap shoot, fueled by politics, social trends, self-interest, personal biases, PR, hidden agendas, mass mind meld, and money. PARASITE simply reflects the latest Academy enabled intellectually dishonest connection between the secret and screwy preferential balloting system results and the name of the award--the fake connection between what goes on behind the curtain and what goes on in front of the curtain in the merry land of Oz.In other words, to use an analogy: Like our federal elections for President, the Best Picture award doesn't go to the popular vote winner. The award goes to the Electoral College winner. But in our elections for President, though we might not like the set up and feel it's unfair, at least we know how the system works, it's fully disclosed, and the vote tallies do not remain behind closed doors.My hunch?PARASITE, true to the meaning of the word, ironically enough, benefited by deriving nutrients at the expense of other movies.I suspect that PARASITE landed the award for Top Consensus Picture/Most Preferred Picture not by leading in the number of first place votes but by siphoning off lots of second and third and maybe even fourth and fifth place votes, thereby outflanking films of more surpassing quality like LITTLE WOMEN (8.0) and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (8.75).Again, I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.I don't know which force-feeds us a bigger Monster In The House, PARASITE or The Academy of Motion Pictures.At least PARASITE's ugly monster roams the house out in the open.(Aside: For Best International Film, PARASITE oddly beat out the brilliantly written, shot, and acted, truly modern and original, artistically and socially astute no-false-note gritty LES MISERABLES (8.5). I haven't yet seen Almodovar's PAIN AND GLORY, also nominated for Best International Film, but I'm guessing I'll like that more than PARASITE too. And, by the way, how did the Academy manage to overlook the remarkable unnominated edge-of-your-seat film-wonder UNCUT GEMS (8.5)--too cutting edge? Not good enough to make the empty 10 slot? Really? And you got robbed Adam Sandler.)PARASITE not only trots its monster, the downtrodden Kim family, out in the open, painting the family with a thin brush, hiding nothing, and therefore leaving little if anything surprising to foreshadow, reveal, or shock us about their inner life, history, motivations and what makes them tick besides inept pizza box folding, manipulation, high jinks, and greed.PARASITE also does another thing really well, which goes hand-in-glove with the story's two-dimensional nefarious family. PARASITE reminds us that pressure reveals character--and the arc of the parasitic self-serving Kim family's character is simple.None.Nasty family starts out F'd and poor. Nasty family hits the jackpot through fakery and fraud but hits a snag. Nasty family turns violent then becomes poor again and more F'd than before.Unrepentant.Unchanged.And all an empty way for the filmmaker to set us up for some nasty, gratuitous horror and gore.I was almost ready to accept the poor family's mooching off the rich family as an inspired metaphor for capitalism mooching off society, doing whatever it takes, including lie, cheat, steal, smile, swindle, and kill, to parasitically feast off our commonwealth.But then capitalism wouldn't likely end up back in the basement............One final thought. PARASITE tells a story about rich and poor that goes beyond the obvious economic one.The story takes place mostly inside of a house. A house is a metaphor for human character: Character is a house. You have your interior and exterior. I speak as an architect when I say that in terms of the quality of architectural design, the house has a rich, developed interior but a poor, undeveloped exterior. And I speak as a screenwriter when I say it's the opposite for the quality of the character design: PARASITE's characters have a rich, developed exterior but a poor, undeveloped interior. They are little more than paper-thin characterizations.The movie's building architecture and character architecture are reciprocally related, creating a kind of symmetry, conflict, clash but not a pleasing kind--because in Story Architecture, what matters most isn't the quality of the stage set design but the quality of the character design. And that's where PARASITE fails most glaringly as a work of art.The filmmaker created a monster, patching together a subpar exterior building architecture and subpar interior character architecture to create a FORM & STORY 6.5 Frankenstein.\n",
      "The Rich. And the Poor. In this one the poor family is neither fighting for their rights nor are they fighting for their future. They try to go along as the parasites of a rich family. I guess, this script shows perfectly, how a saturated generation X sees the stereotype of poor people in today's times. Nothing to like in this movie. The story is inhuman in every sense.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho delivers an engaging film that continues to get more engaging by the minute and lives up to and exceeds it's hype. The story goes from funny to thrilling to dark in the 132 minutes of a genius plot.\n",
      "The movie was so good. They was really successful about their roles -even children too-.About the scenario;\n",
      "The main family was very clever and skillful. When they to deceive the host women and men, they were like a fox. Especially, Jung (the sister) was planning everything and the other family members was so successful about doing what she planned.My best part is when they runaway from home after the host family coming home. It's was so dangerous, mom and dad could see them when they going from under the table. In this scene even i was strained.So i mean they are deserve whatever they got (like awards :) )\n",
      "This is a film you either love or despise due to its portrayal of social desperation. If you don't like this film you may have missed many artistic cinematographic aspects related to the whole story and the subliminal messages within it about an unfair elitist society. It can be considered a grotesque film that keeps you watching and expectant of the unexpected till the end, which is so thrilling because it combines the sublime with horror at the same time. As Nolan implied in Inception, one more time, we come across with a film that incite us to be chasers not of dreams but of our own reality, in this case, at any cost.\n",
      "This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! It's one of the best of the year!\n",
      "If Parasite would have come 5-6 years ago, it would have walked out of the Dolby Theater with just a single win in the foreign category and it would have burned my heart. I mean if you can't go beyond that cliched appreciation (of the best foreign-language film), despite touching such high artistic note of story-telling. And that too, just because of a mild language barrier and the politically driven format of Academy and other award shows, as a matter of fact.\n",
      "First half of the movie was really boring. Second half was kinda interesting though. An the ending was really really bad for my opinion. The other thing that was annoying is that the actors over played at times and the worse of all was the actor who played the boss lady . She was over playing and it was really annoying. I don't know if those were the directions but I did not like it at all.\n",
      "In conclusion not an Oscar worth movie, not a masterpiece...\n",
      "I liked Parasite very much and had predicted that it would win the Oscar for best foreign language film - as it rightfully did !However, I could never have imagined that Parasite would also win in the best picture category as well. Shouldn't the Academy's eligibility rules permit a film to enter in only ONE of these two categories ? ? ?\n",
      "My impressions are following:It is quite dragged. (Despite being curious about how everything is gonna end we had to stop and watch the last 30ish minutes of the movie the next day. I was not sleepy, just fed up with watching it.)The major flaw in the plot, as I see it, is that 4 extremely capable and adaptable people are living in an basement, starving and struggling to survive. Another thing is that the husband of the first housekeeper would have died starving in the bunker, without even attempting to go out and get himself some food, despite the fact he was not locked in, if his wife had not showed up after many days to check up on him, finding him all weak and hungry. And how did Chung-sook manage to clear all the mess so that the Parks did not notice anything if not when they arrived then when they woke up in the morning?The movie has quite a suspenseful plot, nicely done, but asides from that it is just not entertaining enough. And here I found myself divided, on one side really wanting to see what is going to happen, and on the other side just dying from boredom because despite of all of the happenings it is simply just not entertaining.As for the cinematography, I liked the movie. It is nicely filmed, nothing spectacular, but fitting and suitable to the plot. I especially liked the flood scene when Ki-jeong is sitting on the toilet, that was hyper-realistic and remarkable.Altogether, okayish, I would give it a 7-star rating.\n",
      "I watched the film without any knowledge of anyone's critic or rating. I got into the interesting plot of the beginning with much more curiosity for the direction it could drive me to. However, I was disapointed when blood began to flow everywhere unnecessarily, without serving any purpose. I am not a Tarantino's fan, that's for sure. In the end I could not realize if class struggle or social inequality aspects of our society should be told on screen in such a confusing way. Or was it simply a flat thriller? I did not quite get it. Surely overrated though.\n",
      "Fantastic movie, I really liked it. History, script, actors, it was really a very good work.\n",
      "Theme of the movie is unmatched. An experience of division between classes.\n",
      "Bringing reality so subtly onto the screen.\n",
      "I didn't know what to expect nor did I have any expectations. This is brilliantly written, acted and directed. The viewer gets sucked into thinking it's a comedy, then there are subtle messages in the beginning that turn dark, then the entire scenario changes and it's nothing like you expected. I love when a movie takes you to places you didn't see coming and this does exactly that. I haven't seen anything like this in a very long time and this will be a classic. It deserves all the awards and acclaim. Just brilliant.\n",
      "Orange beast and his supporters can stay fuming! Best Picture lol.\n",
      "I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides.\n",
      "But they killed my girl jessica so im gonna have to give it a 9/10\n",
      "Good if you don't watch the last part of the movie.\n",
      "I don't know what the fuss is all about this movie. After I watched the Oscars and to my surprise an Asian film lifting the top prize left me puzzled and at the same time very much excited. I immediately downloaded it and saw it in the middle of the night, the very same day. I won't say it's no good. It is brilliant but Oscar brilliant!!!! That's doubtful.Our society is not equal and it can never be. That's the fact and we have to live with it. Just imagine a predator and a prey playing equal in mother nature. Chaotic, right?Very well cinematographed, written, directed and acted but it was just unbelievable to always see rich guys play dumb and easily gullible. They are not like that. And poor and hungry always menacing, opportunistic type which is also stereotypical. Oscars is all about breaking the stereotype but the train has derailed I guess. So disappointed. There were a lot of films better then this one.\n",
      "OK movie. Don't really see why people are claiming that it the director is always one step ahead. I personally felt that it was unrealistic and therefore had little sympathy for both sides of society.\n",
      "Wth??!! It's absolutely bad, the movie is boring, pure fantasy, like science fiction movie, I think it's like a someone smoke a big one and make and boring, fanciful and idealistic movie...\n",
      "This is a kind of a movie where you can never be disappointed. It is funny, it is ironic, it is still obsessing me\n",
      "Such a perfect mirage of spoiled and discriminated minds and society we are living in.\n",
      "I watched this film last night, just before the night when it woukd win 3 oscars. I can understand why it did win, though personally I can not say that I was blown away by it.\n",

      "Bong Joon-ho is a genius, and this movie is a masterpiece. That's it!\n",
      "First half of the movie was okay, second half was much better. Overall it is very good movie. Great story not so great executed.\n",
      "Because they are totally a very deceptive and cunning persons.It's a very good movie, but too bad.... for me it seems the movie is telling that one can be as worst as possible yet still can escape from justice if he/she is clever enough.And on the other side, at the same time this movie is also telling to the rich people not to be so naive and kind to their staffs. Just be careful and don't put 100% trust to their staffs.I don't understand as some said that they are not villains because they are poor?Anyway, again... This movie is sooo good, worth to watch. Scene by scene are all interesting except the ending.\n",
      "I wish I could give a thousand stars. This is a masterpiece and a love letter to cinema.\n",
      "It's hard to define the genre of this movie. It starts as a subtle and enjoyable comedy before veering into overdone goriness. Reminded me of Chinese cinema of the 70ies. The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors (cfr. Burning from Chang-dong Lee) : the abusive crossing of social class lines... Too bad for the ending. My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too. Still the movie is good and enjoyable.\n",
      "For some reason the UK only got Parasite in cinemas in February so I've only just got the chance to see it. It's a great piece of filmmaking all around with great performances and a fantastic script.\n",
      "This is the first movie that can take me places, from comedy to drama to romance to action to thriller to horror to all the combination that grips me speechless at the end of it. I watched it three times and it feels as great every time. Camera works are very structured, scenes are orchestrated almost mathematically they fill my heart so right. Acting is evenly of quality, no one outshines anyone else. Superb!\n",
      "I normally do not watch subtitle movies yet the reviews, awards, and comments from friends had me curious. I am thrilled I saw it. Not sure what to make of it. Acting and photography was grand. I know I will watch it again. I missed parts of the subtitles because they went by too fast. I got the gist so I allowed it to play through. Rented it through Apple TV, watched it in the comfort of our home 😎\n",
      "One of best crime/thriller i've watched. I can't guess where the plot will bring me, every minute in the movie i tried to guess but mostly i wrong, and got the unexpected, even the ending. Every character really has strong impact in the movie, and you must pay attention about every little detail they do, because that builds up the story, and has really deep meaning for the story. The movie itself is masterpiece, really worth watching.\n",
      "Not just a movie it's beautiful like a painting every scene, every shot, every moment is breathtaking and background score is apt and haunting....Bong Joon ho is the man\n",
      "Bit of a mazza throughout cannot lie. Mazza at the start, big mazza middle, mega mazza end. Overall, top mazza\n",
      "Perhaps it is a \"dark comedy\" that is \"hysterically funny\" as some reviewers wrote. Well, for me it ain't so. The pure nastiness and bloodletting in this movie reminds me of Fargo, which I loved but didn't find funny either. Come to think of it, this movie could have been written by the Coen brothers. It is very long and ultra creepy and I left the movie feeling slightly sick, kinda the way I felt after watching the Dutch version of the movie \"The Vanishing\".\n",
      "Is it a good movie? In terms of story telling, imagery, and acting, I suppose it is. Should you see it, expecting a good laugh? Definitely no! Even \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is funnier than this movie. Want to laugh? Go see \"Mr. Hulot's Holiday.\"\n",
      "I do not understand the insane hype surrounding this movie. It was good. Just good. I'm a big Bong Joon Ho fan. And I get what he was going for here. Social commentary/satire with finesse. But he missed the mark with this one. This was no masterpiece, as almost everyone is calling it. Joon Ho did make a masterpiece. It just wasn't \"Parasite\". It was \"Okja\". Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse.\n",
      "As far as \"Parasite\", like I said, it was just good. What keeps it from being great, in my opinion, is the fact that there were no likable characters. I didn't care at all about any of them. Big miss. There were many glaring plot holes, but I could have overlooked those if he had given me just one character to root for.It's like eating at a high end restaurant where nothing on the menu looks appealing to you. Disappointment. All of these 10 star reviews are just hive-mind on display.\n",
      "One of the best movies I have ever seen. It teaches a lot about things we spot in everyday life. Movie starts from comedy to thriller.\n",
      "Doesn't take much to please people nowadays! I don't buy the deep, multi-layered metaphorical masterpiece others talk about. It was a fairly simplistic commentary (given the runtime) on social class tensions.That's it. Interesting plot but I feel it could have been delivered in a much more captivating way. I found the pace excruciating after a while once I understood the general message. Wasted opportunity.Those giving it a 10 are not on this planet.\n",
      "This movie even made me lose trust in all Oscars awards and IMDB ratings,We've watched it as a family and we all hate it and regret the time wasted on it.\n",
      "This movie is fantastic!The name of the film pertains to our \"main characters\" in the film as well as two others we meet later on.There's a lot going on for this film in terms of the political and societal commentary it utilizes. We see with the opening the setup of this, as the main family is impoverished and is literally living at the lowest level without being underground. They struggle to retain what most would consider basic necessity nowadays like wifi, and do odd jobs to regain that and have a simple meal.Fortune strikes though as their son gets an in with a rich family to tutor their young daughter, eventually working their way deeper inside until all four are working different jobs for this family.All this is achieved because the mother is easily manipulated and prefers recommendations when bringing workers into their home, rather than documentation. This ties into the difference between classes.However, our main families newfound means of financial potential is put in jeopardy one night when the former house cleaner returns. She rings incessantly, needing to retrieve something in the basement. Which we find out is her husband, revealing the main family is not the first to get an in with the rich family. Her husband had actually been living there for years to escape loan sharks, and was receiving food and residency unbeknownst to the family above.The raised issue of these two different families leeching from the wealthier comes to a head when the rise is discovered by the former housekeeper. She and her husband are subdued and shortly after our family, save for the mother, is able to sneakily escape.This leads to a brilliant scene of our family descending back into poverty. Going lower, and lower, showing just how different these two worlds are. I loved this scene. It was so clearly thought out, and it brilliantly enacted.There's so much to love about this film and it deserves so much of the praise it's been getting. It's clear that Bong Joon-Ho is passionate about the work he does. Definitely give this a watch, its worth your time and money.\n",
      "Your intrest, your excitement builds in every scene. One of the best screenplay. This was my first Korean movie to watch and it stole me.\n",
      "I loved this movie. I was laughing almost the whole time and when I wasn't, I was holding my hand over my mouth with surprise. Every twist and turn of the story is paced and delivered. Every character is spot on.I love a film with a message, and this one is loud and clear.You should watch it. I don't care that it's in Korean, you should watch it.\n",
      "Loved this Film from Start to End! The Parks n Kim's playing the role of Rich & Poor perfectly. Great Cast! Loved the role of up and down shots n those stairs!!! Best Film of 2019 easily\n",
      "One of the best movies of all time!\n",
      "Screenplay and directing are amazing. Acting is superb\n",
      "I had a few expectations about this film but I was a little concerned because I dont like to lose time. Decided to give it a try and was surprised by the trama until middle of the film, when it changes completely from drama to futile violence. Really disappointed.\n",
      "A mediocre movie. Did not get at all what all fuss is about.\n",
      "This film is always going to be known as the first international (nonEnglish) film to win best picture. I am glad that the Oscars finally honored world cinema and I am especially glad this is a very good movie.I don't have much to add to what others have said. It is funny social satire, an engaging thriller and heart breaking drama (esp. the last shot of the film) rolled into a story that feels to go everywhere it needs to. I have watched this twice and it is such a engaging story first and foremost. That it also functions as a rebuke of capital makes the film richer but the social themes don't overwhelm it as pure storytelling.The film has a great vertical aspect to its visual constructions. It has a lot of stairs in the film and the camera is moving up and down a lot during it. It is not overdone but the use of space is really striking. So glad I blind bought this.\n",
      "This one has the lot\n",
      "Great movie\n",
      "Great cinematography\n",
      "Great script\n",
      "Great acting\n",
      "See it\n",
      "One of the best films I've ever seen.Technically perfect with a great story which moves effortlessly from humour to social commentary to tragedy.The best film of the year.\n",
      "A poor family cons a rich family into having them in their home.Let me start of that is an OK film for reasons mentioned in other reviews.\n",
      "However I just don't grasp why people find it a masterpiece. Also I don't like slapstick and 'pretending comedy' (comedy where the character is someone they're not and constantly worried being found out)It does not really highlight the self-destructive nature of the poor parasites:\n",
      "Bad habits, lazyness, naivety, drinking, smoking.Instead we just see some stupid decisions and it tries to make you feel 'sorry for them'?\n",
      "If they kept the jobs they got - with hard work - surely they wouldn't been living in that basement no more.The poor would be better suited with some hard talk rather than your fake pity. Work hard, don't smoke & drink and remove your bad habits.It ain't got integrity and it's virtue signaling for 10/10 reviewers, right?\n",
      "This is a dark comedy, no question about it. But is also an almost surreal movie. Very clever thought. This is the kind of movie that a lot of people want to do and fail badly. So if you are into dark comedy, strange movie, give it a go.\n",
      "I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not.\n",
      "Wow, I'll make it short and sweet. A must watch! Paradise is the best movie i've seen in a long time. Thank you for making this.\n",
      "Parasite brings the real meaning of putting together simple elements to compose something amazing. The film brings that development sequence, which serves to ask ourselves what the characters will do, what will happen to them, \"what will be the consequences they suffered, after these acts?\". In addition, I believe that the feature always wants to make it very clear that there is a suspense involved, that something will happen, that this work contains suspense, and terror. In the midst of that, for me, that scene of the boy calling his parents because he can't sleep, and Kim is on the floor, was kind of \"rude\". Of course, in order to convey a feeling of fear, and suspense, it is something that requires depth in the spectators. The film is a masterpiece. No wonder it won the Oscar for best picture of 2020. \"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan ever succeeds. No plan... Do you know why? If you make a plan, life never works out the way you expect.\n",
      "This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. I went into it not expecting to like it or even watch the whole thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The acting, writing, and directing were all perfect, but the end scene kind of overstayed its welcome.\n",
      "This movie rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture. Some think it was entirely political as this is the first ever foreign language film to win this award. I advise them to watch it because you cannot say it didn't deserve an Oscar if you didn't. It's just wonderful and shows how heavily underrated and overlooked Non-English films are.\n",
      "WOWIf you see this one movie this year, make sure it's Parasite.I will remember this movie for a long time. So funny yet so dark towards the end of this excellent film. Bong Joon Ho deserves every award he has one for this absolute gem. Please see this movie!\n",
      "This movie story is very much new concept story.. I can't believe one can write like this story.., everything in this movie is great.. Every upcoming scenes are perfect in it.. I think it has best story ever... Just go for it.. You will say.. \"Wah... What a story\" just watch it.. You will love it..\n",
      "I saw \"Parasite\", starring Kang_Ho Song-Snowpiercer, The Good The Bad The Weird; Woo_Sik Choi-Okja, Set Me Free; So_Dam Park-Fukuoka, The Priests and Hye_Jin Jang-Mothers, Marine Boy.\n",
      "In case you couldn't tell by the actors names above, this is a South Korean movie with sub_titles. It explores the question, exactly who is the parasite? Between the rich and the poor, either group could be considered a parasite on the other one. Kang_Ho is the father of an unemployed family in South Korea. When an opportunity pops up for his son, Woo_Sik, to be a private tutor to a rich family, Woo_Sik gets an idea for employing the rest of his family, including his father, Kang_Ho, his sister, So_Dam, and his mother, Hye_Jin. There are complications, of course, which come to a head as each member of his family takes the place of a former employee and before it's over, blood is spilled and people are dead.\n",
      "It's rated \"R\" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.\n",
      "It's not one that I would buy on DVD, but it would be a good rental.\n",
      "I am absolutely baffled as to the reason why this film has received such praise. Best movie of the decade? Best Picture of the year? Uhmmm no way no how. The movie was perfectly fine. I'd go so far as to say it was an average movie... perfectly fine. Certainly not a film I would watch ever again though. 1917 was amazing in my opinion and should've easily walked away with Best Picture.\n",
      "The scene where the family was under the table was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever watched in a movie. 10/10 amazing movie, those reviewing it anything lower then a 7 don't know what a good movie is.\n",
      "Terrific performances. Very much enjoyed this film. Beautiful camera work. The cast was nearly spot on. The direction was outstanding. Great work to all of them.\n",
      "You know what kind of plan never fails ? No plan . No plan at all , You know why ? Because life cannot be planned . . . With no plan , nothing goes wrong . And if something spins out of control , it doesn ' t matter , Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out , nobody cares . Get it ?\n",
      "This line of this movie stuck in my mind. It's like saying if the destiny choice you to be poor accept it don't ever bend your destiny to go with your demands or else you lose it all even the good things that been shadows out by life minority like freedom and love.\n",
      "This supposedly best film of 2019 South Korean venture into mystery, comedic thrills is for some hard to digest with not so likeable characters. There are grifters and then there are likeable grifters like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), The Grifters (1990), and Heartbreakers (2001). This movie in a fascinating way has similarities to a \"evil\" version of The Pink Panther (1963) or a more frightening chilly version of The Ice Storm (1997). Over time, the movie does seem to increase in its compelling mystery including a number of well-done tense scenes and twists. It's problematic though that such talented grifters would be living in such a disheveled, shoddy accommodations almost as if the director scripted it that way for dramatic effect and the father's outrageous behavior at the end seems a little overall the top without real sense of consistency with the storyline, except again to adhere to some dramatic script design to impress critics or audience members. Admittedly this movie succeeds in its intensity and captivating ambiance while building a sense of off-balanced comedy psychological drama. Yet the overall impact is an unsympathetic resonance that while attractive is also quite repulsive.\n",
      "Stop reading this review now and just go see Parasite! This movie worth every second of your life.\n",
      "This movie is about good direction, good acting but it's a movie riddled with plot holes.\n",
      "Parasite is everything you didn't expected it to be. Any advice? Don't take any spoilers and allow yourself to be surprised, and you will be every minute. Bong Jun Ho's film is humoured, ironic, fun, scary and effortlessly touching.\n",
      "The social side of the movie might seem very subtle, but it's everywhere. There aren't many metaphors to make it seem bigger, everything is neat and effective. This is the kind of movie you didn't expect to come from South Korea, but maybe it's this great because it is from South Korea.\n",
      "Actually this movie is not that brilliant! It has a good start, but then the plot is just disappointing. The end ruins the whole movie. The occuring violence is a very simple move to finish the messed up plot.And do not expect good acting or realistic characters. It is just overacting.\n",
      "Funny, scarcastic, touching, emotional... the movie builds up as a comedy but then shows the family drama and depicts a modern south korean society where the rich live in another galaxy, so far yet so close from a family of \"untouchables\". Inequalties of ou times are so well shown, in this comedy drama. best movie in 2019\n",
      "Starting 2004, I watched hundreds of K-movies, literally. Closer to 1,000 than 500, actually. Halfway into \"Parasite\", I was certainly entertained, but still wondering why this particular movie won this year's Oscar for best motion picture. Then I stopped wondering. Well deserved win!\n",
      "A few others would have been worthy contenders (\"Oldboy\", \" Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\", \"Bad guy\", \"A bittersweet life\" or \"3-Iron\" come to my mind and I forgot many others), but I guess Korean movies weren't on the radar until the mid-2010's. Better late than never...\n",
      "Asian films are not the most frequent guests on our screens, and, probably, the main reason for this is a significant difference in the perception of the world and mentality between East and West, which is eventually reflected in cinema as a special kind of art. Despite the abundance of awards, primarily in Western cinema (4 Oscars, and 1 in the main nomination), the viewer, accustomed to Western cinema clearly divided into genres, will not be easy to watch this film. In terms of belonging to the genre, I would call 'Parasite' a tragicomedy of situations built on the grotesque, and this combination can hardly be called common and easy to understand. The film is informative, which is quite important, in my opinion. It is felt that the director of the film, Bong Joon-ho, did his best. There is an academic sequence and a competent style of presentation of the plot. There is a plot, which occupies most of the tape, and then - the climax and denouement, which is devoted to about the second half of the picture. That is, there is something to see, and it is felt.Let's look at the plot of this movie in order.The Kim family is on the brink of survival. They live by part-time jobs, stealing Wi-Fi from their neighbors. In fact, parents have a profession, but for some reason they do not want to work in it or cannot - this is not disclosed. Children seem to be supposed to study, but the boy did not go to college, and about the girl it's completely strange.So, it all starts with the guy's friend offering him his job as a tutor for the duration of his internship. The first question is why forge documents if you have already been recommended? The final decision still takes place after an open lesson in the presence of my mother. Question two - why lie that this is not your sister, but some distant acquaintance? Perhaps some kind of Korean mentality is manifested in this. But if the owners are not against nepotism and recommendations, then I see no reason to invent something.The moment when the hostess leaked the driver in the end is not disclosed. This is a blatant failure in the script. But it is very well shown how a simple housewife can wind up a problem out of nothing, but then it is doubly strange why she does not use the services of trusted agencies. Especially, they are not cut off from society, but are friends with the same families and, for sure, exchange experiences. Plus, accepting a person into a family without a total check is like walking through a minefield. Silly and pointless. Especially when the husband is the head of an IT corporation, and it is easy for him. And it's easy to check the former driver for drugs, and you can simply reprimand him with a warning for having fun with a girl. In short, the film's credibility is seriously lame.Nevertheless, the nature of people is well revealed, who not only could not honestly get a job, but also began to feel like masters there. Fighting for their place, they were ready for a lot. After all, they did not want to return to their basement stinking life.I honestly feel sorry for the Pack family, who just wanted peace and quiet in the house. But with the staff they were totally unlucky. I would like to see the scene of their lives after the events that happened, how it all affected them. But we have only seen the last of the parasite family. The sad events nevertheless gave them an impetus to take up their minds and at least somehow take care of each other.Separately, I will speak about the Pakov house. This is an absolutely uncomfortable place, which is absolutely not suitable for a family with a child, but looks great on the screen. The housing of such wives is always decorated with something smoother, softer - after all, she bought a wigwam for a child, and carried it out onto the lawn. As if there is a separate world that does not fit into their house. The lawn was again decorated for the child's birthday. And the interiors remained with cold textures and clear lines.Yes, the script is interesting, dynamic and at the same time quite cruel, with unusual twists - this is a plus. A summary of this phenomenon and gaps that can be closed, just a little more screen time. Also a clear musical accompaniment, which is successfully accepted.Is this movie worth watching? Definitely yes, if you have a desire to look at the social problems of the modern world from an unexpected angle. What's more, the music, the beautiful interiors, the bright, heroic camera work, the lively atmosphere and the lust for profit make this film a serious challenge to yourself and ask yourself the question: 'Are you a parasite?'\n",
      "Parasite is a monumental picture that changed the perception of foreign films forever. It was less of a film, and more of an experience. Bong Joon-ho has created yet another masterpiece that will never leave your mind. Everyday you learn new things and immaculate details about the film that you never noticed, such as his use of lines throughout the film to represent the split in class and \"crossing the line\". His attention to detail is a huge factor in why this movie is so beautiful, but his knowledge of Korean culture and social class is what really makes this film outstanding. Knowing that the film is an accurate representation of the class structure in Korea is a huge eye-opener to those from other countries.The greatest part about this film though, is that it speaks to everyone in some way. To Koreans and even other parts of Asia, it's great Asian representation in the media and especially the film industry, considering how well it did. To film lovers, it's a combination of immaculate details and concepts put together in beautiful shots and scripts. To other viewers, it's a great tragic/comedy/thriller full of many twists and turns, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Parasite connects many different people and cultures through marvellous story telling. Their strive for what could possibly be seen as the \"American Dream\" certainly connects to a younger audience who have the same goals; Go to a great school, get a well-paying job, get rich and start a family. Teens who have been raised to strive for those same goals in life (including myself) can relate to their struggles to reach that goal, which is almost impossible. The acting in this film is impeccable. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik are such a powerful duo and bring light to their characters. Yet again, the performance by Kang-Ho Song is outstanding. His exemplary portrayal of a Korean father trying to take care of a struggling family while saving face is accurate and beautifully done.Parasite is exactly like it's name. It catches you off guard, infects your brain and never leaves it. This film is something that's never been done before. Breaking records, shaking up the film community and making a huge name for itself. Parasite has completely changed the game and set a huge bar not only for future korean films, but for future films in general. Bong Joon-ho is a master of his craft and I cannot wait for his next film.\n",
      "The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.\n",
      "What a weird movie! Parasite has some interesting things going on, it's a psychological thriller with elements of Stephen King's Misery, but then it also has self reflecting internal monologues that remind me of Trainspotting.\n",
      "Finishing this movie left me in AWE. Everything from the transition from a lighthearted introduction to a thriller drama, the directing, the intricate storyline (notice how connected everything is - really shows great scriptwriting), the reversal of roles and even the lumming existence of reality...I could go on for HOURS. To keep a long story short, this movie was SPECTACULAR. Do not shy away from this movie. The Academy has done something right.\n",
      "It is understood that Hollywood wanted to attract more costumers in Asia by handing this movie Oscars' Best Picture and Best Directing. I can't see how this movie surpasses \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" or \"Irishman\" in terms of the acting. This movie is average at best. The suspense is average (not better than \"Knives Out\"). The thrill is cheap. The cinematography is average. Too much implausibility. \"Marriage Story\" is even more entertaining that this movie.\n",
      "The story it self is kind of predictable but it is very eye opening and touching. The characters make you feel like they're real; for a second I forgot I was in a movie. I understand why it won best picture. The shooting of the film was AMAZING.\n",
      "It says it on the trailer,\" you expect this movie to be one thing', but it turns out to be something else\". This film shows an excessive amount of multilayered symbolism and all the ideologies portrayed in the film mainly revolved around the central idea of class distinction. At first glance, the theme may seem quite simple,, but then you start to understand the true nature of the film. The film is filled with finesse in terms of direction. Every little thing has a meaning behind it and all the credit goes to the director ( Bon joon ho) for depicting things so beautifully. The title,\"parasite\", suggest how a parasite ( in the film- underclassmen) devours the host. But the movie shows how even in something so nether there are feelings and emotions present. The part where the blood falls onto the pale bread is a masterpiece in my opinion as it perfectly summarizes the movie and it has such depth of meaning behind it. I was trying not to give away too much and that is the reason the review seems quite awkward but honestly, i do not words to describe Bon Joon ho's depth of thought and make sure you add this film in your watch list right now.\n",
      "If any creation is able to make an unforgettable imprint of what needs changing in this world, that production has fully achieved it's purpose. Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities. There's alot to gather from this movie and what's truly interesting when it's viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are.\n",
      "Parasite is a good, dark, comedy.But it's not worthy of Oscar Best Picture.\n",
      "Pretty simply, I was expecting a slow burn thriller with an jaw dropping ending...I mean, this did beat out 1917 for best picture and that movie blew me away!So i watched with anticipation, waiting for that screw to turn...waiting and waiting until the final act when the resolution hit and I was like...uh, that's it?? I wont say what it is, but it was very underwhelming.This is not a horrible movie, but its in no way a 10 or worthy of an oscar.\n",
      "Without giving away any major plot points Parasite can only be described as one of the most unmistakable yet subtle pieces of social commentary of the 21st century. Focused around the idea of class divide it explores the unavailability of social mobility as broken system and highlights the nonchalant attitude of the upper classes towards less fortunate people.\n",
      "Shot beautifully and includes an incredible performance by Kang So Hong. All round a brilliant film.\n",
      "I think that this movie isn't best movie in bong junho director.\n",
      "But you can watch this movie for understanding his movies.\n",
      "POSITIVES:1) The film perfectly blends genres of drama, comedy, thriller and even horror at times\n",
      "2) The entire night time sequence, where the rich family come home early from holiday and our main characters have to hide and escape, is cinematic perfection. It's so incredibly tense and it's almost like watching a stage play at times\n",
      "3) The film gets you fully invested in the characters and the plot and had me on the edge of my seat for a lot of it\n",
      "4) Fully deserved that this is the film to make history by being the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the OscarsNEGATIVES:1) I find the first half of the film to be a bit of a slog. Everything prior to the old housekeeping showing up in the middle of the night feels too slow paced for me. I also find it quite unbelievable how easy it was for our lead characters to wiggle their way into the lives of the rich family\n",
      "2) Right as the film is working amazingly and at an incredibly high point for tension, it completely undercuts itself by going off on a weird side plot where the family's home is flooded and they have to go and live in a gymnasium. I get the idea of this was probably supposed to be to illustrate how poor they are in comparison to the rich family they have infiltrated, but it just felt like an unnecessary lengthening of the runtime to me\n",
      "3) The ending is an issue for me. I found the violent killing spree to be too sudden and not to gel very well with what had came prior.\n",
      "Just watch it. It has everything; entertainment, comedy, thrill, horror (yes!), suspense, drama, tragedy everything!!\n",
      "Movie has several messages, several anecdotes, things shown metaphorically.\n",
      "Since it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Mom and I were curious about watching this Korean film and we finally did today after I checked this out from the library. The verdict: It's interesting how the picture goes to various places concerning the poor family being employed by the rich one and then also a surprise concerning an eventual former employee of the rich family with a secret... Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it. But it's a unique enough piece of work so that's something of a recommendation...\n",
      "We like this movie. Really interesting story. The actors play is very good.\n",
      "Won best picture, I understood why after watching it. Definitely a must watch.\n",
      "If this deserves Oscar,\" get out\" deserves it too. It's a good movie, but lack of logic\n",
      "The only good thing about this movie is...Nothing.\n",
      "Pure diamond in cinema. Brilliantly made, showing a figurative depiction if the great class divide not only in Korea but around fhe world\n",
      "The truth is that the movie is about not 2 but 3 different class of society.\n",
      "The Parks: the true upper class..Represented by wealth....huge house.... Abundance of sunlight... concerned with only First world problems...The Kims: the lower middle class... represented by unemployment.... Half basement house....lack of sunlight... Concerned only with their struggle for better lifestyle...The Ohs: the true lower class... Represented by hunger.... Deep basement..... Absolutely no sunlight... Concerned only with their survival....For the first half of the movie, we see only two classes, Parks and Kims and it shows how Kims are leaching on to Parks for their well being like a Parasite...But later when the third class is introduced as Ohs, audience begin to believe that actually Ohs are true Parasite as they offer nothing in return to Parks for what they steal..As we approach the final quarter, when the **** hits the fan....the perspective is switched again to show that Parks, the luxury class, are the true Parasite, they depend on the society for their lifestyle and pleasures but don't even give respect to the once they depend on. This is the true revelation.The movie brilliantly shows how cruel is each class towards other. Pay attention to how the Kims react when they find out their is another class below them. They also show no sympathy to Ohs and they hurt them and leave them to die of hunger. (As depicted in No plan is the plan scene).Another thing to pay attention is the scholar's rock, it is truly metaphorical as it is a symbol of hope, as shown in the scene it was introduced. Ki-Woo shown to be always hopeful as he is shown clinging on to the rock even when their whole house is flooded and they are turned homeless overnight and in the end it this rock (hope) that hurts him the most and yet he is hopeful that one day he will buy the house to free up his dad.This capitalistic world is at balance when each class is happy with where they are but it starts trembling down when the lower classes try to move up the social ladder.\n",
      "The scene where the Kims get taste of upper class luxury is where it starts to get ugly and when the true lower class try to rise the whole society shambles. Ultimately everyone loses something. Lowest classes losing everything (the couple dies), Middle loses half of what they have ( the daughter dies and father is imprisoned) and the upper class only loses a quarter of their family.This movie has so many layers and so much depth, it is best understood if you watch it three times from three different perspective of each class.\n",
      "Parasite was one of the best films of 2019. It engaged the audience by building tension slowly throughout the first half, then having everything come crashing down throughout the second half, as if in slow-motion. One of my favourite aspects of this was that, as Mr. Kim says in the latter half of the film, there was no plan to their actions. This way, the audience doesn't know what's happening until it's over, and that might suggest that the Kims don't either. Still, the rush that I felt when I figured out pieces of their plan is difficult to find in most films. Two examples of this are when Mr. Kim poured the hot sauce onto the tissue, to trick Mrs. Park into firing her housekeeper under suspicion of tuberculosis, or later in the film when they hide under the table from the Park family. I'm pretty sure I audibly gasped when Mr. Kim lifted up the tissue with 'blood' on it.\n",
      "An important thing to note is that the film, though made in Korea, represents the futility of the American Dream in a way that I've never seen before. When I say 'American Dream', I mean the ideal that if you work hard enough, you can become rich and successful. Both the Kims and the Parks, I would say, are living in fantasy worlds of this ideal. The Parks believe that they've worked hard to get where they are, and therefore deserve household employees who don't smell like a basement. The Kims, on the other hand, hold the belief that working hard will someday get them where the Parks are, figuratively and literally. No one believes this more strongly than Ki-woo, the son of the Kim family. This is shown throughout the film, from even before he first gets the job as an English tutor, when he's trying to get a job with the pizza delivery driver. Once he gets the job, he believes it's his way out and he can save enough money for college. The worst part about this is that he still holds this belief at the very end of the movie, when he writes a letter (that he has absolutely no way to send) to his dad. The letter describes this exact ideal; if Ki-woo works hard and goes to university and makes money, he can buy the house his father is hiding in, and literally be where the Parks were at the start. Since he's already been rejected from college multiple times, and South Korean real estate is crazy expensive, it would be impossible for him to achieve this goal, but he still believes he can. This is, in my opinion, the saddest part of the movie. Since this is how it ends, it leaves the viewer contemplating whether he could actually achieve his dream of saving his father, which makes the film much more powerful.\n",
      "I'm prejudiced against Korean movies. It sounds like simple imitations of Hollywood movies. But this movie is really different. Congratulations they made a very good movie. He definitely deserved Oscar.\n",
      "A poor street savvy family trick their way into taking on various roles working for a very rich family. The con works well until an unexpected turn of events leaves them in danger of being found out.Extraordinarily absorbing film which manages to combine societal messages with high drama and laugh out loud comedy. All the characters in both families are a pleasure to be with - there are no villains here - and you just sit back and enjoy a well scripted journey in the certain knowledge that it's going to end in tears. The sets and the set pieces (the storm, the piece under the table etc) are superbly structured and the main house begins to feel like a genuine home. A lingering, audacious masterpiece\n",
      "This movie got the stellar reviews just because the PC crowd got pi**ed off that Joker took all the limelight. There had to be a \"counter-balace\" and this movie got hyped.\n",
      "The first half is overly melodramatic and \"funny\" as in American Pie type funny, and the latter half at the very best portrays some of the struggles of Korean society-presented in a weird and almost Twilight Zone-ish way. But that's litetally it! Besides the sudden plot/atmospheric twist there is little else. Imagine if K-pop was a movie, and the last part of the tune turns to a Metallica song. That's this movie in a nutshell. It was not bad, but all the stellar reviews are give it way too much credit. Joker won, the rest is just attempts to br de jour.\n",
      "Watched in plane. First 2/3 of the film was superb.\n",
      "Last act was little silly. Going to see in theater also.\n",
      "This started off as a comedy but then turns into a borderline horror movie, the ending will definitely stick with you, but expect anything\n",
      "Parasite is a masterpiece. From it's funny, engaging opening, to it's shocking, sudden end has beautiful cinematography and great hidden meanings throughout the movie. I need say no more.\n",
      "9.9/10\n",
      "One of the best films I've ever seen. Amazing. If you've not seen it yet, stop reading this and go watch it.\n",
      "Brilliant way to depict the late capitalism era we are living.\n",
      "Although Bong Joon-Ho's American movies have been subpar, his Korean movies still continue to be must see, especially on the big screen. His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at. Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background, which most certainly was not put there by accident. If you have seen Joon-Ho's other film, you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts.\n",
      "Honestly, this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it. I can't stop thinking about all the excitement, agony, disturbance, turmoil, and sorrow that was brought upon me. Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters. It certainly deserves the Palme d'Or (I haven't seen The Lighthouse yet) and all the praise that comes with it. I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I'm most certain it won't because it's an international film (bunch of cowards).\n",
      "This film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs. the poor (a common theme for Korean movies). At the beginning, the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people. Later on, after making money beyond their wildest dream, they slowly started to change. For example, before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house, they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be. After the money had been rolling in, they decided that they had enough \"status\" to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out. Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image.\n",
      "My favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette. For some reason that scene just resonates with me. She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded. Her home, the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone. So she sits there on top of a toilet that's now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste. She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard.\n",
      "The dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film. He had for the longest time, wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him.\n",
      "From what I just said above, I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house. Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status. The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes. The son, after he gets out of the hospital, went back to the house to check on, I presume, the girl. They are all drawn to the place.\n",
      "As a cinephile, I was pleased to go into this blind. The less you know, the better and the more suspense you will feel. There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act. The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone.\n",
      "The only drawback I have for the US release is, the film was very limited in my area. It wasn't too bad for me but from what I read, other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away. I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films, but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it.\n",
      "It is pulling you into reality and at the same time to the illusion.\n",
      "Showing both side and connecting them well.\n",
      "Spectacular ending.\n",
      "Congrats!\n",
      "Very over rated. I watched this movie because of its good reviews. Wasn't as good as it was rated.\n",
      "Finally got a chance to watch the best picture, director, screenplay winner: PARASITE and it's brilliant. Simple in it's beginning for a family wanting to find a living then a brilliant comedic lie to earn it and the complex aftermath it creates only to end in a mirage. South Korea nailed the want of every person that does not have and the blind ignorance of some who do...Highly recommended even with subtitles.\n",
      "This movie holds the pure depth of cinematic drama in 02 hours\n",
      "This movie was a treat. I had heard from friends that it was a pleasant surprise. Went into it expecting a thriller, got so much more. It was funny, heart-warming, scary. It did fill all the boxes. Worthy of the BEST PIC award. No agendas. No silliness. Just good writing and a well-spun plot. We loved it!\n",
      "Original, entertaining and very well drafted film. It nicely mixes comedy genre with drama and delivers a quirky protrayal of class differences.\n",
      "The concept works and could be placed in many societies. The characters were extremely well written and developed. Generally you care for them from the beginning and they keep being investing through the whole film. Bong Joon Ho newest film really captures you and is quite though provoking in general. The acting is very solid with the best performances coming from Kang-ho Song and Woo-sik Choi. The rest of the cast does marvelously as well.\n",
      "The setting is nice, offering the audience very nice and believable sets and beautiful pictures. Bong Joon Ho's direction is constantly good as he perfectly understands his characters, their motivations and generally gives the film a very nice flow you can easily follow and he makes sure you never lose interest in it.\n",
      "I wish Hollywood would also come up with original stuff like that and such great screenplays.\n",
      "I LOVED Snowpiercer, I LIKED The Host!But this one... oh my my! The Parasite is such a disappointment after the above mentioned movies. Dull dragging preachy drama. You'd fare better and find more excitement attending a Catholic Mass or reading Encylopedia !!!\n",
      "I will admit that Hung is a master cinematographer, and can tell a good story for the most part, but like the movie Mother, which I believe came out in 2012, that he also wrote and directed, it just Falls flat at the end and doesn't really end, but more or less just stops mid sentence.For the most part, this movie had me on the edge of my seat, and the middle of the film had me biting my freaking Nails because it was so exciting and embarrassing to watch. Parasite really delivers and is a very intriguing film that is beautiful shot and really is one heck of a ride, but that ride comes to a sudden stop at the end, which is both jarring and jaw gaping considering that this movie was such a thrill, only to become a shoe being thrown at your head.I wish that the ending was better, but I will take it oh, because I don't think that every single story needs to end on a high note, but I do believe that the story at least needs to have resolution in order for it to be a success.\n",
      "I started to rent on Demand several times because of the high meta score rating of 96 but the fact it was sub-titled made me change my mind several times. Finally my 19 yr old son who rarely watches movies, especially sub-titled came to me and wanted to rent it... so we did and wow what an interesting evening. We were fascinated from the first few minutes and never was there a dull moment. Great acting, great story and a very very well directed movie!A great night of entertainment!!!!\n",
      "It's a good movie, but surely not better than Joker!!\n",
      "Hollywood BS will always be Hollywood BS. The Oscars are not what they used to be; just a night to make political statements. Ricky Gervais said it best!\n",
      "I loved it. LOVED LOVED loved it.\n",
      "Wow just wow. Everything in this movie is just so damn captivating. Parasite was directed Bong Joon Ho and man....you sir...take a god damn bow. This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you laugh, cry, get scared, have chills, etc. name any genre and it is all in one. That's why I love it so much it all the genres of any movie and it is in this film just as one. The cast were phenomenal and fantastic. I didn't get to see this in theaters.... and boy does that suck. I loved it so much 2019 had the best movies I have ever seen such as Joker and 1917. This along with my top 10 list is the best movies of all time. 10/10 Brilliant absolutely brilliant\n",
      "Standing out as the first non-English film to win an Oscar for Best Picture, this movie is both revolutionary as well as a thourougly fantastic picture.Combining black humour with a cleverly written narrative of a family tricking its way into riches, it manages to be both incredibly funny as well as shocking, tragic and subtle in the way it delivers its message.The actors are all fantastic and everything from cinematography to the cutting and scenery is outstanding.I am very proud to have seen this on its 2019 premiere, and will watch it many times in the future. The Oscars have evolved marvelously thanks to this beautiful movie!\n",
      "Terrific film. My girlfriend and I watched this with no idea of what the plot or sentiment was. The subtitles were an adjustment initially but the film was very much worth the time that it took us to adjust. I highly recommend Parasite for anyone who loves an attention grabbing film.\n",
      "Fully deserves the best picture Oscar this is the best film of the last few years and easily in my top 10 of all time, it's truly a work of art.\n",
      "This was a clever and amusing dark comedy until it went way too dark and kooky about two thirds of the way into the film. The first two thirds of the movie very enjoyable if somewhat of a cliché view of the social classes in South Korea. It was much more disparaging of a low class family though. It portrayed them lazy, slovenly, dishonest amateur con artists waiting for their next victim. It was funny if you don't take it seriously. I wonder if the director actually wanted you to believe he is saying that this is a depiction of a typical lower class family in South Korea. His portrayal of the upper class family was also cliché if a bit more muted and of course overly simplistic.The horror slasher ending segment seemed like a completely separate movie. I think it was totally unnecessary and thrown in for shock value only. I understand that the characters and the plot around the dungeon husband and his enabling wife was also added on to the story s a weird twist. The twist of their predicament was amusing if not pretty far over the top. I suppose was a hint of the really crazy stuff yet to come. It really went downhill for me when they tied up the couple, throwing the former housekeeper down the stairs. It looked like she was dead. And then it really started to go off the rails when the Parasite son went into the dungeon with the rock to do what? Kill the couple in the dungeon??? Come on! From there on it was bloody ridiculous.It just seems to me that the director was just not satisfied with making a fun dark comedy and had to add a silly teen slasher segment for shock value. Best picture??? It certainly was not a great year for quality movies but there were other films that were overall better than this.\n",
      "Not sure why this movie score so high in rating. Been seeing korea drama many years, just a drama plus a movie call (US) version. No one in my cinema was laughing its lame joke,I prefer the US way of telling the lower class try to overtake upper-class story.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.\n",
      "Again, I had little to go on coming into my viewing of Parasite, which I think is always best. The story and its telling are clever, interesting and at times thought provoking. The cast is uniformly fine, not great, but fine. I won't repeat the storyline here as its been told enough but I will speak to elements of it. The poor and clever class and the wealthy and not so bright class are both painted a little broadly and predictably for me. The very bloody, 'Tarantino' like ending was also a bit over the top as well. Still, Bong Joon Ho does a fine job in creating what I think is a fresh and unique film experience definitely worth checking out.\n",
      "I was lucky enough to stumble upon this film in a small theater while traveling abroad. It is the best film surprise I have seen made in my lifetime. This is a modern day Citizen Kane full of brilliance behind every scene and the small details are beautiful to watch. This film is an essence of humanity and must see for cinema lovers. Absolutely well deserved for its best picture Oscar.\n",
      "I would give this 11 stars if I could since this is the first movie I have ever seen where I couldn't predict the twists or ending.\n",
      "Best movie I've seen since Parasite. I've never seen a film that took as many risks. And I've never seen a film where almost every single one of them paid off. Wow.\n",
      "A film living up to the word \"amazing\", from all aspects, bringing up issues like class-divide and showing a plethora of emotions and thoughts throughout the film, like irony, rage, selfish desires.\n",
      "The whole film revolves around the word \"Parasite\". The film clearly shows how one class leeches off the resources of the other. The poor and financially needy, taking advantage of the wealth of the rich, while the rich leech off the labor of the poor.\n",
      "A great experience, which gets over the cultural boundaries in a heartbeat. You feel immersed in the narrative, as the story unfolds.\n",
      "A must watch for all movie fans.\n",
      "Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, breathing the air in the dark room can only walk like a ghost. You can't let go of a poor stone for a lifetime, and you will never get rid of the cheap smell. Curly bed bugs, sterilize yourself with windows of potions; hosts in high places, use money to hire people to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked the blood of the poor soared, the poor sent their lives to the rich, the people and ghosts shared food in the same room, and the insects and beasts developed together to develop enemies. In \"The Parasite\", we saw President Park's family who were blinded by money. In a high society, they respect wealth and status, but ignore the lower class people who live in darkness. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased the antagonism between the two major class relations, and has become the trigger for the tragedy.\n",
      "I'm sure I'll get hated to the hill for this, but this wasn't a masterpiece. It was well acted, from what I could tell. Without knowing Korean, it's certainly possible I'm missing nuances of language that I correct in my own mind through the subtitles. I've seen others defending the second half of the movie, but that really is where it goes off the rails. We were enjoying it up until the party started. Then nothing makes much sense. It completely separates the plot into 2 distinct movies, the 2nd of which isn't that good. The movie explains most of its \"nuance\" and \"message\" with plot devices that work out \"just right\" to explain themselves. But they're just plot devices. And the end plays out as if we're supposed to be happy at the reunion? He killed someone that did nothing to him, except tell his own wife \"he smells.\"Snowpiercer and Train to Busan were better movies, tho they suffered from the same \"poor ending\" problem. But those endings were 5-10 minutes long, not 30. All in all, I really wanted to love this like everyone else does, but neither myself nor my wife did, come the end. I understand subtlety, but it really seems like people are digging so deep for it, that they're applying things that even the director never intended. Maybe that's the \"abstract\" nature of it, I'm not Roger Ebert.\n",
      "I was able to see \"Parasite\" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn't that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person's head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it's still a good film but one I really wish I hadn't seen.\n",
      "I don't usually watch movies that make me think, it defeats the purpose of mindless entertainment. But this had such great reviews that I had to give it a go, and I was hooked.Don't be alarmed by the adults guide claiming that it is severely gory, it is not. There is some violence but nothing that should deter anyone from watching this.No spoilers here, just do yourself a favour and watch this.\n",
      "I know I am pretty late to the review party but its never too late to acknowledge great artistic work and give credit where credit is due. Hmm where can I begin?, let's start with the interesting title \" Parasite\". At a first glance of the movie description, one may quickly presume that the struggling Kim family are the parasites leaching off their host, the Park family by using deception and tricks to get them to sack their workers in order to replace them and have their entire income come from the Park family. This is partly true. However, this story can also be viewed from the angle of exploitation and how descriminatory, delusional and naïve a lot of rich people can be. It also explores the inherent greed in most people who are willing to do anything to climb the to the top of the wealth ladder.First of all, let us look at the Kim family in perspective. From the first scene, we realize that this is a family that struggles everyday and can barely afford the necessities of modern day living such as internet connectivity. They can barely afford fumigation or insectides and they have to rely on smoke from community fumigation to get rid of insects in their room. A friend of Ki- Woo offers him an opportunity to apply for a home tuition job in the wealthy Kim's household. Seeing an opportunity to make some money, Ki woo forges a college certificate with the help of his sister, \"Jessica\" in order to be employed to be Da-Hye's teacher. This is where the first deception begins. Upon seeing how naïve and gullible Mrs. Park is in the sense that she immediately employed him without thoroughly examining him or his documents, he sees an opportunity to further exploit the Kim's family and probably in his mind, an opportunity to change his own family's fortunes.Gradually, other members of the Kim family also infiltrate the Park's household with deception realizing how \"trusting\" and naïve they are. The story had a sharp and interesting plot twist when the Kim's realized they were not the only ones leaching off the Park family. Due to their inherent greed, they decided to be hostile to another set of \"parasites\" knowing that they themselves are parasites leaching off their host. Sometimes, even parasites who know very well they are parasites will even fight and srumble for the crumbles of their host. However, the disparity between the rich and the poor especially in modern times is so gigantic that it will take a transformational step in order to climb to the ladder of wealth. This opposes the notion that struggling and working hard in life will automatically make you rich. The hard truth is that, most often than not, it is simply not enough and people do not only have to work hard or smart but need to find themselves in the right place with the right people in order to become wealthy. For instance, a person born into a rich family is more likely to become wealthy with a quarter of the hard work a poor person puts in. That is just a fact. However, societies cultural hegemony has fueled the belief that poor people are simply not working hard or smart enough and one can become wealthy simply by working hard or smart and obeying society's rules and regulations. It blatantly ignores the role of location, gender, family, race, ethnicity among others which play a more significant role in determining the future of a person.This cultural hegemony has fueled the belief of rich people such as Mr. Kim to further see themselves as above poor people in terms of class and respect and as such, those people who work for them should know their limits and never \"cross the line\" which is why he fired his driver even without getting to know the truth behind the alleged affair in the car. He refused to \"bring himself to the level\" of confronting his driver over an issue because he simply saw himself as superior to his workers, he would rather his wife make up an excuse than to fire him to confront the situation head on.Again, the Park's family in a way can also be seem as parasites because they tend to give their workers extra work they did not bargain for without considering their schedule or the emotional impact these chores will have on them. For instance, whilst the Mr. Kim and his family where still spending the night in a basketball court because their home was submerged in water, the park's family seemingly without consideration for their poor workers ask them to come and help in setting up a place for an impromptu party without even trying to find out how they spend the night after the heavy rain. They tend to believe that the money or the wages they pay them will make up for any inconvenience and humiliation they are putting them through. As time went on, the Kim family begun to feel emotionally drained from the chores they are been made to perform and the lack of consideration being given to their emotional well being by the the Park family. They also slowly come to terms with the fact that no matter how much deception or what they call \" plan\", they will never be in the wealthy class. They begin to regret the plan they have hatched for themselves and that plan instead of being a tool to escape poverty became a prison and a tool for inferiority complex. This can be demonstrated in the scene where Min asks Da Hye whether he fits in the party and the family and even though she nodded affirmatively, he did not believe he fits in and can actually ever fit in this wealthy class.Out of all the members of the Kim family, the only person who had any resemblance to fitting in was Ki Jung ( Jessica) as Min alluded to when they were sitting in the absent Park's living room celebrating their seemingly successful \"plan\".This movie has a lot of genres in one. It starts as comedy, slowly becomes a dark comedy , drama then becomes a horror in the climax. It is a mixed bag of emotions. There is no true hero or villain. You can blame the Kim family for being greedy and you can be also blame the Park family for being delusional and descriminatory and most importantly, exploitative. In the end, they are all parasites exploiting one another in various ways.In the end, Mr. Kim hides in the house that provided for him and becomes a prisoner of his own thoughts and actions (plan) after commiting a gruesome murder of Mr. Park. Life they say comes at you fast and this is especially true when you take a deceptive step.His son's dreams of having enough money to buy the house one day and re unite with his self imprisoned father but in reality this is practically impossible as according to the director, it is going to take Min over 100 years realistically to buy that house.Some of the interesting symbolism I also observed in the story was the symbolism of the rock which was given to Min as a gift from his friend. Outwardly, it may look like a rock until you realise that it was floating in the water during the flood which defies the law of density. Min also saw the fake rock as a sort of representation of his hopes and dreams because he tend to carry it with him even after the flood. Those dreams probably included that he believed one day he was going to marry Da- Hye and live in the house and become a member of the wealthy Kim family and since that dream was built on deception and tricks, it became as fake as the rock and in the end the fake rock which represented his dreams became an object that lead to his demise. This was an intelligent subliminal symbolism from the director.Another symbol of the disparity between the Kim's poverty and the park's wealth was whilst \"Jessica\" was relaxing in a bath tub and watching television in the house that belonged to the Parks pretending it belonged to her, reality dawned on her when she sat on the toilet that was over flowing with faeces smoking a cigarettes in their room during the flood .That act shows how she realizes and accepted her situation. It also represents despair and a failed planThis is undoubtedly Boo Jon Hoo's magnum Opus and it is on my list of the top 10 best movies of all time . It came as no surprise to me that it became the only non English movie in history to win an academy for best picture.\n",
      "This film is great. It is good at what it tried to be. The performances are good but a bit overreacted in my opinion, that's the only drawback this film has. The shots/ camera work is phenomenal. The directing is great and the storyline is perfect. This is a film where the second time you watch it the better it gets. There are so many themes in this film and objects that are placed on purpose to convey a message. This film is manly about crossing boundaries and the status difference from these two families. Smell also plays a big role in this film. Smell is a way that the rich family differs from the poor family. The rich family see them as parasites.Great film not overhyped and a entertaining watch.\n",
      "Story was very unpredictable and giving good messages.\n",
      "That line impressed me: \"she is kind because she is rich\"\n",
      "Parasite presents us with two completely different realities and their parallels. While the successful live a peaceful life, those with less money are living in precarious conditions. The rich cannot tarnish their image as good people and the poor need to pretend to be from a higher class to fit in among them. Parasite is an obvious criticism, but with subtexts that can generate several debates. The film shines by playing with different genres throughout the plot and carrying them out in an excellent way. Comedy, horror, drama, action and suspense are mixed in an extremely effective way, projecting a mix of emotions to the viewer, but never in a confusing way. Parasite is one of the greatest works of the 21st century. An excellent review, an excellent film and a modern classic.\n",
      "This shook me so good my ponytail elastic snapped, it's a good thing I wore pigtails.\n",
      "The story is as good as the cinematography...but 2nd half could be much better as well as the ending.Overall it seems to be overrated considering everything.\n",
      "The vague incisions that are carved in your mind as you navigate through the elusive metaphors within the movie become clearer as the plot develops and unwillingly grips you with a truly unique plot, charismatic characters, sagacious dialogue, and unexpected events that last from beginning to end. The complexity of the plot resists in helping you answer questions like: Who has the higher moral standpoint? Who deserves to get the upper hand? Is the Kim family truly malevolent? If you were in their position would you do the same? Do you feel compassion and sympathy for Ki-Taek even after killing Mr. Park?The movie accomplishes a feat that most movies nowadays are not able to: every single character is complex enough to merit forgiveness, understanding, and redemption. One character, despite all the deficits and obstacles, is attempting to survive to be able to get an education, wealth, and prestige, be secure financially and equally valuable as the Park family is; he is trying not to be a parasite. Another character is freer and careless, even self-destructive, acceptant of that fate that life has bestowed her. A bit more lost, but ultimately only guilty of attempting to have enough money to help the family. In the entire movie you cannot find a single instance of sadism or even malevolence from any of the \"parasites\". They are fervently trying to survive and equipped with sufficient cunning to achieve their goals and can you blame them?After an hour of receiving the earnest nature of the message of parasite, I recognized that the movie is not particularly expressing a message about meritocracy. If there is a central element of this movie it is social mobility or the lack thereof. The Kim family was attempting to survive, yes; they deserved better circumstances, maybe, but their main juncture was the fact that they are attempting to progress and elevate themselves in the social hierarchy: social mobility. Anyone with a modicum of empathy can empathize with the ruthless suffering of the lower class or underrepresented = the Kim family. The director tries to demonstrate in creative forms the insensitivity of the wealthy class to the precarious nature of the poor. The movie is basically a metaphor of class struggle with comedic, dramatic, and violent gestures.How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances? This is, in straightforward terms, the dilemma of the movie. I am going to be your parasite, because you do not respect me nor help me, quite the contrary: you think I'm lesser than you, dirtier than you, and smellier than you. As a parasite I will inhabit your body and nourish myself taking advantage of you, while possibly murdering you. It's a harsh message, but a real one. Many people are living in untenable conditions, while the wealthy class excuse themselves with meritocracy while they enjoy their opulence.In the movie as the Kim family understands the crude reality of social mobility they eventually become desperate, violent, and homicidal. The inhumane elitism of the Park family becomes more apparent even after traumatic situations happen. This is one of the morals of the narrative. Elitism will usually triumph against the working class and the myth of social mobility proliferated in class struggle might have to be debunked with bloodshed and imagination. There is a line in the movie that expresses the other moral really well: \"If I had all this money and freedom, I would probably be a good person. Heck, I would probably be a much better person than Ms. Park\". Finally, Ki-Taek reflection after escaping the flooded house is the last moral of the movie: \"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\" In this case, Ki-Taek reflects on his situation and tries to justify his failure by habituating his son to a life of no strategy, plan or ambition. He wants his son to love him, but in his desperation he is also habituating him to failure: make them believe that chaos and degeneracy is their only option, and they will attempt to live happily within their exploitation.\n",
      "Maybe this film makes a statement about class, as some claim. It could just as well be a statement about films, or the film industry. Nicely produced and well-acted, the plot was almost entirely predictable but the climax seemed contrived--though the denouement was interesting. Somehow American Beauty came to mind. That's about all I've got, having just seen it.\n",
      "First, the movie is simply too long. Second, so many unbelievable scenes, such as:When the rich family goes camping (completely unbelievable) the poor family parties in the rich family's living room spilling food and grain alcohol everywhere. When the rich family comes home unexpectedly, they hurriedly sweep the food and spilled alcohol under the coffee table. How can the rich parents sleep on the couch two feet away from this mess but don't see or smell any of this - especially the husband with the fabulous sense of smell? Or at the very least smell the stinky family who are also hiding under the coffee table?Poor family's home is flooded by sewage and rain water due to a deluge. The family goes home to try to rescue what they can, wading thru chest high sewage water in their house, but nothing is salvageable except the rock. That night they sleep in a shelter but wake up the next day dry with not a trace of filth on any of them. Oh, and their phones are still charged and work. I guess they were on their heads. And then they go directly to work at the rich guys house for the son's birthday party. The daughter in a lovely dress. The son in nice clothes. The dad in his chauffeur uniform. Huh?Scenes like that make me crazy...But I did like the fact that the first housekeeper was as corrupt as the poor family. That I didn't see coming. Or the Quentin Tarantino ending.\n",
      "Literally so many unexpected twists and non-clichéLiterally I can watch this movie every single day without getting bored\n",
      "I just saw the film and I went in unsure if it'd be as good as the hype. The film was enjoyable; everything was solid from story, character development, cinematography, editing. The film had a good flow and plenty of surprises. There certainly was deeper meanings to the film and great exposure to the Korean culture. The problem with this film isn't the film at all but those reviewing it. For those that swoon about the film or those that call it awful are way off base. The film is neither; and it certainly isn't a Tarantino violent style film. It is a good film I'd probably see a couple more times to find all the different angles of this complex story. It won best picture for good reason but it certainly didn't bury the competition; any of those could have won depending on what the viewer was looking for. It's a good film and should be seen and likely more than once.\n",
      "It's been years since I've seen a movie that kept me completely engulf through every single minute. Parasite is an amazing film that entwines emotions and thrills.You build a soft spot for both families, and begin to change your perception of who the villains really are.It's quite laughable how symbolic the twist of it all is, but that very twist will have you hoping and wishing for a happy ending to those very same con artists who caused the tragedy.You will build a bond to every character and this 2 hour movie will feel like 30 minutes.I wish I could feel the sensation of watching this movie as though I'd never seen it before.What a breath of fresh air!\n",
      "Good to watch the Chinese movie about crime and profession set in a dark world all characters are watchable and good acting has been done.\n",
      "There is a lot of comedy and drama in the film but I consider it a thriller and a good one. I learned a lot of stuff about the culture and pretty much we are not different. It's always the same situation with slightly different dimensions. This is a cruel world.\n",
      "I had no idea this movie existed until the 2020 Oscars, the sypnosis made Paraiste look boring but let me tell you - it's amazing! If you like slowburns and feeling disturbed, this is the movie for you.I would recomend going in blind as you'll get a better experience but reading the description won't spoil anything. Also - don't watch it in dub, I promise the sub is way more efficent and WILL make the movie better.The only reason for rating it 8/10 is because it isn't my favourite movie, there's some flaws and rabbit-holes but the diector did confirm that Parasite will be turned into a series.\n",
      "Calling this movie dreck does a disservice to dreck. Message is simple: Wealthy people crazy and evil. Poor people understandably crazy and evil. Only redeeming quality is dramatic twist at halfway point but even this soon resolves into poor people crazy and understandably evil. Watched this because I had heard it had comedic elements and it had one if you think a pratfall is funny. Hopefully the only reason this got Oscar talk is to prove non-xenophobic cred of the Academy. Please stay away from this grossly overrated dose of depression.\n",
      "But its a must watch movie , amazing. In the middle it gets predictable and then get better and more suspense u stay at the edge of ur seat.\n",
      "Simplicity is the best way to express opinion, Parasite is the best example of it ! The best part of the movie, when there have no way to live like a easy life then man take clever way despite of it is bad.\n",
      "It show what the actual world is. Depending on culture and society the life is different but concept is same in whole world. IN real world we see these reflection everywhere. Nice movie.\n",
      "An extraordinary film and a rarity to see a film which is so startlingly original. I can't wait to see more of this director's work.\n",
      "This was an excellent film. It keeps you intrigued throughout with many unusual occurrences and twists. Very clever film\n",
      "A good movie with no jarring flaws. The only trouble I have with it is that it could've been better. I'm guessing a lot of the film's subtlety is lost in translation because I wasn't overly impressed by all of the metaphors. I feel like I got a firm grasp of everything that went on and what it meant while I was watching and it hasn't left much of a lasting impression on me. I could be failing to see things but I wish it was a bit more dense. I kind of think the movie is a little overrated and think that some people like it so they can say they like foreign films.\n",
      "This movie has all the emotions. A must watch! The story is so simple yet so twisted. One of the best foreign movies I've watched.\n",
      "Why is it that foreign, sub-titled movies, get a higher rating? This was just a plain dumb movie. All hype - no substance. What was with that ending? Artsy-fartsy, wish-in-one-hand, crapolla? I actually liked the businessman's wife. I really hoped that ALL the leach's would be exposed for the skum they were, suffer miserably, and die. Society already rewards dishonesty, and the last thing I want to watch is some farce that almost justifies it.\n",
      "This is just an average movie with a sadistic story and with a sadistic message and no morale. The director here has made the villains into heroes . He is trying to show the world the good , decent and innocent people are the real paracite of the world just becuase they are rich. The director feels that being rich and having maids, cooks, teachers, drivers is being a paracite !!!!\n",
      "The villain family who is poor and cheap , they do not have any morals. They are souless beings. They just kill and lie to make themselves enter into a good man's home and his life.So here the bad people are shown as winners and good people are really nice but they are brutally killed and cheated.What is the motive or such filthy storyline. ???There is nothing special about the movie.I feel that those who give 10/10 are the people who feel that everything is fair in this world to rise at top .Do you want to set such example for your kids and future ???\n",
      "Put yourself as the rich guy shown in the movie, who dies brutal death without any reason . Do you feel the good vibes after seeing the movie??\n",
      "My first korean movie, and was a great surprise; No one can say this is not a good movie, but the ending and the director explanation about the themes is very disappointing. It's supposed to be another anti capitalism movie, but they failed miserably, only the leftists will relate with the parasite family.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" isn't just a film; it's a social commentary that probes class disparities, presenting a mirror to contemporary society. Bong's storytelling mastery navigates unexpected twists, ensuring a gripping experience that lingers long after the credits roll.The film's universal acclaim is well-deserved, as it earned not only the Palme d'Or but also widespread admiration for its originality. Composer Jung Jae-il's haunting score further enhances the emotional depth, making \"Parasite\" an immersive journey that transcends cultural boundaries. A resounding 5-star rating for a cinematic gem that challenges conventions and leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.\n",
      "Now I've watched hundreds of movies in my life and have felt many different emotions but this one was a masterpiece.When I was going into this movie my expectations were high seeing how highly rated it was, but, not only were my expectations met they were surpassed. For the two hours I sat watching this movie not once did I get slightly uninterested in the plot, I went through so many emotions during this movie and I was absolutely speechless during the whole movie. I could tell such hard work and thinking went into producing this and it turned out to be completely worth the watch.It is one of my favorites and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to watch a great movie.\n",
      "The visual style and mood of 2019's \"Parasite\" is perfect. The editing, the cinematography and the story all perfectly coincide with each other. This film is the perfect example of every single part of a piece of art fitting with its other components. With the precision and perfect aspect of the rich family, is the perfectly omnipotent framing, camera movement and composition of every single shot.The static nature of the camera for most of the film shows how normal and static the status of the family is, in contrast with the family that starts to work there. The family that takes the place of the housekeepers, driver and tutors are shot with more fluid and quicker camera movements, to convey their status and attitude.I could talk about this film for days, so I will finish this review by discussing the ending. The emotional nature of the families connections to one another is perfectly encapsulated through the last line, and the last scene. The emotional relevance of such a run down family now down on their luck and half killed is touching, and perfectly fits with the beginning of the film. The very last shot conveys this perfectly, with the same shot at the beginning being the same one that is at the end.\n",
      "Generally I'll avoid a foreign film, so was forced to engage in this. Thank goodness I agreed! It was absolutely brilliant. The hype is justified, so so good. It just works so well, cast great, acting great, story great. You can guess where it might be heading, clever, but then you will be super surprised. Order your takeaway and get watching.\n",
      "It was mildly enjoyable for 3/4 of the film, but the ending felt like another movie was spliced in. Very disappointing \"best picture\"....I can't explain why without spoilers, so I won't try.\n",
      "I'd read the great reviews but didn't know what to expect going into this and it just completely blew me away, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Highly recommend!!\n",
      "Well executed on many levels. But when a non english speaking film wins an Oscar for best picture, needles to say the expectations are really high, and for my money they did not reach all the way. Half way thru I felt it was promising, but the last half hour lowered the rating for me. Over all a good movie but no way nere fantastic.\n",
      "I gave this film two stars because although the story is garbage, it's beautifully filmed and the set design is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to the cinematographer and the set design people. That being said, I found the story to be trite, boring, predicable and disappointing. Caution, spoilers follow.The plot is nonsensical, the characters are clichés, and I'm not sure I understand the message the filmmakers are trying to convey. Is the film trying to illustrate the shallow banality and institutionalized cruelty of the wealthy class and the devastating plight of the word's poorest folks? Those points are well-illustrated by the flood, the rich husband's treatment of his employees, etc... but beyond that, the plot settles into your standard, formulaic series of predictable events, portraying the poor family as stupid, rage-filled, murderous, half-wit psychopaths. Are the filmmakers trying to say that their murderous rage is justified or that poor people are just too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions? The poor family in the story are criminals, but they go about their criminal activity with all the calculation of an 8 year old. They are buffoons whose undoing follows a series of bad decisions, cons and assaults that are carried out with no forethought whatsoever.This idea, so popular among the entertainment elites, that the rich are horrible people (excluding themselves of course) and that the poor are noble savages, seems to inform an awful lot of character motivation and plot development. It's a common trope here in Hollywood and I guess their overseas counterparts have learned from the best. If Hollywood has taught us anything it's that stereotypes and recycled stories are what the public wants. After all, filmmakers usually don't portray life as it really is, rather, they portray life as imagined by a privileged elite who write and produce this nonsense. From their perspective inside the bubble, Hollywood has spent billions of dollars over the years to bring us clichéd tropes such as:\"The hooker with a heart of gold who, by the story's end will be rescued by a rich, handsome millionaire,\" and,\"The wise, world-weary black sidekick, who guides the white protagonist and serves as his conscience, but who sadly must die near the end of the film,\" and,\"The white-savior schoolteacher who is determined to 'make a difference' and ultimately is able to 'reach her students' through a combination of white-lady-tough-love, mime work, hip hop and interpretive dance, transforming a ragtag bunch of inner-city HOC (Hoodlums of Color) into Rhodes scholars.Maybe filmmakers outside the US have learned from the pros, and maybe they got it right, judging from the number of folks who rated this film highly and the fact that it won the Best Picture award.On some level, I find this film offensive and am disappointed that so many have jumped on the bandwagon and rated it highly. Having personally known many wealthy people and many poor people, I cannot reach the filmmaker's conclusion that the rich are cruel and indifferent and the poor are stupid and violent. I've also, unfortunately, personally known several murderers. They were cold, unfeeling sociopaths and when you looked into their eyes you saw an abyss. Nobody home. But they were not motivated by righteous outrage at an unjust system. None of them were poor. They weren't rich either. From a socioeconomic perspective, all the murderers I've known were people who had decent jobs, plenty to eat, new clothes, cell phones, access to credit, all of them were white, and people they murdered were from socioeconomic backgrounds almost exactly like their own. I watched this film to see if it lived up to its hype. Sadly, it turned out to be just one more piece of garbage, no better than most of the junk made in Hollywood. What a waste of time.\n",
      "It is excellent!This movie is fantastic.The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money. Min-hyuk, a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, pose as a university student to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks.Thanks alot.\n",
      "What does this film not talk about under the scenes? Increasing inequality, climate change, lack of compassion from some ultra-rich people... All such topics are touched upon. Yet, the film shines in the way the movie addresses all these issues. The director is a master in weaving entertaining narratives throughout seemingly mundane lives. He thrills and entertains us throughout the film. Finally, he lets us go after delivering a masterpiece of a climax! You will be left thinking about this film for ages.\"Age of Empires\" fans do enjoy the references about the naval ship formations in the chair arrangement of the final party. Maybe \"The Admiral: Roaring Currents\" fans as well, haha. Only one scene feels forced - the one with the driver character's unnatural anger with having to play a native tribesman for entertaining his boss' son. The emotions here feel a bit out of place as previously the driver was more than happy to be so well cared for and no visible tension was shown between them. We are left to assume that he feels bad that his dignity is hurt in the enactment. Yet, this feels like a mis-step in this otherwise masterly crafted film. Ultimately, this anger boils over to the finale. So, I'm a tad bit disappointed that the depth was not addressed here. Maybe this choice was made to keep the film taut and of a short running time.As a whole, this film is worth watching and is almost flawless in its presentation! Definitely a must-watch for anyone from anywhere living in this post-Covid world too.\n",

      "This is a film that blew me away the first time I saw it. That being said this is a film that demands a second watch - if not more - because there are so many little details that you either miss or they don't sink in the first time you watch the film. Moreover, it should be specified that this time I was viewing the black and white edition which beautifully highlights the film's production and style; it adds a certain layer of unease to the picture. When we first see the Park's house shrouded in shadows and darkness we know full well what's to come and it's almost like the film knows that too.The house is beautiful and it's astounding that the lower level and the interior is built from scratch (the second level being CG, not that you'd notice). The house when looked at in black and white can almost be seen as a gothic castle from classic literature or some of the early Universal horror films. But what I really find unsettling is the iceberg aspect of the house; it's almost too spacious and it feels much bigger on the inside than it does on the outside; it's a maze of materialism which is a stark contrast to the semi-basement that the Kim clan live in - another benefit of seeing the film in black and white is that it accentuates the differences between the families who are all parasites in their own right, the Kim family infiltrate a household and live off of the hosts without them knowing while the Parks have to rely on everyone in their family to function. It's also worth noting that there are enough chairs around the table in the Park's kitchen to sit everyone and yet there is still a very clear rich/poor divide. Ultimately, the Park's disconcerting house makes the architect Namgoong one of the most interesting characters in the film despite the fact he's never seen apart from the odd photograph that decorates the house.I'm not entirely sure if I feel the same way I do about this version of the film as I do with the colour version, simply because the black and white cinematography helps to present the film as an unconventional horror film about the ignorance of the upper classes, greed, fate and the ambition of those below them. One of the most blatant examples of the rich living in ignorance is when Park's wife is shopping for Da Song's birthday party and she remarks that the rain was a blessing; we now this not to be the case as we saw the Kim's semi-basement flooded with sewage water and many more families having to sleep on the floor of a gym. It's a subtle indication that if the Park's are simple enough to not see the problems of society below their castle on the hill then it's unsurprisingly that they wouldn't notice it happening in their own household.At a base level, there's nothing more terrifying than the thought of someone (an intruder) living in your house without you knowing. Thusly, there was nothing more horrifying than noticing the light sensors turn on as Nathan Park ascends the stairs of his home - as we know what he does not - that there is a parasite living in the hidden basement operating the lights via a system of switches. This is one of the reasons why the film has to be seen more than once as it's even better going into it knowing everything that's going to happen. The subtle references Park makes to Kim about his former housekeeper eating enough for two come off as a joke upon first viewing but the second time around that off-hand remark cannot be viewed as anything but deeply sinister.The last thing that can be commented on is fate, the importance of the scholar's rock and viewing Ki Woo (Kevin) as the film's main character. Each member of the Kim family is unsatisfied with their surroundings but the only one who actively seeks to change their position within society is Ki Woo: Kim is content to adapt to his surroundings, Chung Sook is cynical and only tries so hard to make a change, while Ki Jung has skills of her own and has worked in the past to earn money for herself. The siblings are the schemers but fate intervenes to the aid of one while abandoning the other.The scholar's rock which is said to bring material wealth to the owners is a constant in this film; as the Kim family sat encircled around their table the rock is seen in the background as the camera pans around the family, it has a domineering presence within the film, somewhat like Chekov's gun as the rock will be used as a weapon and the family will pay a price for the material gains they so briefly held. The rock is almost like a plot device as Kevin is undoubtedly the possessor of the rock as seen when he clutches it to his chest in the gym following the flood; he is the one who makes the Faustian deal as the materialist lifestyle he strives for comes at a price a la the monkey's paw tale.While the ending is left somewhat ambiguous despite the fact that director Bong Joon Ho states the likelihood of Ki Woo earning enough money to buy the Park's house in the future is practically impossible, I feel different looking at the ending this time around. It almost seems too easy to look at the sequence of the Kim family reunion as a ghost scene much like the family reunion scene in The Host (another work in Bong Joon Ho's filmography). To me, it would be a much more satisfying and still horrifying ending that during the climax the three surviving members of the Kim clan are reunited but the Faustian consequence of Ki Woo's possession of the rock meant that he gets everything he ever wanted - to be rich - but it comes at the price of the death of his sister, the mental torture of his mother, the captivity of his father and all of the other bloodshed that occurred at Da Song's party. You can look at the ending in both ways with this in mind: if Ki Woo purchases the Park's old house and is now a member of the elite, was it worth the price? And if this is just another ghost sequence and it never happens, was any of it all worth it in the first place? A taste of what it was like to be rich was very costly to the Kim family. A price that doesn't discriminate as it was the hamartia that led to the fall of the Parks.All I can say at this point is there is no limit to the number of times that someone should watch this movie. It's a masterwork that'll get better every time you see it.\n",
      "Curiosity about this film - two families - one very rich and entitled and one very poor with little hope for the future. The poor family appear to be street smart and the rich just more entitled. Slowly the entire family become entwined with the rich based on lie after lie.\n",
      "As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens.\n",
      "The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home.\n",
      "The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not.\n",
      "I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no.\n",
      "The crossroads the characters find themselves at are just crazy! Half-way through, you suddenly feel like you're watching a different movie. And it draws you in completely no matter how badly you sometimes just want to look away. Parasite absolutely deserved all the awards it won. Great filmmaking.\n",
      "There is a house on a hill, and there are people in it. And they're nice, but not really. There is a garden, and there they get a lot of sunlight. And it is nice, and they get to sleep there sometimes.There is a house underground, and there are people in it. And they're the first to tell you that they're not very nice: they're con-men, grifters, forgers and imposters. They sit among stink bugs, and they've been there for so long that maybe they've convinced themselves that they just belong there.There is a rock, and it is a gift, but it is also a burden. And maybe it's a metaphor, but it's also just a rock: solid and heavy, difficult to lug around, and dangerous in the wrong hands. Some people will tell you that it's supposed to bring wealth. But again, it's also just a rock.There is a line, and it cannot be crossed.There is a smell, and it comes from the underground. And the people who live in the house on the hill can smell it. And the people who live underground try to imagine a life in the sun, a future where they aren't just garbage to be washed away in the rain. But there is a smell that sticks to them, and they know that they can never really belong.There is a world, and it is nice, but not really. There are houses on hills, and houses underground. There is plenty of sun, but it isn't for everybody. There are people grateful to be slaves, and people unhappy to be served. There are systems that we are born into, and they create these lines that cannot be crossed. And we all dream of something better, but we've been living with these lines for so long that we've convinced ourselves that there really isn't anything to be done.There is a knife. And it doesn't do much in the long run, but there will always be some satisfaction in crossing some lines.\n",
      "Everyone praises thuis film for iets stylistic richness. Hype hype hurray. The truth is it lacks any tone at all. It is immature and silly. There is no chance of any identification. The rich people are immensely stupid, falling for the simplest tricks in the book. The poor are crafty but no more. The plot is farcical. Worst moment: the rich couple are starting what might be sex with three of the poor family under the tea table. The lights go on! They slide to safety. Someone is banging morse code on a light switch with his forehead.\n",

      "Is this serious satire about rich and poor? Are you kidding? Maybe of the South-Korean kind, where superficiality reigns. It is an immature product of an immature director. The acting is childish and over the top. The camerawork is great. But that is where it ends. Awful.\n",
      "An interesting and unusual plot. Excellent atmosphere. The film shows the hypocrisy and ingratitude of people. I also liked that there is no cliche in the film, such as: The rich - evil, greedy, cold-blooded and smug or The poor - kind, brave and sensitive. The biggest minus is the ending. I expected something more interesting and unusual. The end was predictable.\n",
      "I have a lot of mixed feelings about 'Immaculate'. It did some stuff I really liked, but then let itself down in other areas. It kept the jump-scares to a minimum, but the ones it did have were pretty easy to spot and ineffectual. It had a lot of gory and hard to watch scenes which were pretty effective and probably when the film was at its strongest. It also contained a fake-out dream sequence which is my most hated horror trope. For everything this film did well it seemed to do something else to offset it.Esta pelicula me hace querer vivir mas porque supuestamente para mi la vida no tenia sentido pero gracias a estas peliculas es que me estoy animandi mas a vivir.\n",

This film isnt a ground breaking once in a lifetime masterpiece but it is beautifully shot, acted and written. With any film, I think you must give some room to believe the unbelievable. It's a movie. It's meant to entertain, to move, to inspire, to question. People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think. For me, personally, it was meant to leave us torn. In a place where no real sides were taken, so that we question it constantly, never really reaching a definitive stance. The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be, simultaneously.\n",

      "I'll be the first to admit that much of my lack of enthusiasm for this film is totally my own doing. When this first came out and won Best Picture and everything, I was determined to not have anything spoiled, so that meant I have avoided EVERYTHING about this movie since late 2019/early 2020. But I still constructed this whole idea of what it was in my mind, and because of that, I was far more interested in the story I'd created than what was actually on display. And like I said, that's one hundred percent my bad.But that's not the only reason this was so disappointing to me. The biggest detractor was the characters. I honestly didn't really like any of them, and the more tolerable ones were still not the kind of characters I want to root for. I had great empathy for Ki-taek and his family, but I didn't like them. It was kind of fun at first to see them dupe this overwhelmingly oblivious rich family, but as soon as I actually started to think about it, it made me uncomfortable. I know it's satire and everything, but seriously, why are we punishing the people who didn't do anything wrong? Why send the driver and the housekeeper to potentially face the same situation you yourselves are so desperate to get out of? Don't get me wrong, I'm not on the side of the rich family either; they had plenty of issues. But it felt like the movie was trying to make excuses for Ki-taek and his family when they didn't deserve it. I mean, seriously, kicking the housekeeper down the stairs? Tying up her husband even when he begs to just keep living in the bunker? I just couldn't even pretend to be on their side.Ki-jung's death also really bothered me, since they'd gone out of their way to mention earlier that she seems to \"fit in\" with this lifestyle. So...was that her punishment? Because she could take this lifestyle in such stride, she ended up dead? Because she could be so easily seen as part of this rich life, she had to end up suffering? Maybe I'm looking too much into it, but either way, I didn't like it.And maybe it's as simple as it just comes down to the fact that I might not be the target demographic for this film. Who knows?I thought the cinematography was great and the writing was excellent, as well as the acting. I absolutely won't tell anyone not to watch it, and I might even recommend it. But overall, I was just really expecting a very different story (my own fault) and more relatable characters. I wanted so badly to give this at least an 8, but I honestly haven't been this disappointed in an \"objectively great\" film in a very long time. I'm glad that so many people adore it, but it's not for me.\n",
      "This movie just wasn't for me. It's very symbolic, which means you can interpret almost every scene and give it some special meaning. But at the end of the day it was such a strange movie with characters that weren't likable at all, and whatever message it tried to convey, it wasn't doing it in an appealing way. I feel like this is one of those movies suddenly everyone is talking about and so it became bigger than it deserved. And that comes from someone who admired Korean movies for almost a decade now.\n",
      "Being a Korean language film was not the only reason Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' was an unlikely multiple Oscar winner; it's also unusually dark. A vicious black comedy, it tells the story of an impoverished family who think they've found a meal-ticket for life when they manage to displace the servants of a gullable rich one; but it turns out they're not the only desparate people in town. Everyone can enjoy its ingenious plot and wonderful sense of aesthetic; but at heart, this is a serious film about how both wealth and poverty corrupt the soul. As such, it has no heroes; and its victims are either not innocent, or, if they are, have no right to be. There's no question it deserved it's awards.\n",
      "The review by FNG of Parasite is a rockin' piece of cinema appraisal that really precludes my struggle to offer a more useful review! God knows this piece will not be bested by other than professional reviewers like the best ( Pauline Kael ) it requires the intellect of an afficionado who has already left the mortal-coil stage bereft. Absorb that User Review and understand what it means to appreciate great film making!!\n",
      "\"Parasite\" appears as one of the masterpieces of master director Bong Joon-ho. While this Korean film deals with deep issues such as class differences, social injustice and family dynamics, it also impresses the audience with its absurd sense of humor.\"Parasite\", whose script is superbly crafted, skillfully criticizes today's social structure. The movie is about the Kim family, a poor family, infiltrating a rich family as servants. However, as a result of unexpected events, everything gets out of control and a tense journey begins.The depth of the characters and acting performances in the film are quite impressive. Members of the Kim family impress the audience with both dramatic and humorous narration. Additionally, the visual compositions and camera angles in the film are astonishing.In addition, \"Parasite\" makes the audience think with its examination of class differences. The film creatively addresses the gap between rich and poor and reveals how it affects and even transforms people's lives.In conclusion, \"Parasite\" attracts attention with both an excellent script and an impressive visual style. Bong Joon-ho's mastery makes the film a true masterpiece. It can be an experience to watch this film, which deeply affects the audience, makes them think and opens up discussion.\n",
      "It is simply beautiful. It is best to go into the movie with no knowledge of anything about it, and not having seen the trailers or read anything about it. Not having expectations made it much more exciting. I cannot recommend the movie enough, to really anyone who loves film and is willing to give it a chance. It won the Oscar for a reason. In my opinion, it very much deserved it.\n",
      "This is one of the most well written movies I've ever seen, it was just great! The camerawork was amazing. I also didn't expect this movie to be nearly as funny as it was even with subtitles I still laughed a fair amount. I really enjoyed this and only have one problem with this movie and it's not that bad, I wish the it ended a bit earlier, just a few minutes. Besides that the only reason I don't give this a 10/10 isn't because I thought it was worse than others, I just won't give anything a 10/10.\n",
      "Wow! Wow! I mean... wow! First time watching it you think it's a black comedy that is a masterpiece! The second time you see the layers beneath, it's structured in a way that makes it soooooooo amazing. Third time, well third time it's just a masterpiece again!\n",
      "It's a good movie. But nothing so great. LOBBYING SHOULD BE BANNED in any film award process for impartial decisions.\n",
      "Parasite is like no film I have seen before, for a very long time, despite enjoying it, I was questioning just what this film was. There was comedy, obvious drama and a little romance too, but it all accumulates into a thriller. It's surreal, but brilliant.Overall, Parasite is a stark commentary on the class divide within Korea, yet it doesn't paint either extreme as the lesser, the evil, or impose certain stereotypes. The difference in lifestyle and mindset is evident, yet putting these two seemingly amiable families in the same space displays the ultimate division. It's difficult film to explain to another, yet it's apparent why it won the Oscar for Best Film. Watch it, I don't see how anyone could be disappointed by it.\n",
      "Didn't even know why this movie is so overrated,\n",
      "Fell asleep watching this.\n",
      "After watching Parasite, it's hard to describe what I felt when \"Kevin\" finished writing the letter for his father. The film itself is entertaining to watch, it keeps you thinking and when you look for the deeper meaning within, you find a hard theme to display on a screen yet done brilliantly in Parasite.\n",
      "In my opinion the movie is a direct metaphor for dreams, and even for the concept of the \"American Dream\". In the film, the \"Kim\" family is struggling from the beginning, they have dreams, especially Ki-Woo (Kevin) and his sister (Ki-Jeong) to go to college. When Kevin heads out to his job interview with the Parks, he tells his family that he doesn't think of the forgery of the documents as a crime. He is just getting these documents before time, because he will go to college. His sister also seems like she wanted to go to college and seems frustrated that she couldn't because of their situation. At the end of the film, Kevin imagines himself overcoming and finally having money after he went to college. He then would be able to buy the house where his dad would still be trapped in the basement room. The sad part about this is that Kevin really thinks he will be able to save his father, but because of what has happened, he won't be able to.\n",
      "An interesting metaphor used inside the film is how the levels in the different houses represent the social classes. For example, to get to the Park's house the Kims had to walk up a hill, and to get back to their house they had to walk back down a long way. Even inside the Park's house this can be seen with the hidden basement room, in which one of the \"parasites\" lives.\n",
      "The film for me started out almost as a comedy, all of the sequence in which the family works together to fire the Park's workers in order for them to be hired is great and I really had fun watching it. Where it all changes is when the two \"parasites\" face off against each other to stay on the surface (literally and figuratively), while the losers are thrown back inside the basement. From this point the whole movie changes dramatically and it all goes downhill, as represented by the flooding of their apartment. What really seems interesting to me is how when the Parks were at their highest point; dining and drinking acting like they own the place is when their downfall begins. This probably represents how in many cases the social class lines are set and those below don't belong above.\n",
      "Mr. Parker is the one who is above all the others, he is the man of the house. In two occasions Mr. Kim tells Parker that he loves his wife, to which the first time Mr. Parker responds, \"we'll call it love\". This probably shows that in truth he doesn't love her and the only thing that he really loves is well, money and power. In an intimate scene between the two, at a point Mr. Parker looks even uncomfortable adding more to why I believe he doesn't love her at all.\n",
      "When the Kims first meet the Parks they think between themselves that they are nice people and look at them as their equals. This all changes in the scene where they become trapped underneath the table and overhear Mr. Park telling his wife how Mr. Kim smells like radishes with great disgust, as if he weren't even human at all. This greatly upsets Mr. Kim, as if this smell makes him less than them. Later, this explains the reason for him killing Mr. Park in the final act of the film.\n",
      "Overall, the film is complete and a realistic portrait of a struggle between classes and a commentary on how not everyone can accomplish their dreams because of how our society is built. It has various moods that I honestly really liked, from the comedic, to the dark and psycho parts of the film. The thing that this film has made me think the most about though, is the dreams part, because that can come like a brick to the face, to know that what you want the most in the world might not come to you.\n",
      "While Parasite spends a good amount of time on comedy, it nonetheless presents an extremely nuanced take on the struggle of Rich Vs. Poor, with neither side painted as entirely good or entirely bad.\n",
      "There is a strong sense of moral contortion throughout the story. The rich did nothing wrong but people hate them.The poor swindle and wield a knife, but you may feel sorry for them.\n",
      "This movie is full of suspense and thriller, drama, crime and many movie, that's why it got an Oscar award. Must Watch!\n",
      "An impressively constructed South Korean film. The lives of the rich and poor become entangled leading to disaster outs consequences. Top marks for cinematography, as well as the underlying dark and relatable theme shown throughout the movie. Parasite definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it.\n",
      "If you didn't like it because of the subtitles, stop watching movies :(\n",
      "Cinematography was amazing in this film. Very good acting.. the plot for me was really weak... I felt like I was watching an episode of Black mirror that was an 1 hour to long. I think this was a little over hyped and overrated. Of all the AMAZING foreign films out there I feel like saying this is \"masterpiece\" is a slap in the face. Still a solid film. I won't watch it again though.\n",
      "A technically flawless film, director Bong Joon-ho has created a modern film classic that, not only transcends the language and cultural barriers separating it from the rest of the world, but has resonated on such a level allowing it to take home multiple Academy Awards at the 2019 ceremony, including the coveted \"Best Picture\" award. Kudos Mr. Bong Joon-ho.Kudos.\n",
      "In the opening scene of Parasite, a family struggles to get the WiFi signal in their phone. Ki-Woo gets on top of the shelf and manages to catch the singal. This scene describes the entire film: a family of poor people trying to reach the top. They devise a cunning plan and the entire family gets into the house of a rich family, fooling them in the process. What follows is a story that sometimes struggles to maintain a brisk pace.\n",
      "The film is loaded with metaphors. Beneath all those metaphors, is the concept of disparity between the poor and the rich. The rich, oblivious to the plight of the people who work under them, continue to lead a life sucking on the blood of the poor. This is shown in the scene where a man hiding in the basement of the house of Mr. Park switches on the lights in the stairs everyday when Mr.Park comes home. Mr.Park however believes that is the work of the motion sensors.\n",
      "There is even the fight among the poor to get their hands on the wealth of the rich. The entire second half of the film is not about the tensions between the Parks and their servants. It is between two groups of servants of the family, each trying to suppress the other.\n",
      "The idea that the Parks live in a house unaware of a man living in their basement is an allusion to the perpetual, simmering tensions between the working class and the affluent.\n",
      "The final moments of the film are a complete mess with violence and bloodshed. Critics of Joker should have spoken about this too. The hate the poor have towards the rich is more pronounced in this film than in Joker.\n",
      "Leaving aside the social commentary, the pacing of the film is very irregular. There are scenes that bursts with energy and freshness and there are those that test the patience. Also, the reason why Mr.Park gets killed is obscure. May be, Kang-Ho song was pushed to his limit. May be, Mr.Park crossed the line, which Kang-Ho song didn't. May be he was anguished when his daughter gets stabbed. May be, it is the combination of all those reasons.\n",
      "Parasite is a disturbing film that will leave an indelible mark on you. Still, the screenplay loses its focus in a many scenes.\n",
      "Overrated, don't see what people are seeing in this movie to rate it with a 10\n",
      "A roller coaster of a movie with great characters and plot twists. A narrative that draws you in from start to end. A movie to add to all time favorites.\n",
      "Such a breathtaking movie! Both in terms of script, acting and look of the film. It's beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. Some really great twists and turns and unexpected moments.Admittedly I've only ever watched one other thing from Korea and that is the latest Squid Games. This movie is made me want to watch more Korean movies.\n",
      "Parasite, a South Korean cinematic gem, masterfully unravels the complex layers of class divide and human nature from an Asian perspective. With its intricate storytelling and stunning visuals, it delves deep into themes of ambition, desperation, and the struggle for survival, resonating strongly with Asian audiences. This film not only offers a gripping narrative but also reflects on the societal structures and the stark realities of wealth disparity in Asia. Its profound impact on viewers highlights the universal relevance of its themes, making Parasite a pivotal work in global cinema that engages and enlightens.\n",
      "This whole movie was amazing, from start to end. The story is just so well done and it NEVER gets boring. I watched this for the second time like 5 months ago or something! But it just can't leave my head. From the storytelling to the cinematography it's a 10 for sure!! Probably the best Korean movie of all time. The plot is not even that complicated, but it's still so so so interesting and I promise that your eyes will never leave the screen. One of my personal favourite parts is definitely the ending, it was mind blowing. I could have never thought of the father being trapped in the house's basement communicating in morse code through the lights, just like the previous man, and it just leaves you with so much mistery. And the thrilling was on point, the part where we see the man in the basement get to the basements door and look at the child while he's eating his birthday cake haunted me for days. I love love love Parasite.\n",
      "The movie is so like realistic and entertaining,\n",
      "I love the suspense and the acting is good and the story is so good.\n",
      "It has a message to tell and the surprise is 50/50 kinda expected it but I like the overall movie.\n",
      "Even if the parasite is high, the smell of poverty cannot be removed\n",
      "Second half is very boring and ending is even more\n",
      "Racists can stay pressed. Best movie of all time and deserved even more Oscars.\n",

      "This film is the best. Every hidden message respectively meshes together for a mind blowing theme throughout the film. You can definitely see the directors were passionate about this. Don't listen when people say reading the sub isn't worth it because it is.\n",
      "This film starts out like a comedy but gets pretty dark. I can definitely see Bong's signature style that we can also see in Snowpiercer, especially the social satire. Both of the families in this film have their own issues that really come out. The main point is the overall setting, portrayed visually through the architecture. Everyone is trapped by the class system and cannot escape except by ruthlessly attacking each other for what amounts to not much in the end.\n",
      "Funny, Dark, Weird, Wonderful, Predictable, unpredictable.This movie literally had everything!I was't even sure I could do two hours + of subtitles, but it was easy in the end. Nice fast pace, bits of humour and bits of darkness.Nothing not to like, whatever genre of picture you prefer.\n",
      "When I watched this film I was impressed and I really liked it, but I wasn't blown away. I left after seeing it thinking \"yeah, I get it,\" but after sleeping on it I really found myself understanding the film properly. The way it's written is exceptional, and I'd never seen anything quite like it; the seamless jumps between genre really caught me off guard. I never knew what to expect, and going into the film without knowing a thing about it, I was pretty shocked. From comedy to thriller, I was on the edge of my seat.\n",
      "The thing that really sold me on it being a good film, however, was the ending. Sad, hopeful, but ultimately a fantasy. A bitter, bitter fantasy. I mean, what a way to end! I will say, though, that there were about ten times while watching that I was expecting the credits to roll...Ultimately, this probably wouldn't be my first choice when sitting down to watch a movie, nor would I normally choose to go see a film like this is theatres, but boy did I enjoy it! I think everyone should, at some point in their life, see this film, but I don't think everyone will enjoy it.\n",
      "First half is good second half is just very good. But not perfect. Ending seems bland and it seems director wanted to just buildup to that birthday part violence and start movie credits.and this topic \"class conflict\" , why the hell Oscars always fanboys to this topic. Some people don't like these topics but you give a movie a Oscar and world will watch it. It was a simple good drama thriller that i wont bother to watch again(most probably). Some of the movie parts were 10/10 but only some. So i would give it a 8/10. I think its fair. And Symbolism in this movie is Dumb.\n",
      "Parasite on a building-site... I think this is one of the greatest films of all-time, when viewed in a mirror. Then you can see how honest the director has been. The actors with their performances their product-placement. Top-notch all round. Five stars!!!!!\n",
      "Is there another film that so amply condenses modern film trends the way Parasite does? Is there another film that has garnered so much rapt acclaim as Parasite? Has any other film in recent years struck straight to the heart of modern filmgoers, even striking a chord with most Americans despite its stature as a foreign film? No.Objectively speaking, I'm a bit surprised at the acclaim piled onto this film. It starts out innocuously enough (you naturally relate to the poor family, the Kims) but quickly turns into an orgy of such unrelieved nastiness it makes Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole look tame. And this is a full hour before the characters start bludgeoning and stabbing each other to death.What is there to like? It's well directed, certainly, (like many modern films); the architecture of the rich Park family's home is quite aesthetically pleasing; and there are a few effective moments of dark suspense. But it's all soaked in pure bile; this is essentially a story of a conniving poor family duping and destroying a foolish rich one to get ahead in life. There's no sign of redemption for these characters, barely any remorse even, and once they show their true colors it's impossible to root for their success. Bong doesn't have the same moral outlook as, say, Scorsese, so there's a complete lack of escalation; the lies don't accumulate more than just providing opportunities for awkward humor, the violence leads to more violence without affecting the character's psyches.The utter lack of moral thought is part of why this film appeals to modern audiences, as well as the theme of 'class conflict' which is popular since it is the only way that modernity can justify the kind of actions we witness here. (Overall, I'd assume the main market for Parasite is rich people who convince themselves that they're poor at heart or at least sympathetic to the poor. Then they can see the Kims and Parks as abstractions instead of human beings).I admit I know next to nothing about life in South Korea; it could very well be just as Hobbesian as Bong depicts it here. (That doesn't change the fact that he's an American celebrity; this guy is way too successful at this point to convince as a nihilist). But no, it starts out as people urinating on the Kim's house and culminates in a giant flood where the characters flounder about amid exploding toilets and oceans of excrement. Truly, this is modern film art taken to its fullest.To his credit Bong keeps a tight leash on the plot, only unleashing a ridiculous sequence of events in the closing scenes, sacrificing logic in favor of absurd contrivances to wrap everything up. After committing murder in the violent climax, Mr. Kim hides in the Park's empty home, signaling (in Morse code, using light fixtures) a long letter addressed to his son. He apparently does this every day for weeks despite not even knowing if his son is still alive, which is bizarre beyond belief. What's even crazier is that the son does recover from his injuries, does see the message, and composes a reply (how he will deliver it we do not know).\"I have a plan\" he says. \"I'll go to work, I'll make money, then I will buy the house so we can be together again\". Gee, dude, you don't say, maybe it would have been better to do all that in the first place instead of lying and destroying your way to the top.\n",
      "I was told before that this movie will surprise me with things i may expect. So even with this information i was totally stunned in some scenes. It's going more and more wired but you can't stop watching.First it's all about the poor and the rich. You can feel this huge gap between the families but this movie is so much more than that. Don't think to much, enjoy the ride and pls don't watch it with your kids!Cheers\n",
      "Fletcher\n",
      "Parasite is an excellent work by Korean director Bong Joon Ho, whose talent I have long admired since I saw THE HOST over ten years ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, though mostly more ups than downs, but this movie is arguably his masterpiece. It is a quiet and reflective work, his mature work playing the role of a parable that deals with class division in a caustic and highly revealing manner. The issue is universal, which is why the film did so well overseas (and at the Oscars), even though I've been an advocate for the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical quality is exemplary, the acting is particularly striking, and the unusual storyline develops to an unexpected climax. A film that not only entertains but also makes you think.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this film, however it certainly isn't enough for a ten, nor do I think it's as good as people like to say it is. Nothing to do with the second half or anything really, I just believe it was a very good film, awesome idea, cool characters and pretty much great execution, it's just not the immense best film ever as I've seen some people refer it like, almost a ten, but not quite. I think Korean films such as these are one of the best in the industry of film, and if that doesn't make you want to watch it then I don't know what will. Definitely watch this film it has some shocking bits in and was very entertaining.\n",
      "Basking in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing the air in the dark room will only walk like a ghost. Poverty on the stone can not be removed for life, smell of cheap can never be removed for good. The bedbug that curdles underground, with medicated open a window to sterilize oneself; The host at the top pays someone to sterilize himself. The rich suck the blood of the poor rise, the poor send in the house of the rich survive, people and ghosts share food in one room, insect and beast parasitic body development enmity.\n",
      "Even reading captions did not take anything away from me enjoying this movie thoroughly! The twist and turns and bitter ironies! The one moment in the timeline that flipped everything. One minute conning your way into good fortune to doing something completely stupid and turning good fortune to an absolute nightmare.\n",
      "This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life.This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat, even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing. The suspense is quite chilling, and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end. It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching.\n",
      "This is the worst joke I have ever seen. 😢 When I saw that \"1917\" did not win I just had to watch this. Had such high hopes. I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a while, but this has nothing on Oldboy or even Mother. A win over Mendes' masterpiece just makes the Oscars the worst awards for cinema in the world (which btw was showing for a couple of decades now). Sad! 😢\n",
      "The 2019 Academy Award-winning movie \"Parasite\" was a game-changer in the movie industry. Aside from all the awards won and records being broken, this movie defined its genre and completely changed my idea of what a movie could be. This film has been generally described as a thriller and comedy while at the same time addressing the role of different social classes and how this affects the world. Following a young man on his adventure to create income for his family, the movie takes the audience through his journey where he is introduced to a high-income family and lands a job as the daughter's tutor while helping his sister gain a job as the nanny. The young man begins to create a connection with the daughter, and his parents also start to invade with jobs. The secretive takeover of this other family begins to fall apart for the young man, and a secret is discovered that will make you jump. The twist alone is crazy enough to gain this movie a good review but combined with amazing movie-making, as well as a boundary-breaking script that left me constantly engaged I have to give \"Parasite\" 10 stars.\n",
      "A good movie with an appealing enough plot that has some interesting twists. However, nothing justifies a Best Picture award: No outstanding performances, no memorable soundtrack, not even the sets/photography are good enough to leave a lasting impression.\n",
      "Plain and simple its a solid script that entertains for its duration, with a somewhat critical view of society which people who think of themselves as movie critics will cling on to justify that this movie can win Best Picture award, especially being paired up against Joker and 1917, both of which are vastly superior in every aspect.\n",
      "How did this win best picture????? The ending was nothing special and the storyline didn't make sense. Not a good film in general and to think that this won best picture, TRAVESTY!!! I saw this and Cats(2019) in the same day... and cats was WAY better. At least in cats it was visually entertaining, this doesn't have anything to show for. Would not recommend and still don't know what the hype is about. Save yourself time and money and skip this film!!!!!\n",
      "A very entertaining movie that focused on the social issues in Korea. Nowadays it is very rare to see a film like Parasite, that conveyed its message so well, yet still able to be entertaining throughout the whole film.Overall, this movie is a must watch.\n",
      "Nice movie, good story, good acting.I would recommend it\n",
      "This movie didn't disappoint! Everything felt original and it took a disturbing twist towards the end. The theme of the movie was clear from the get go! Overall great movie and I would watch again!\n",
      "Parasite is actually very artistic in the way it essential splits into two movies. The first half of the movie focuses on the family's strengths and successes, is more lighthearted and could be described as more of a comedy. The plot twist happens at the exact halfway point to the minute where the underlying plot is revealed. The tone dramatically shifts to become more serious, uneasy, and dark. The second half of the movie is more of a drama and horror slasher with a series of violent deaths and sad truths uncovered. The class divide becomes more evident and while the first half of the movie was more hopeful, the second half feels more hopeless.\n",
      "Extremely overhyped, or maybe I was expecting too much. Expected a lot more from the film, but I feel like if you're going to watch it without high expectations, then the movie slaps hard.\n",
      "The film is wellmade in many aspects and maybe it deserves its Oscars this year. Certainly it is about time to award the Oscar for a film performed in another language than english. But it is not close to a masterpiece. It does not measure up to films like A Separation, Life is beautiful, The Postman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many others films that deserved an Oscar for best picture.There are many other things this film is not. It is more a tragic horror movie and a deliberative reflection on class society than a comedy. There are no laughing moments in this film unless you have an extremely dark sense of humor. The acting is very uneven, sometimes brilliant and sometimes amateurish, and the script, even though it is certainly original and in many aspects wellwritten, has several obvious plotholes.\n",
      "I forgot I was watching a Korean movie. Was too captivated by everything that happened in the movie. Pitiful, comical, thrilling and horrifying. It's not simple to understand though. One can interpret in many ways.\n",
      "Anyone shud watch it in a lifetime.\n",
      "The whole point of this movie is that there is a crazy guy in the basement and he has to come out to kill everyone like some sort of reverse Frankenstein plot. Don't tell me about symbolism or the more deep-core messages in this movie when everyone in it is a damn CARICATURE, with each person filling the stereotypical roles like the dumb, rich housewife so that only one thing can develop: and that is the story. There is no part of the film where we see any real in-depth look at poverty coming from the mouths of the characters, only their superficial actions which lay against a strict blueprint to propel the story forward to the climax which is the crazy guy coming out and killing everybody, So let's talk about the story: it's literally an infiltration movie, similar to heist movies like Ocean's 11 with much better cinematography. And this is where I give the movie an okay rating, because of the cinematography and overall directing which was done pretty well. Otherwise I don't see how people are raving that this is such a good movie, have they been hoodwinked by the fact that we've seen this all before with less stereotypical ways of depicting class struggles and character?\n",
      "Seriously a recycle piece of dreck that piggy backed off the writing off of others. I just feel it was the abcs of death g is for grampa, or amazing world of gumballs \"whose in the house\" it just got a dragnet treatment to avoid claims of plagerism.My main complaint is that their is never a suspension of disbelief. I cannot understand how a person can have another person living in one room and never know this. How these uber scary loan sharks never investigated the womans place of work for method of contacts. How a man could have a house in a flood zone and not have it checked for annually checked issues like bugs, vermin and other parasites along with potential waterdamage or radium cracks. Also since a ghost was spotted down there and they believe in it you think they would have had a monk/priest or hoodoo practitioner to kick its butt out. Sorry while the plot is interesting it only works if everyone involved has diminished capacity just like the people under the stairs by wes cravenBut hey if you like the movie enjoy it. Everybody has there own opinion this is just mine\n",
      "Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of the decade and my 2nd favorite film. It's not as simple as it looks. It has hidden meanings and metaphors. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the screenplay, all were excellent. I didn't see any flaws in them. Maybe, for the first time, a deserved movie won the oscar for best picture.So, the story is basically about how a poor family makes their way to become the servant of the rich family. Just like how a parasite attacks their host, they attack the rich's house. The whole film is filled with metaphors and easter eggs. You must watch at least 2 times to understand the hidden meaning. Well, even if it's in korean, the subs are okay and you can live up with em.The film tackle the class division with a satarical tone. It's a must watch\n",
      "I can't believe some people were complaining about having to watch with subtitles, they're missing out. We first get to know the two families at the start of film and as time passes, we wonder how long this relationship is going to last. This movie portrays the struggles the poor face and the obliviousness of the wealthy. At the same time, it manages to make us feel sorry for both of these families despite their class differences. Overall, great film to watch with the many perspectives and symbolism.\n",
      "Movie starts with a simple family story and slowly take it up for a ride and then a hard fall\n",
      "It is so much better to dive into this knowing nothing. I only watched the trailer prior to the movie and it shocked me after. Everything is stitched to perfection. Great commentary on society.\n",
      "End is dammmm horrible. There is nothing in the film to be afraid of but thinking about what happened in the movie scares you.it is great it may move youu a bit.\n",
      "\"Parasite,\" directed by Bong Joon-ho, tells the story of the Kim family, who live in poverty in a semi-basement apartment in Seoul. Their luck changes when their son, Ki-woo, gets a job as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family. One by one, the Kim family members infiltrate the Park household by posing as skilled professionals, exploiting opportunities and coincidences to secure their positions.The strength of \"Parasite\" lies in its plot, which is full of surprises and flows seamlessly. Bong Joon-ho masterfully blends elements of drama, comedy, and thriller to create a story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The narrative highlights the stark class divide between the Kim and Park families and explores how each family exploits the other for their gain.The actors deliver exceptional performances. Song Kang-ho, as Ki-taek, the father of the Kim family, portrays a man desperate yet determined with deep emotional nuance. Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, as Ki-woo and Ki-jung, stand out with their clever and opportunistic characters. Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong, as the Park family, provide a sharp contrast with their naivety and obliviousness to the harsh realities outside their luxurious life.The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is stunning. Each shot is meticulously planned, adding depth to the story. The use of space and lighting effectively illustrates the social and emotional contrasts between the two families. The production design further enhances this theme, with the opulent and modern Park house juxtaposed against the cramped and dingy Kim residence.\"Parasite\" offers a biting critique of social and economic inequality in contemporary society. Bong Joon-ho vividly depicts class differences and examines how these disparities influence human behavior and relationships. The film encourages viewers to reflect on issues of morality, injustice, and the human struggle for survival in an unfair system.In conclusion, \"Parasite\" is a masterpiece that entertains while provoking deep thought. With its clever plot, strong characters, and beautiful cinematography, the film effectively conveys profound social messages without being preachy. It is no surprise that the film has received widespread acclaim and numerous prestigious awards.As a critic, finding flaws in \"Parasite\" is challenging. Some viewers might find the moments of dark comedy and the plot twists to be excessive, but for many, these elements enhance the film's appeal and uniqueness.\n",
      "The movie is watchable, but a failure. The first part is slow but it builds up well. Still, when the things go down for the characters, the story goes down also. It had to end somewhere, I guess, but everything loses focus and probably the people taking it as a social statement are right.Anyway, I don't get the comedy of the first part. Probably the Korean style of drama is too exotic to me. And I surely don't get the oh, so common, gore and gratuitous violence that come with movies made by people living there.\n",
      "No need for a long review. This movie was just OK. I'm not impressed.\n",
      "This film is very nicely shot and had some entertaining moments in it. The cast are great and the story has some unexpected twists.Overall I would definitely recommend watching it, however I really can't understand how it won best picture and best director at the academy awards. In that sense the film is quite mediocre as it doesn't leave a lasting impression as most Oscar winning films do.My guess is the Academy lording diversity at the risk of social criticism.\n",
      "I don't understand the high praise and award at all. Even if you are poor, you shouldn't throw away your morality! Didn't the son score a job at pizza place at the very beginning of the movie? Isn't her sister good at photoshop and computer? Can't their chubby mom work as dishwasher or clothes washer? A lot of low income family in Indonesia do that. Instead of working hard, they conned their way into an innocent family!Sure, a movie protagonist shouldn't a good person all the time. But they should get retribution when they choose to be bad. In this movie, the father was never arrested for killing Mr. Park. The protagonist lost his sister, but they got what they deserve. They made the previous house maid lost her job. They killed her and almost kill her husband too.Mr. Park and his family is totally innocent. But they didn't get the justice in the end. What kind of movie is this? Rich people deserve to die from not treating the poor as equal human being? Nah. Mr. Park is normal. I have seen much much worse.Some people also mention how about protagonist father deserve to be mad during the final conflict. Hello, guys? What kind of father wouldn't prioritize his son who's having seizure? What kind of father would put a stranger's life before his son's life?Bad, bad movie, where moderately decent guy didn't get justice, and the murderous evil guy lives.\n",
      "Parasite is such a brilliant movie I have ever seen! I am in complete awe after watching this movie, definitely an Oscar winning movie. The story-line and acting both were good, director maintained a prefect control to the story throughout. It has comedy, drama and thriller as well.\n",
      "I had no expectations before watching Parasite, it's truly one of the best films of 2019. My love and affection for this film is just like every other great movies I've watched.\n",
      "The film also takes a dig at meritocracy, the humor in the film is quite outstanding. Kang-Ho Song has played his played his character with near perfection and the narration is just as good. All in all this is just a masterpiece!\n",
      "I have watched this film a total of three times now. First time with English subtitles and twice without. I have absolutely no idea what this movie is supposed to mean, but it feels like two social classes clashing against each other in a very strange yet interesting house.\n",
      "I'll admit that I have never seen a Chinese or Korean made movie until now and Parasite is the first film I've seen from Korea, but the sheer artistic direction and enigmatic structure of it all is incomparable to any other film I've seen come out of the year. A very select few movies that come to mind that has a plot structure or story direction style that I can relate or reference this\n",
      "I can only guess what the main theme or score of this movie is supposed to mean, I am listening to the music of the Blu-Ray menu as I'm typing this, trying to decode meaning from the notation structure of the short yet extremely memorable of this song. I'm still trying to decipher what emotion the theme is trying to convey. Could you say the film has a serious tone, it is hard to say?\n",
      "The movie definitely has a serious tone, with a very strong burst of violence in the final 15 minutes of the movie's running time, but the theme is surprisingly happy and carefree, even joyful, yet overshadowed by an ever lurking hint of sadness, that never lets go. The sadness melancholic feel of this movie is always present throughout, despite the emotional rollercoaster this surreal absurdist - drama/comedy film only known as \"Parasite\" takes you on\n",
      "This short theme is actually very true to emotion in real life. Melancholy can never fully be escaped from in so many facets of life. True happiness can only be achieved in fleeting moments and sometimes only in short bursts only to fall back into a stabilised state of emotional equality that is where most people reside in most periods of life. Never truly happy yet not depressed or sad. Simply reasonably content.\n",
      "The third light at the top of the stairs meaning to me is the unstoppable and indescribable drive to try and achieve a higher state of happiness beyond normal human comprehension. An emotional ascension, which can also be heard in the main theme is you really start to sit down and think about the music in the film, and start mulling over the notes in your head and how they really make you feel. How does the theme make you feel?\n",
      "Happy? Sad? Melancholic? Confused? Joyful? Maybe all at once. Maybe none of these emotions are good enough for you anymore. Did you ever think to yourself that you deserve a higher state of feeling that you always wanted but could never grasp?\n",
      "If there is such thing as an afterlife or heaven, how would the souls that live there feel like. I would expect It would be a higher state than what most of us experience in life.\n",
      "The rock to me is the object in the movie that symbolises the emotional weight which all the characters revolve around and are effected by which also radiates a strange gravitational like force that influences them, kind of like Sauron's Ring from LOTR but in a different way.\n",
      "The true form and meaning of happiness is something that is always in my mind when I think about this movie. What is happiness even supposed to mean and who out there is brave enough to say that modern society's definition of true happiness (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean) is just simply not good enough. The man in the basement is an enigma. He is a man trying to create and send a message of how to escape the confines and prison of being trapped inside the normal comprehension of human emotion. The balance between Joy, Depression, Melancholy, Depression, Fear and True Happiness.\n",
      "He cannot accept that true happiness, at least the way he feels it, is the best and highest form of happiness that a human mind can achieve. The three lights symbolise an upward stairway for the emotional mind. Emotional intelligence followed by ascension to a higher state of feeling and sustained happiness.\n",
      "Parasite also touches upon Schizophrenia is some parts and offers a quick window into what it might be like to suffer from Schizophrenia. The definition of Schizophrenia itself is simply \"a breakdown between thought, reason and emotion\"\n",
      "Funnily enough this movie is split between three genres. Absurdist/Surreal Comedy and Drama.\n",
      "The movie feels oddly split which is a purposeful directing choice which is the most obvious thing that you take away from this movie. The film could have been called \"Split\" to me and still would have not lost any of its impact, but unfortunately \"Split has already been taken by Shyamalan.\n",
      "Something of a parasite is formed in this movie, but what it is I still have no clue. Parasite IS going to be one of those movie's that is going to become exponentially better the more times you watch it which will not lose its interest, charm or unique appeal with repeated viewings. The film truly feels multidimensional in its direction and communication of its ideas that leaves massive room for the viewer to make their own interpretation of those so-called ideas and messages in the film. The movie at times has a very enigmatic feel, reminiscing of certain video games like Myst, Riven, Portal and Abduction. Parasite is an experience that is going to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people\n",
      "Anyway, what do I think of this movie in terms of quality? The answer is simple. 10/10\n",
      "This to me is minimalistic yet multidimensional filmmaking at its absolute finest and I really have no issues or gaping flaws that I have to say about it, It's pretty much as perfect as a modern movie gets and transcends so much that has came before it. I loved it. I loved every single goddamn minute of it and I don't even understand what I watched or even why I enjoyed it so much in the way I did. If you didn't enjoy it that is totally fine as well. It's one of those movies that is not going to be everyone's cup of tea and that is also okay. But to me, Parasite is the next step as we are beginning to experience a new advent in visual storytelling. This does feel like merely a prototype that will be improved and expanded upon by Boon Jong Ho. If anyone who might be reading this who worked on the movie, well done. I mean it.\n",
      "Anyway, just watch it if you have not already. It will be one of the fastest and most interesting 2 hours you will have this year. Watch it without the subtitles first, then watch it with subtitles on. Also try to watch it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos if you get the chance. I currently have not, but I'm sure I'll see it in a theatre somewhere since this still hasn't been officially been theatrically released in the country I live in.\n",
      "Also, I want a Parasite themed rock birthday cake XD\n",
      "One of the best movie I ever watched.This is the first movie of South Korea that I had watch in my life and now I can say that Parasite is better and outstanding movie .This move is far good than Hollywood movies.I rate this movie as No.1 and yes this movie deserves oscar and they did it also.\n",
      "I should say this is Yet another masterpiece . This movie is a combination of Humor with some tragic events .\n",
      "The only thing I agree with the critics on is that it would have been better in black & white. I mean it's a nice film but not an Oscar winner.\n",
      "Derivative and too long. Is today's audience in general so stupid that metaphors must be glaringly obvious? The story has been done so many times, and may I say, better, the acting is uneven and the surreal element has much stronger authors...think Bunuel, for example. The politics rules, once again, with a not so subtle nod towards both Koreas. Quite a good movie, as movies go, but the hype is like its metaphors forced and obvious.\n",
      "The worst movie I have ever seen. The story is very bad and boring. Waste of time. I shocked when I saw that it got high ratings!! Really if I could rate it with (Zero), I will do. The only way that I can understand that its rate is 8.6 that IMDb forgot to put (-) and its real rate is (-8.6).\n",
      "This movie had me speechless.\n",
      "it literally covers all the genres and the message behind is a thing we should all consider once again.\n",
      "the actors, the catchiness, THE SCENARIO. it's an absolute masterpiece.y'all should watch this movie\n",
      "and when you're done, watch it again..\n",
      "I thought snow piercer was a pretty good film when it came out and indeed I still think the same about it. But parasite was outstandingly good.\n",
      "Never too predictable and never too far fetched. Took me a wee while to get used to subtitles as I haven't seen a foreign film for a few years.\n",
      "If only all films were as great as this.\n",
      "Spoiler alert\n",
      "Im glad to hear that a foreign movie has practically won all the prizes on the Oscars and not some American Hollywood films.\n",
      "I liked the movie, but sometimes it was feeling slow. Maybe it was what they wanted to achieve.\n",
      "I like how they show us a genuine family, with actual issues, and some injustices that nowadays happens more than ever.\n",
      "But the thing is...\n",
      "Did they tried to tell us that if you are born in a social class you act like one?\n",
      "Maybe I just did not get the message that the director tried to tell.Also I found the amount of violence was unnecessary and did not seem credible to me.Besides that, I like how they showed actual problems. When the Dad tells his kid this quote: \"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?\"\n",
      "When I first heard of this movie and everyone recommending it I was some what skeptical. When I finally decided to watch it it instantly became one of my favorite movies. The writing, the acting, the directing, the set design. Everything about this movie screams perfection. WE all need to start appreciating SK movies more. I give it a 10/10 because its just that good of a movie.\n",
      "I appreciate the effort of the Parasite team, the director Joon-Ho Bong in particular. He tried hard to get recognized from the international audience by creating a non-typical Korea film. Unfortunately, this is overdoing. The movie is too long and quite boring. Many scenes are unnecessary. Yes, there are times that the movie are fun and entertaining, but to say it is the best film of the year, I don't think it is the case at all. I will be shocked if this movie wins any Oscar award.\n",
      "This is where I get all smug and talk about how I remember when \"The Host\" was released, and in fact I've owned the DVD for well over a decade now. And at that time I wanted to see \"Barking Dogs Never Bite\" as it starred Bae Doo-na, who was popular among me at the time; and I'd heard \"Memories of Murder\" was worth a watch, but my limited attempts never found an available copy - a film that now seems criminally under-promoted in the UK. But after the release of 2009's \"Mother\", as I am neither a Netflix or Jamie Bell subscriber, Joon-ho Bong's name hasn't been in my consciousness a great deal over the last decade.Until about a year ago, when talk was of his latest work being really quite good - tipped, and then fulfilling promise, to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Now South Korean cinema is all popular and that and Oscars are being won - breaking new ground along the way.But, despite my interest in his first two feature length films, I have still yet to see either. \"The Host\" was an entertaining film, but is somewhat clunky in parts; and the dancing on the bus finale from \"Mother\" stayed in my memory, but I had to re-watch it to have my recollection of the rest of the film restored - a tidy little film. But, while good, he was not a director blowing my mind, and after a relatively meagre last decade in terms of the volume of output, I was surprised by both the hype surrounding \"Parasite\" and its ground-breaking achievements. Is it really all that and a bag of Oscars?Well, the premise, is a nice one.The Kims are a poor family living in a basement flat, looking out at the rest of the world from street level. They are more-or-less living in the gutter. Working by pre-folding pizza boxes for a local takeaway, they steal wifi off their neighbours or local businesses - the toilet their wifi hotspot. The son, Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi), has two things going for him: while completing his military service, he learnt English to a good standard; and his friend Min (Seo-joon Park), a suave and sophisticated young gentleman about to travel abroad.While he is away, Min asks Ki-woo if he can take over his role as the wealthy Park family's daughter Da-hye's (Ji-so Jung) English teacher. Ki-woo will be able to pass as an English teacher, and as a failed college applicant, poses little threat to Min's designs on Da-hye. Enlisting his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park) to forge college certificates for him, Ki-woo goes for an interview with Park mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo), exploiting her simple, wealthy naivety.Quickly, Ki-woo learns that the son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung) also needs a new art teacher and recommends his sister for the role, though denies their family connection, of course. Through mischief, Ki-woo and Ki-jung soon get their father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song), recruited as the father Dong-ik's (Sun-kyun Lee) driver and their mother, Ching-sook (Hye-jin Yang), as housemaid. Soon, the Kims occupy the splendidly modern house as much as the Parks, unbeknownst to their hosts.But ousted housemaid Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns when the host family are away, finding the Kims enjoying a night of luxury, unearthing a dark secret kept within the house. Complacently, their cover is blown, and the Kims must do what it takes to keep their real identity, among other things, hidden.As stated, \"The Host\" was an entertaining film, though like any comedy, can have moments where the script feels a little clunky/awkward/Swiss cheese. \"Mother\" was a step up in overall quality, with better storytelling, while maintaining entertainment value. With \"Parasite\", Bong has created a near perfect balance of good storytelling with entertainment value. The first hour is an introduction to each of the nine central characters in what is quite a light comedy drama about con artists.But throughout, Bong leaves subtle references to what will become the film's climax. These start off small, but gradually become more frequent, and when literal push comes to literal shove, the bubbles rise to the surface and boil over. Tension is brought in as we switch to the second half of the film, when the Kims start to enjoy imagining themselves in a life of luxury - another subtle hint, perhaps. Happy-go-lucky tricksters soon become criminals, with Bong pacing this development well.In their showhome advert for the way of life of the mega rich, the Parks are not portrayed as horrible for it. Yeon-kyo is nice, if a little slow, and the Kims recognise this; Dong-ik is complimentary enough; and the two children are normal kids - Da-song deserving of some sympathy. The Kims are more relaxed and likeable, but also manipulative and criminal in their work. Here, the poor appear more immoral.But, as things progress, the Parks begin to show their disgust at those from poorer backgrounds. What start off as seemingly minor comments about how Ki-taek smells, become more frequent references to it, comparing it to the smell of people on the subway, and we all know what that means. Ki-taek is increasingly disturbed by these comments, repeatedly hearing it on a stress-filled night, returning home to his flooded basement apartment. Dong-ik refers to Ki-taek getting close to crossing the line, and returning from his fantasy to his reality, it may be time for that move to be made.Despite exploiting them, the Kims initially liked the Parks; but the more they get to know them, the more they realise the Parks will never truly like them back. The stunning view from the window of the Parks' house is contrasted by the view from the gutter the Kims have from theirs, with Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography telling a story in itself. As the Kims are punished for their crimes, sympathy grows for them, and indeed their whole neighbourhood destroyed by flooding. While they try to rescue their children from the floodwater, the Parks casually watch over Da-song as he sleeps in his teepee in their garden - it won't leak, it was ordered from America.Both families are left scathed by the end, but which do you feel more sympathy for? Who was really exploiting who? Bong weaves these questions in subtly throughout, sucking you in.Now, where's that subsequent \"Early Bong Blu-Ray Boxset\" we all know is about to come?!politic1983.home.blog\n",
      "I dont see it. i dont see why this would be the great film everybody's talking about. the story isnt all that grand, the acting is fine, camerawork is sometimes good but mostly kept simple and the ending is also fine.6/10: good, but not great. imo overhyped\n",
      "Just like with Snowpiercer and Okja when I think back on this movie I am forgetting it faster than I can remember. There are just too many different Genre's happening here to really give anything any sort of devoted attention.Aside from that my, oh my, how predictable. 15 minutes into the movie I knew what the first hour was gonna be about, and I was not wrong. The second act got slightly less predictable but only because it was really trying to not.It could have been much much better had the finale come up with a more interesting solution.\n",
      "There are few words to say about this masterpiece, this is a movie that in my opinion is simply wonderful. The plot is wonderful with continuous twists and variations, the direction is perfect, the shots are one more beautiful than the other so much so that even the smallest action scenes are more than understandable and the soundtrack is beautiful but certainly not memorable, however beautiful. The performances are perfect but unfortunately I have to make a small criticism but not to the film itself, if you have to watch it try to watch it in the original language because the dubbing at least in Italian made me not a little disgusted. Finally I can only say that everyone must see this movie before they die.\n",
      "This film brought me into a different world. Such an intriguing story, like a Molier comedy at the bigining but in the end, the truth is more like a Seneca Horror Theatre.\n",
      "I like it very much.\n",
      "It's a very well-made movie. The third act is tumultuous, trying to mimic a sort of Taratino-esque atmosphere that works partly. I really don't see how this movie won the Oscar when Jordan Peele's \"Us\", a movie with VERY similar themes, but much more well put together, wasn't even nominated. The \"message\" of the film is rather evil and misinterpretable; we're talking about a country that only has the money to make this sort of cinema because economic liberalism built it from the disgrace it was in the past century. The poor family's father's reaction to his boss disliking his smell, in the privacy of his home, is ridiculous.\n",
      "After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres, making it a masterpiece. Being a non-English film winning an Oscar sure explains it. This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes, especially portraying the rage of the lower class.Other than those, the cinematography, lighting, foreshadowing of events, the plot were outstanding. This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad.. Won't give out any spoilers, this is a must watch film for anyone! This will probably go down in history as one of the best movies of all time.\n",
      "This movie is a perfect example of the homeless crisis in Korea. While it does show the differences of the lives of the poor and the rich, it doesn't turn out how you would think. I walked into this movie thinking it would show how greedy rich people are, but boy was I wrong. This is really a unique survival movie, but not the type where a plane crashes or a man falls while cliff climbing. This is a survival movie of how our society can be evil instead of a particular group of people, and how hard it can be for the poor to survive in modern day society in some locations. I am not going to spoil it, but it really changes half way through with genius directing, cinematography, and music.10/10 movie, believe the hype.\n",
      "I was basically rooting for no characters in this film; why would anyone?! There were moments when the family was almost exposed which I guess added some tension but if they got caught, oh well.... Best Picture?, wow.\n",
      "I remember that I put a review on this movie and talked about how great it is compared to Hollywood movies in 2019 year .. But there is a lot people disliked my review.. Now after this movie earned the Oscar how do you feel haters haha.. 7 it's a great rating compared to 2019 year\n",
      "Absolute masterpiece, soundtrack, cinematography simply amazing. The twist of the movie caught me by surprise. Just an amazing experience.\n",
      "When i went to see this film, i was expecting to see if all the reviews saying it being the year's best film were true. Well, i didn't hate this movie, but there was just something about it i didn't like. I don't know what it was, really. The plot was really interesting and well written, the characters were were good, but it was just something about the second act that threw me away. I'm pretty sure everyone else will love it, but i just think it's a bit overrated.\n",
      "It is unclear what the main message of the film is and who should be called \"Parasite.\" As the film constantly makes us feel sorry for the poor family, let us first suppose that the rich family members are considered as parasites, and we should seriously consider the problem of inequality in our society. But no, the dad was hard-working, creating jobs, spending all his available time and money with his family. The man did not abuse his employees, he did not use cheap labor, did not force anybody to work in unhealthy conditions getting huge profit in his pocket. Similarly, the mom was trying to find the best teachers available to get their kids educated, and she treated everybody well. If they had not had servants, probably the dad would have not been able to dedicate as much time to his job and not to forget about his family.On the other hand, the poor family got their positions by cheating. Should they be viewed as parasites then? I don't also think so. They continued to work hard despite all the difficulties they met. They get their job done: the car was clean and driven smoothly, the favorite dishes were cooked, so what's the problem? Who are we supposed to like or dislike, what is the question the filmmakers arise?Also, the movie has some problems with the plot and redundant scenes. It is unclear how a family who lived in a filthy apartment, was not able even to fold boxes became a group of good servants for an upper-class family by doing so naive and straightforward tricks. Why did the director even decide to introduce the scene when they were getting less money because they were not able to fold boxes? What does it add to the film except for the plot holes? He could have just portrayed them as diligent but poor people so that they could have perceived as more positive characters.\n",
      "I have never seen such a movie where every little detail such as dialogue or an object foreshadows other things that come. Absolutely fabulous the way they made this film. It was entertaining and had lots of suspense at the end.\n",
      "Most people will be intrigued as to how this movie won so many awards before they even watch it. Most people won't watch as they can't be bothered with subtitles.\n",
      "It's worth it.\n",
      "A well constructed story of a family scheming to live off another family. It's fun as the story unravels with a comedy yet sinister fashion.\n",
      "Great acting all round with a decent script, remember its subtitled but you get used to that and its not that demanding to read and the acting being that good makes it very easy to follow.\n",
      "Parasite is a refreshingly different and keeps you watching with some twists and turns that make you wonder how its going to end.\n",
      "Its well worth a watch and you'll enjoy.\n",
      "I loved the way you think you have learned alla bout a character, and little by little it changes the message on the film, and it comes from a very dramatic and suspense driven story, to a very gore and impactful finale. Lovely movie.\n",
      "Holy crap. This is a tense movie. You really won't see the twist coming and even then you won't predict what happens. Funny, scary, sad, and yet weirdly sweet. Definitely deserved best picture. Insane.\n",
      "This movie is so good bro honestly don't know how everybody doesn't love it.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the few films that managed to breakout into mainstream US, managing to score itself a well deserved Best Picture at the Oscar's, being the first film entirely in Korean (the first movie to not be English), to do so.Parasite revolves around one single theme: Classism. Not only is the film a stunning visuals masterpiece, but with each minute the movie sets itself up for the incoming climax, one you won't be prepared for, nearly a twist ending that we all had an inkling was coming.Parasite's clear depiction of classism between the working class and the rich is well portrayed and serves as a stellar must-watch. It's metaphors and foreshadowing will leave you questioning everything you already knew about the wealthy.\n",
      "Please stop with all this \"best film ever made\" rubbish. No one can see your profile, you're anonymous, it's pointless.\n",
      "It's not bad. I have no idea how well its acted as I can't speak Korean. And I'm guessing, neither can most here. They could be hammy as heck for all I know.\n",
      "It's quite original, and certainly well scripted. It's also a little far fetched. Well, a lot actually.\n",
      "Listen, it is good. Is it gonna make you rethink \"world cinema\" (ridiculous term)? Not if it was never on your radar.\n",
      "A very enjoyable movie. Very fast paced, very entertaining, very well crafted. Unique and I have never seen a movie quite like parasite.It's been a long time since I haved watched parasite and I am only writing this review a year or so after watching it thus this review is not specific. I'm writing this not to critic parasite but to document my enjoyment of this masterpiece for myself. I will need to watch parasite again and I will. As such, I shall put this review on hold for now. Idkdkdkdkdkdkrjfjjfhfhfbfbfbfnfnfndndnfnfbfbfbfbfbfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfjfjfjffjfjfhfhfhfhfhfhfhhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhffhfh.\n",
      "This is an entertaining movie, but count me among those mystified by the hypr it's generated.\n",
      "1. It presents the Parks more synpathetically than the Kims. I suspect the rich will take more inspiration from this movie than the poor, and \"Parasites\" sure seems like a call to arms by billionaires.\n",
      "2. As someone else pointed out, at the start of the movie the Kims can't even fold pizza boxes, but a few days later they're suddenly geniuses.\n",
      "3. Shouldn't the first chauffeur have turned up in the bomb shelter as the son of the first housekeeper? An opportunity to reinfoce the theme that was carelessly missed by the screenwriters.\n",
      "I am being generous with the 3 stars because films like Charlie's Angels exist, but this has to be one of the biggest disappointment of films I have ever seen based on reviews. This has like a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 95% on Metacritic...are people smoking crack or paid off? This movie is just plain stupid, it's like a teen \"caper\" movie, just ridiculous stupidity being called \"satire\".What annoys me most are these holier than thou critics who are slamming a brilliant, iconic film that is one of the best to come along in 25 years, calling its irresponsible and violent while praising a film about lying, cheating, stealing and actually killing to get ahead in life. Actual children are killed, some bashed in the head, multiple people stabbed, and this is somehow okay because somewhere some darling critic said it was good and the rest of the sheep followed. This film is silly and the message is disgusting. At least some of the folks here at IMDB aren't brainwashed.Yeah, so a film about not being holes to the mentally ill (or anyone) because it hurts, can aggravate their conditions and drive people to suicide or murder is \"bad\" but a film about falsely accusing people to get them fired so you can steal their job, then murder them along with their employers for no reason but greed is \"great\" in whacky CriticLand.Nothing from this film will be remembered next year. Nobody will be talking about it. Nobody will care. Save your money and just watch a teen movie on cable where they are trying to sneak into someone's house and get out before the parents get home. Same level of nonsense.\n",
      "Bong Joon Hoo is at his best! The peach scene is a masterpiece of 21st Century... And the final, god, is epic and godamn sad!\n",
      "Parasite is a perfect film, everything from the acting to the cinematography and writing. By far the best film I've ever seen. If you have not seen Parasite I would highly recommend watching it.\n",
      "At first it was a bit boring, but it got better after the first half. The ending was a bit messed up and the whole movie took a huge turn so sudden.Something that bothers me is how did Ki-woo survived. He was hit in the head with a huge stone multiple times and as we can see in the movie scene, he lost a lot of blood. He wasn't treated as soon as he got hit, because we can see Da-hye caring him on her back and his head wasn't bandaged at all, meaning that he lost even more blood while Da-hye was caring him around. By loosing so much blood and his head was obviously cracked, there is no way he could've survived.But Ki-jung, who was stabbed and still concious through the entire time, died.This doesn t really make sense to me, but besides that, the movie was good. I totally recommend it!*excuse my bad english please*\n",
      "Has nothing special going for it. Sure, it's good at times but there's a lot of thrillers out there that are good at times and most of them don't get a tenth of the praise this movie got.Slow, mildly interesting first act. Thrilling second act. And the third act feels a bit try-hard with and an almost ON YOUR FACE piece of social commentary, and a 25th Hour rip-off of an ending.All in all, it's not a bad film by any account, but it's certainly not as good as everyone's making it to be.\n",
      "I am a little astonished at the high praise this movie has received. The film starts from a good idea for a story, has good actors and beautiful takes. I found it pleasant and amusing up to approximately two thirds of its duration. In the first part of the movie we are confronted with the ability of the \"poor\" to scam the \"rich\" and a comic presentation of the \"rich\" exposing their naivety and manias. The plot seems to change in nature after the servants are lead down to the underground bunker by the former housekeeper. In fact that moment is a turning point into chaos -- of the plot, I mean. My limit of disbelief was then reached. Moreover, none of the interpretations of the movie that I've read about in other reviews (e.g. A metaphor of class struggle, a concern with wild capitalism, climate change, and whatever) seems reasonable or applicable, because they are not compatible with the story and characters' description so far. My interpretation is that, simply, the final sections of the script are uninspired and pointless. I learnt with surprise, the day after having seen the movie, that Parasite won the Oscar for the best film.\n",
      "I watched this movie because of the hype around it, it's extremely overrated, it's a popular story Idea in the Egyptian film industry.\n",
      "This movie is to watch for once, never watch it again even after 10 years, never suggest it to anyone, very normal.\n",
      "When I first saw Parasite, I expected it be a pretty standard Oscar bait movie where nothing much of interest happens. But from it's opening seconds, I knew this would be different. And boy, I didn't know the half of it. Parasite starts one way, and it goes a very, very different direction than you think it would. And while most movies would struggle to balance the drastic turn of events, Parasite manages to expertly keep you guessing whilst still staying grounded in reality. Combine the phenomenal plot with great acting, some laughs, and a shocking ending, Parasite is one of the greatest movies of the 2010s.Final Score: 94/100.\n",
      "It's a masterpiece film.Directed by Bong Joon-ho.At the first of the movie it will charm you.But the more you go ahead the more It's mystery will shock you.The direction of \"Bong Joon-ho\" is very typical.If you once see this movie you can understand what type of Director \"Bong Joon-ho\" is!\n",
      "Shakespearean story. Engaging. Masterfully moving between light and heavy themes and scenes. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Truly exceptional movie. A Must see.\n",
      "I've never been moved by a movie more than this. At times I was shouting at he screen and pulling my hair, practically jumping out of my seat. If you have ever wanted to know how to build tension in a movie in a subversive way, this would be the guide.\n",
      "Don't even get me started on the cinematography, either. From the physical symbolism to the beautiful shots and angles the composition was majestic in a way. Like watching a master hunter track and slaughter it's pray, the viewer, who is completely unaware of what is about to unfold.\n",
      "Not to mention the statement it's making about the class pyramid. The ending illuminates that part of the film perfectly; it feels as though it all comes together then. The story, the statement, the cinematography, and the symbolism. It all creates that beautiful ending that helps the audience truly piece it all together.What a masterpiece\n",
      "I hesitated for a long time before watching. Is it worth watching something not made in the USA, worth it! A very unusual strong film, I guarantee that you will revise it more than once. The connection is very odd.\n",
      "Thrill knows no language. My stomach was in a knot the entire film from start to finish, from the dark comedic beginning to its masterful pivot into horror and suspense at the midpoint. Parasite is a masterpiece and well-deserving of its status as Best Picture.\n",
      "I think the only reason I was mildly disappointed with this film was all the hype, including of course the Oscar win.\n",
      "If I'd stumbled upon this foreign-language (to me) film, I would have been, I'm sure, thoroughly delighted and surprised.\n",
      "But given that it's supposedly THE BEST FILM of all those released in the last 12 months, well, I find myself in unexpected agreement with Joan Collins, an Academy member, who on Britain's morning GMB show said she thought it was a good film; just not The Best Film (although she also admitted to not having watched the last 20 mins, as it got a bit 'dark' - I assume she meant emotionally, not visually - and she was having trouble with the subtitles on her apparently tiny TV screen. Get a 60-inch, Joan, if you're being asked to vote!)\n",
      "It surely does twist and turn, and goes from a light-hearted, almost Ealing comedy vibe, into a slasher in the woods horror flick. The acting is great. The characters, on the whole, believable, but as the closing credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Well, I'm probably in a minority with Joan here, but I guess it was the whole story arc that left me unsatisfied. I would have been more satiated with an ending that allowed the nice, though slightly moralistically-challenged poor 'parasites' to get their rewards, while at the same time allowing the rich, privileged class to see the error of their ways. The rich folk here were, as far as I could see, perfectly nice people, apart from objecting politely to the smell of their poorer employees. Did they deserve all they got? I don't think so.\n",
      "That's perhaps just a reflection of different story-telling techniques around the world. Maybe here in the UK/US we expect Disneyfied Hollywood endings, and this was not one of those. I still can't see quite why the dad/chauffeur decided to stab his employer to death. I can't see how the son of the poorer family survived two enormous blows to his scalp with a sizeable rock, with nothing to show for it than a temporary frontal lobe syndrome that made him laugh and smile uncontrollably, until, for no explained reason, that symptom disappeared when he was looking at news footage of the 'crime scene'.\n",
      "Those details left me feeling uncomfortable, and less than satisfied.\n",
      "Was it just the Hollywood zeitgeist that got this film the Oscar? Let's give it to a foreign language film for the first time, they said. That'll - if not silence our critics, then at least give them something to chew on. That's probably unfair, but, for instance, Rocketman sent me on a far more roller-coaster emotional ride than Parasite did. For me, it was easily a better film.\n",
      "I did like the film, somethingswere not suprisikg but just when you thought that you had the movie figured out it throws something else at you. It had a slow start but the tension really builds up towards the end. Eight concrete houses out of ten!\n",
      "It wouldn't have been a problem if the former caregiver hadn't realized they were family. It was good that morse code worked so well. The host man's insults are frustrating.\n",
      "I believe the director should have kept this movie light hearted and funny despite the serious topic at hand, notably that of inequalities in South Korea. The final 50 min were not all that good in my opinion, and the (violent) behavior of some of the main protagonists defies logic. It's probably deserving of all the accolades because no better movie was released in 2019. I think Shoplifters (2018 palmes d'or) is as deserving if not a better picture than Parasite.\n",
      "...generally interesting if you bookend the acts and scenes.Interesting that it's coming as a series as it seemed more suited for such. As if there was more to see which would make it more compelling. I've had that recently where a \"meh\" or neutral film would make a better series.For instance, the whole process of the poor family getting themselves jobs took up too much time for a movie. Although they're introduced quickly and likeable, I didn't get the full sense if they were just struggling or were grifters. My guess is grifters. But I shouldn't be guessing. Tell me.The second half when the former maid shows up felt very manufactured. Why'd they let her in? The underground bunker was original but how we got there was more trying to write itself out of a corner. Both would have worked in a series, though.The maid turning the tables on them was fine once you were in the underground space, but arriving there was forced. Then the rich family returning was a bit much. Plausible but a bit much.When the maid is kicked down the steps, I thought she was dead from the head wound. So it was odd when the poor husband said \"Thank God\" when he checked if she was breathing after seeing the blood on the back of her head. Conversely, being that she was bleeding but still breathing, he didn't take it seriously enough.The element of the rich father saying the poor father smelled like radishes was a set-up for the ending, but it wasn't enough. When it came, I didn't buy it.The sex scene between the rich couple was awkward and unnecessary.I did see the motivation of the underground man attacking the poor family. But like I said before, I didn't see why the poor father would attack the rich man. And it was obvious where he went afterwards.Not sure why the mother and the son were prosecuted as I didn't see any direct evidence against them. The underground was still unknown to the police. Confused if the rich man died. The father's morse code attempts were very awkward, much less the son seeing them. A big stretch.In the end it was very well made but whatever the message was muddled. Clearly suggested classism but only touched on it at best. I've seen Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer, his segment in Tokyo!, The Host, Memories of Murder and Mother. (Surprised there was so many when I looked him up.) Thought about the same of those: well done but not seeing the hype.\n",
      "I watched this film after the latest Oscar ceremony but I didn't expect a lot from this film. So, I was really surprised. Firstly, the story is really interesting, it seems very simple but you will be a little bit shocked after middle of the film. The plot has some good twisted moments. Secondly, all cast showed the great performance, I believed them. Thirdly, I want to line cameraman's work, the frames looks awesome. I think that some scenes are too long, it's a reason why I didn't rate it more than 8.\n",
      "So, it's wonderful film about our society, family values and, at the end, love.\n",
      "This film is amazing, a little scary but it left me unfazed. There are so many plot twists, and it's incredible filmed. 9.5/10. Loved it, wouldn't watch again just because it's a one-time kind of movie.\n",
      "I always told to myself that, don't judge a movie before you have seen it, even better don't expect anything about it. But this time, at this movie, I can't stop myself from expecting this 2019 Oscar best movie, at least, I hope a wonderful experience just like Memories of Murder.As a result, this is actually a good movie, but didn't good enough for an Oscar, at least didn't good enough for me. The social problem in Korea, the poor and the rich, and 3 families in one house, every design and detail is really amazing. But I think the point wasn't hit enough, seems like just give a try and then run away.\n",
      "Interesting, yet flawed movie. First of all the movie has 0 replay value, which I keep in high regard. Second, no explanation about the obvious masterful bamboozling ability of the Kim family is given other than ms Park is \"gullible\". The movie also has some significant problems regarding its emotional nexus. Everything feels distant and random at best. In addition, even though I liked similar rapid genre swap in Miikes \"Audition\", the trick does not work here that well. Still, a watchable, yet disposable movie.\n",
      "Poverty and prosperity, hope and despair, this is a story that profoundly reflects the bottom of society, absurd but realistic, human beings struggle in despair and look for beauty in hope. A liar family mixed into the upper class for making a living, step by step shocking. Borrowed space, deceived wine were all temporary. The rich surface is glamorous, behind the drug, the children are rebellious and morbid, and the poor put down the patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complex, human nature is difficult to ponder, I hope that fantasy becomes a reality.\n",
      "Emotional Story...\n",
      "Perfect Picture, Screenplay, Editing etc\n",
      "Claimant Of Oscar...Here is a Winner Of \"Best Picture\" Oscar....\n",
      "Thrilling and hauntingly funny. A just winner for the best Oscar! My favourite film of the decade.\n",
      "It was a interesting movie for sure. I would happily watch it again.\n",
      "I wish i knew korean however subtitles isnt so bad.\n",
      "The only reason i saw this movie was because it has won lots of awards and every reporter keeps giving it best score, i agree.\n",
      "After leaving the movie it makes you think. Parasite made history by winning Oscars for best screenplay, best film and best director, independent of the actor. As the first foreign film, it broke new ground in this sense, in addition to winning the Best Film Oscar. Because there is no film in Oscar history whose actors have achieved a hat trick without receiving any awards. While the lower class becomes blind by ignoring their situation by not rebelling against the economic order; from the parasitic settlement and reality around the bourgeoisie; In this movie, he is blind because of the drunkenness brought by the extravagant life. What I told you is only a small part of it. That's exactly why this movie is so important.\n",
      "I'm a little late to the party but this movie is one hell of a fun picture. I didn't see all of the best picture noms but I see why this won. It's funny, suspenseful, scary, gross, touching and more. The storyline is never boring and it keeps you engrossed the entire time. The writing, cinematography, editing, etc is perfect. Twisty and fun is how I would describe this movie. You would be missing out on a great time if you let the fact you need to read subtitles throughout. I didn't even notice. If this movie were made in America and was made the exact same way everyone would be talking about it. Parasite and Get Out! (My favorite 2018 movie) would make a great double feature night.\n",
      "The film was going pretty well and I was enjoying it, but thenSpoiler alert!Why on earth would they allow the previous housekeeper in at that time of night. Surely the sensible thing to do would have been to tell her to come back in the daytime. But no, in order to further the story they had to crowbar this scenario in.From that point on the film was ruined for me.\n",
      "Parasite, a masterclass in storytelling and social commentary, is a cinematic gem that deserves its place among the best. Its strengths are plentiful, from its razor-sharp acting, particularly the standout performances by Song Kang-ho and the ensemble cast, to its impeccable cinematography that seamlessly blends humor and tension. The film's hauntingly captivating score and visually stunning scenes add depth to its narrative. While it may have a few moments that could be perceived as slow, Parasite's brilliance lies in its exploration of class divide and human nature, making it a thought-provoking and utterly compelling cinematic experience that merits its 8/10 rating.\n",
      "It is a ok kind of movie. It is over hyped beyond its worth.\n",
      "I am content with myself that I find I am literally the only person on the planet who hated this movie. I found the acting amateurish at best and the script was so wooden it's amazing they didn't carve the read sheets onto tree trunks.\n",
      "Not gory, not suspenseful, not entertaining, boringly predictable. 2 hours of my life I won't be getting back.\n",
      "This is not just an ordinary movie that you might seeHow there's a difference created by the society on the bases of class-high/low is clearly shown. It has a different story and a meaning to it!\n",
      "One of the finest movie I have seen after a long time. The movie gels with the current world scenario. What a story.\n",
      "This movie is so metaphorical.His is a simple yet unheard-of story! Really nice ! Congratulations to the film director, artists, everyone. We want to see such real stories of class division repeatedly.\n",
      "An unemployed family with rude, unsuccessful parents and over-aged, unsettled children, thanks to a smile of luck and their own not the most honest actions, penetrates into a rich house. Those who want to improve their financial situation, arrogant, determined, grasping and quite capable, Kims do not want to remain in the position of service personnel and begin to try on the role of hosts... But could they have assumed that someone else had \"dug in\" here for a long time, and he would not give up his place at a full refrigerator so easily... The whole story, full of unexpected twists, tragic outcomes and grotesque caricature, seems to me like a tracing paper that can be applied to many socio-economic cataclysms: from labor migration to civil wars and revolutions. An interesting film, outwardly comedic, full of ABSURDITY, but suggestive of associations.\n",
      "Before seeing this movie due to all the hype, I had seen very few foreign films. Not because I never had wanted to, but rather because they are not exactly easy to locate. Naturally since the United States is an English speaking nation, Korean productions and other foreign language productions are not advertised as grandly as say a Quentin Tarantino film. With that being said this review is an advocation for research and stepping out of the confines of ones comfort zone. In the words of the director of this incredible film Bong Joon Ho \"Once you get over the 1- inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\" So let's do as he says... let's take a leap and do something out of our comfort zone. As this film demonstrates in unequivocal terms the leap is certainly worth it!\n",
      "Ok, the korean guys are always seen as the second or third best movie makers in the hollywood and bollywood businness but hold on.I started watching with the idea: why the damn a korean movie earned so many academy oscars, what did the US movie makers have forgotten that this movie stamps it.It doesnt show it clearly at the start but after all the movie scenario been stablished something good is not right.US - Learn from it, please\n",
      "The story is not intriguing. I would not recommend this to my friends and family. overated and didn't deserve oscar at all.\n",
      "I really really enjoyed this movie! There is a good plot, the ending is very good!\n",
      "First half does everything right and keeps you intrigued and laughing simultaneously. The second half and finale of this movie leaves you amazed that someone can botch such a work of art simply by not keeping it simple and consistent and opting for an attempt at a deep shocking firework conclusion. Rookie mistake. By giving this a 10 out of 10 you are simply dropping your standards and succumbing to media bias.\n",
      "I must have seen a totally different movie, because I almost fell asleep in the theatre. And I really wanted to see this movie. It's just a prefect example of how social media and a decently filled marketing purse make you go watch movies you'd otherwise ignore. I really like Korean flicks, but this was whether fish nor flesh.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" rocks an incredibly well-crafted screenplay that smoothly mixes dark comedy, thriller vibes, and social drama. It's like a rollercoaster of plot twists that keeps you glued from start to finish.This movie's all about class differences, digging deep into the gap between the rich and the poor. Bong Joon-ho's storytelling is pure genius, showing a sharp yet compassionate take on this social divide that'll make you think.The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is just drop-dead gorgeous. The movie pays serious attention to every little detail, whether it's the swanky Park mansion or the grimy Kim home. The contrast between these places really drives home the film's message.\n",
      "Parasite from director Bong Joon-ho is a very deep movie on a lot of different levels. There are many symbols and messages throughout Parasite that are harsh but true. The set design and acting work together to create masterful suspense that had me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I can understand why Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture. Don't let the subtitles discourage you from watching Parasite because you won't want to miss this masterpiece.\n",
      "I have very low experience with films with subtitles or are dubbed. This one is my first and will definitely not be my last.The acting is great, the suspense and atmosphere are constant and you never know what is going to happen next.Great film and highly recommend.\n",
      "Typical social commentary movie. Yes its good, and yes it makes you think. Their are lots of details, and I love it when a director does not spoon feed the audience. My main grip is that at the end, the social commentary overrode the movie. IE the movie was always a bit unusual, but the ending was surreal. Not that it was a bad ending, it just felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative...\n",
      "This movie knocked me the heck out , I watched half the movie with my hand on my mouth , couldn't handle the tension in every scene , the cinematography genius or this crazy plot.\n",
      "Fav movie of the year. Consistent and contrasting, heartbreaking and breathtaking, beautiful yet ugly, morality and mentality. Just love every frame of the movie. Stunning. Speechless.\n",
      "Enjoyed this move, smart and with heaps of character. but for me it went downhill in the second half as it went from plausable humour to silly and violent slapstick.\n",
      "Really well scripted. Plot was so suspenseful and executed brilliantly. Props to the editing team too! The director dealt with some worldly issues with great dark humour. Would definitely recommend!\n",
      "The movie had a perfect flow and keeps everyone interested throughout the whole film, however, there were certain things that were not explained or missed some sort of expansion in order to connect all the dots. Additionally, some sort of background into everyone towards the end of the movie would've made it felt more personal I believe.\n",
      "Not a realistic point of view to class differences at all. Seriously? A man lives in the underground of a house for years and no one notices!! like cheap and childish horror movies. Showing rich being nice and poors having deceptive and disgusting maners which is showing lack of respect to this class.\n",
      "Not your run of the mill movie this, twists and turns but its almost always watchable. Recommended.\n",
      "At first I had some reluctance to watch this film, thinking that it is an ordinary Asian film that presents a story from a different corner of the earth than what we are probably used to in Hollywood films or those on our continent. But noticing the rather high rating on IMDB, I said: let's give it a try.The more minutes of viewing went by, the more I was struck by the originality and ideas of the South Korean director. The movie gets funnier along the way, after which extremely strange and funny things happen.I want to say that in my opinion it is an 11 film on a scale from 1 to 10 and that this film beats all the American and European films of the last decade.\n",
      "This film explores the relationships between the haves and the have-nots. The tension that builds towards the end of the film kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting and direction is superb. And the story will have you thinking about the film for days. I highly recommend this as I feel it is one of the best films, not only of the year, but of the decade. I can see why it was nominated and won several awards, including Oscars for best picture and directing.\n",
      "Parasite comes to us in an age where the intersection between art and politics seems to be reaching fever pitch; the moving screen has become a battleground for representation and polemic, and the arguments that stem from the validity of just that become their own dogfights. Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season. The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons. Every man and his dog and his dog's twitter account has a voice, and those tweets may well qualify for Rotten Tomatoes critic status. And at times, the noise surrounding a film can impair our ability to discern its true qualities.Todd Phillips' Joker made the biggest splash throughout 2019, with an array of voices vying for control of the narrative. Some critics derided its dangerous allure to the Arthur Flecks of our time, ticking time bombs waiting to pull their own talk-show stunts, whereas the director himself bemoaned the 'woke culture' that had ruined the comedic genre. While he's not wrong about the disconnect between imagined violence and real crime (in the end, no clowns armed with AR-15s showed up at the premiere), surely Phillips has to realise the slippery slope of interpretation that his film endorses. As a straight-forward character study of Fleck's descent into unhinged derangement, it's sympathetic enough, if not clumsy in its social commentary, mimicking the aesthetic of its Scorsese inspirations from the New Hollywood era in exchange for diluting its contemporary relevance. But as serious critique it's laughable, simplifying society's sickness to a scattershot of seriously specific symptoms. These range from a gang of teenage hooligans hunting clown sign holders (and only clown sign holders) to a pair of cruel Wall Street bankers who coinkidinkily happen to know a full verse and chorus of Send in the Clowns, a song that has zero relevance to the scenario other than its title - that's Glee level, Todd. While Scorsese's camera turned away out of embarrassment for Travis Bickle, Joker revels in its final triumph, consoling its audience's edgiest sympathies. A brief glance at the YouTubers serenading the 167th Street stairs confirms this. It's brand store nihilism, broad enough for anyone to latch onto with their worldly angst.Relatively, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is more consistent in its overall delivery, spinning social parable from the familiar yarn of a classic whodunnit. The moral is solidified in the final frame, where the immigrant carer surveys her new estate (a labyrinthine, Clue-esque mansion) from its top balcony, towering above the former employers who held her family ransom. But although its interactions strike truer (it's gratifying to see the Thrombey clan cajole Marta as 'part of the family', only to sharply change tack when she is granted their entire inheritance, exposing their actual priorities), the story places the othered outsider on such a pedestal that it feels obligatory to side with her. Marta can't even tell a lie without vomiting, wielded by Johnson as a clever plot device, and yet also a characteristic approaching noble savage levels of patronising. The spatial metaphor isn't dissimilar to that of the staircase in Parasite, but you wish that it had a shade more nuance, and that she wasn't just the straight character in a pulpy film where the rest of the ensemble seems ripped out a 21st century version of Clue. In this edition of the board game, Marta wins by playing the moral high ground at every turn. But real life isn't that easy, or that simple.As far as Bong Joon-ho is concerned, politics has always been entwined with the big screen. Because the latter is designed to captivate the popular audience, surely it must be a reflection of their general wants and needs, universal concerns and priorities. Some of his more pointed 'monster movies' take direct aim at the injustices of the world: the ramifications and pitfalls of American exceptionalism in The Host, and the cruel disregard for animal rights by multinational conglomerates in Okja. From his worldview, profit rises above the rest, leaving all behind. But Parasite isn't as straightforwardly didactic, or as easy to summarise. Just when you think you have the film's measure, that the Kims have beaten the system by assuming their mantle on the throne of the Parks, it swerves violently to the left.From the very beginnings of his career, Joon-Ho has been taking genre films and twisting them into social satire, and while the first half of Parasite could operate as a straight thriller on its own, the latter half upends its foundations beyond a merely literal sense. The cast is uniformly excellent, and it is through the Kims that Joon-Ho begins to form his thesis; that class is performative, that being is a constant state of code-switching, and that anyone could find themselves at the bottom of the basement or the top of the stairs, at one point or another in the twisted prism of capitalism. There is an entire wealth of nuance in the formal and informal registers of Korean that will be forever lost to foreign audiences, but their body language and tone tell a whole story of their own; how Ki-woo is seduced by the allure and esteem of a university tutor and in turn seduces Ji-so, feigning aloofness while in awe of her status, or how So-dam's dialogue pokes through upper class formality (while her father fails to bridge this gap), or how Chung-sook swells above the former housekeeper when she talks down to her, scolding the unemployed for not knowing their place. When the new head of house nudges the old aside as if she were nothing more than a pesky mosquito, our laughter is smothered quickly by the crack! of her head against concrete, a testament to both the film's careful drip of dark humour and the lateral cruelty inflicted at the bottom tier of society, driven by a desperate yearning to ascend and escape.Joons-Ho's visual style is a slick, almost insidious thing, willing you subconsciously in the direction of the narrative and to where the power resides within the scene. Consider the opening shot of his debut, Barking Dogs Never Bite, which pulls back from an idyllic forest line to trap the protagonist within the frame, imprisoned in a cage of unemployment and yelping neighbouring dogs. The closing shot pulls the same trick, presenting his success at scoring the coveted title of a university professor, before pulling back to replace the old bars of his apartment with a new set. He has won, but at what cost? Parasite begins literally below ground level, showing you the world as the Kims see it, the veritable vermin of the underground. The camera squeezes in with them hunched around their dining table, the long lens compressing the planes, evoking a feeling of claustrophobia. When Ki-woo makes his initial ascent, the frame expands, dwarfing him in the gated community of the Parks, bathing him in angelic natural light. Only when their gambit is exposed do they scurry back into their murky sewers like rats, flushed out by the same waters that preserve the pristine pastures of their employers. And yet, they commit the same sins, and are guilty of the same transgressions they scorn the Parks for.Parasite finishes with a door slam of an ending, exposing the elusiveness of social mobility as absolute. In truth, I prefer the agony of the close in Burning from compatriot Lee Chang-dong, which achieves the same order of anguish that Joon-ho tapped into with Memories of Murder (its impact somewhat lessened by the recent revelation of the real-life perpetrator). In the end, it is infinite obsession which reigns over the resolution of the plot's puzzle, laced with the poison of class envy; it matters not who Ben really was. Parasite more or less deals with a similar crisis of identity, in which the working class protagonist eventually succumbs to the lure of the nouveau riche and their shiny new world. If you pull back, you'll see that this doubles for the broader anxieties of a country coming to terms with its rapid economic and social growth after civil war. Winning the nation's first, second, third, and fourth Oscar in one fell swoop is a significant boon for Asian representation in the West. And as for working class representation? Perhaps not in the gilded, gated halls of the Academy. Even in fantasy, Ki-woo's triumph barely nudges the status quo. He merely wins by joining them.\n",
      "This is not a professional review. I just have a question. Why are rich people in movies so easy to cheat? For irony?\n",
      "This movie is not so good. Because it is too loud. But it is thrilling until the design collapse. Perhaps one of the causes of I don't like this movie is I don't like Korean movies. Even so I think the house's design is nice.\n",
      "The cinematography of this film is fantastic, but the story is the special ingredient here.\n",
      "Rich people bad. Poor people good. This movie was Marxist trash. Not one character was likable, but the \"protagonists\" were particularly reprehensible in that they lacked character or any sense decency and morality. Inept and unable to fold a simple pizza box, but certain they were entitled to what those who worked harder had achieved. What incensed me was that I was left with the feeling that I was supposed to feel sorry for these creeps? Seriously? I say this as a liberal who happens to believe in capitalism (gasp). I'm giving it 6 stars because of the pace and cinematography, but the message of the film was garbage.\n",
      "I lost interest in this film as soon as the poor, downtrodden family (who I assume the audience is supposed to feel sorry for? I didn't - they were criminals) suddenly became criminal masterminds and were able to outwit the rich, pompous, 'bad guys' (rich family).The plot wasn't remotely believable. In fact, it was laughable (see above).Overall the film was mildly entertaining and certainly 'different' but the plot was entirely predictable, unconvincing, and overly-political.In the end I found myself actually rooting for the rich family. The poor family were bad people. Being poor does not excuse immoral behavior. They demonstrated little to no remorse for their actions and them being poor didn't change my perception of their wrongdoings.They were con-men. They lied, cheated and conned their way into temporary luxury and, in the end, it all predictably backfired. I didn't care for any of the main characters and, whatever political message this film was trying to convey, it's important to remember being wealthy in and of itself doesn't make you a bad person, and being poor doesn't give you a free pass to do bad things.\n",
      "Worth multiple rewatchesLove the multiple reviews on the beatiful cinematography, directing and editting.Should have won more categories at the Oscars\n",
      "Parasite is something special. It seemingly could fit into a multitude of different genres, so there is really no clear answer to what it actually is. I would probably classify it as a thriller myself though. The first hours of the movie does a great job establishing all the characters, making you care for them. The second hour of the movie, is where things go crazy. Never before, have I been more on the edge of my seat watching a movie. The tension is absolutely incredible, my heart must have been going at 150 BPM at one point. Do yourself a favour, and go watch this brilliant movie.\n",
      "The director's control over the story and emotional rendering is as good as ever, the story is multi-nested, the \"underground world\"'s desire for the sun in the courtyard, the discussion of the relationship between money and kindness, and the conversation between the father and son across the letter. Ji Yu planned his future life in the basement of despair and hope.\n",
      "One side is the flooded cabin, the other side is the birthday party.\n",
      "On one side is the cold, hard gymnasium, on the other side is the luxurious, soft back garden.\n",
      "The money was the iron, and it smoothed everything out.\n",
      "They surf the Internet, live in basements, and do whatever it takes to get a job.\n",
      "Just when you think they're bad enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they're not the worst, there's worse.\n",
      "If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you. If you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you.\n",
      "The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into groups.\n",
      "The wall stood immovable despite the wind, sun and rain.\n",
      "Mr And Mrs Park look silly, but they are getting richer.\n",
      "The Kim family is brilliant, but they still can't turn over.\n",
      "You think a good job and a good salary will lift you out of poverty.\n",
      "You can wash the sweat out of your clothes, but you can't wash the smell out of the basement where it has melted into your blood.\n",
      "You've climbed ten floors, twenty floors, and you've probably just arrived in someone else's basement.\n",

      "Great direction.....\n",
      "One of the best you'll see... I'll echo the words of the director ; once you are able to overcome the one inch barrier of subtitles, my god will u enter into a world of some epicness... In this case, a south korean masterclass...\n",
      "It's a film about class struggle in society. At first you get angry at poor characters. They cheat all the time. But after a while, the film makes us accept the truth. It's easy to be good for the rich. The poor don't have much choice.\n",
      "Not sure why I'm leaving a review here as everything that's to be said about the film has been said. So all I'll say is watch it, and be happy that movies like this are still being made.\n",
      "I must have watched a different movie called Parasite\" than the one that won the Oscar. The Parasite that I watched was boring, meaningless, senselessly violent and did not evoke one emotion other than disgust and bewilderment that this movie won Best Picture. There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic. It was a grand gesture for the Academy to award this subtitled, foreign movie, however, receiving an underdog award does not make the movie good. People are easily swayed and like to be part of the \"group\" who like a movie. Like \"drinking the Koolaid\".\n",
      "Good movie. Not my type of movie, but it's good. I only looked at him because he's in a good reputation.\n",
      "This film has deservedly been nominated for awards this season. It is shocking how the director presents the differences between social strata. Shades the characters. There is nothing good or bad in this movie. People are the actors. Mortal, simple ordinary people. The film cannot be classified in a single genre. Sometimes drama or comedy. Towards the end, it taps into a thriller. Displaying rich people is pretty simple. They have no problems. Unlike poorer people. Filming the film is brilliant. The film operates with very strong images. The atmosphere is breathtaking. The movie hangs in front of the screen all the way. The turns are screwed. They ignore the clichés. Simply put, this film has been well-deserved because it raises and answers social questions that are very serious today.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho is an absolute genius and has struck once again with the masterfully twisted Parasite. All four of the central performances are wonderful in depicting this fantasy like film that depicts a family slowly gaining the trust of and infiltrating another, upper class family. Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it. This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising.\n",
      "Hi i was wondering of this movie ofers english subtitles in the theater. I want to see it in Taiwan so bad but i am afraid that it won't have english sub.\n",
      "I love when people get carried away and jump on the bandwagon. Enjoyable? It was ok. Best film of the year? Not a chance. Just because it has subtitles I think some people think they are getting their cultural diversity fix. Its been done better a hundred times over. The comedic element, watch Kung Fu hustle. The serious undertone, watch pretty much anything else. Won't be recommending, wasn't awful, just a bit meh.\n",
      "I watched this film at least 5 times now and I can't get tired of it. I love the way how this film plays with our moral while simultaneously building up this indescribable tension. The Characters are amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and the sets are amazing. I can only recommend this movie.\n",
      "It is ok and I would say watch it but don't understand the whole hype in the media. If at all I would prise the script...\n",
      "The plot is very good, with loads of twists and turns. However, I did not like this movie. It was an entirely unpleasant experience.\n",
      "I've never seen a film build up, so artfully, the desire in its audience to see a rich person get killed just for being rich. So well done. The twists and turns, the comedy, the horror. Flawlessly crafted film.\n",
      "Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult. Breathing the air in the darkroom can only walk like a ghost. Holding the poor stone for life can't get rid of it, and catching the cheap smell can't get rid of it forever. The bedbugs crouching in the ground can be sterilized by medicine windows, and the hosts on the high ground can hire people to sterilize themselves with money. The rich suck the blood of the poor, and the poor live in the rich's house. People and ghosts share food in the same room.\n",
      "Absolutely flawless a simple example of a perfect film\n",
      "The kid was drawing the picture of the the man in the bunker\n",
      "This is a movie that is hard to categorize. It is a category of its own in my opinion. I thought the movie was great, different and unexpected. I don't have the cultural context but still was able to enjoy it. It wasn't the best movie I watched but I am glad I watched it. Dare I say the movie is a masterpiece.\n",
      "As someone who has found themselves watching more foreign films than English speaking ones following the release of squid game, this is the best foreign film I've ever seen. It has everything that you could want in a film. It has comedy, likable characters, brilliant writing, great music, INCREDIBLE set design, heartfelt moments, and even touches on modern issues like socioeconomic status.Most years that I follow the academy awards, I always found myself thinking that the best picture winner is a bit too abstract for my taste (shape of water), but this is absolutely not. It's nuanced without being too direct, and massively entertaining. I expected a boring but insightful watch, and was massively thrown for a loop.If you like foreign films, this is a must watch. Even if you've never seen a foreign film, this is a great place to begin.\n",
      "It is undeniable that this is a master at work. The movie is very well shot, acted & edited. It is undeniable that Bong Joon Ho led the warship masterfully through the abyss of the genre & I do believe that should be pointed out.However, the reason the movie is a 7 & not a 10 is pretty much because the story is simply okay. The movie shines at its best when it goes into the grey areas, talking about rich people being so nice because they are rich & not making the movie about the idiotic correlation between wealth & evil.Yet, it falls short on that regard since this is what this movie ends up being about. Poor people smell bad & rich people will point in out.Simple. Regressive. Wrong.\n",
      "I enjoyed the film and yes the reviews are a little overrated. Regardless it was a fun watch,\n",
      "Plan to read the whole movie, at times the subtitles were a little hard to read because the color would blend in with the color of the scene. I wish I could have dubbed the language over to English.\n",
      "The most deserving best picture movie ever. this film is not only entertaining as a comedy turned horror, it weaves commentary on class divides throughout. peoples reaction to the climax scene definitely tells you a lot about their personal ideology and perceptions of those living in poverty.\n",
      "I didn't think this movie was an amazing masterpiece but I didn't detest it either. it was simply a bit more than okay for me. The story fell a bit flat when I watched it. I enjoyed the tangled web the Kim family wove around the Park family. I almost felt like you were supposed to feel more sadness and empathy for the Kim family. I can't say that I did feel that emotion but I felt I understood why they did the things they did. I enjoyed the story line within quite a bit more than the main. Overall I wasn't blown away but I think it was written, acted and directed extremely well. I'd like to see more from this director. His shots were impressive.\n",
      "I don't have time to write about this sham of a movie. I've already wasted enough time watching it. the movie had no message, no lesson..just bunch of liars and criminals. If the Korean culture is like that then I am definitely steering clear.\n",
      "I have no idea why everyone around me seems to love this movie. What happened to the world?\n",
      "This review contains spoilers.Parasite is a black comedy thriller movie that is directed by Bong Joon-Ho and premiered in 2019. The movie features a poor family that schemes to take advantage of a wealthy upper class family. Along the way, they discover that things are not exactly as they seem.Parasite is a tense thriller with social commentary. This social commentary is present from the first scene where the poor Kim family is making ends meet. They cooperate with one another and scheme to cut corners to gain income quickly. This is the first introduction to the odds that the family are up against. They begin having to cut corners on their side work and bend rules simply to survive. They are pushed by society to undertake these duplicitous actions in order to thrive in society. It makes the audience side understand their plight if they do not want to side with them. Most audience members should be able to identify the plight that the characters are undergoing. The audience can understand from the way the movie is structured that the Kim family were pushed to doing these actions due to their dire straits at home. The social commentary continues when the underground family and wealthy families are introduced.The rich family, the Parks, are unaware of the plight of the poorer classes. This is a situation that they are perfectly content with. The rich upper class family sees the situation with poorer classes as inhuman. This is reflected by both the father and mother having a scent issue with the lower class family. This is brought up multiple times when they pinch their noses to avoid the smell of the lower classes. This is also reflected by the son, Park Da-song, when he realizes the Kim family all smell the same. Much as the rich upper class are oblivious to the plight of the lower classes, they also appropriate cultures and customs. This is reflected by the use of Native American culture diluted into a form that is friendly and non-threatening to the upper class. The upper class is definitely profiting from the labor of the lower classes and it is clearly shown in the movie.The hidden underground class is reflected in the two characters, Gook Moon-gwang and Oh Geun-se. These characters are seen by the Kim family for what they are: opportunistic and desperate. However these two are hidden to the upper class. They took care of the rich while being completely hidden as seen by the \"automatic\" lights on the stairs. This movie makes it clear that the poor class are certainly desperate and uprooting them are dangerous. The Kim family are entirely unaware of the plight that they are in and they do share common cause.The social commentary combined makes for a movie that has an amazingly unique and engaging plot. These moments are the bread and butter to why Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019. This movie has permeance across modern society that is hard to shake. The movie makes for its importance in describing the intricate problematic root causes in why capitalism leads to Parasite's societal dysfunction. These moments showed climbing the ladder was expected, but leads to unintended consequences.The movie in general is gorgeously shot and acted. The movie features direction that is inspired and adds much to the tension. The movie traverses many movie genres and this is impressive in how the movie's direction can stay consistent.I highly recommend \"Parasite\" directed by Bong Joon-Ho.Grade: A.\n",
      "It's not what I expected the ending. But, the nature of humankind to survive, to thrive drive is seen in this movie. But the ending, it was unexpected; it's a pretty surprising ending. This movie could be a good discussion of reality, trust and the need for work.\n",
      "It's a great story about social differences which will leave you amazed by its photographic qualities, the performances by the actors, and the plot!I adore the way this movie is able to tell the story without being so stereotypically in-your-face about who is the bad guy and who is the good one.If you like Lars von Trier and Stanley Kubrick, I think you will love this movie.\n",
      "It's really hilarious most of the time and with some sadness of reality on the class level in the society as well.I've seen a lot of twist-ending mystery movies/shows so the ending isn't that surprising, but it's still a fun movie to watch!Although it's shot nicely, personally I thought 1917 should've won the Oscar over this for best film though\n",
      "Good movie and really entertaining. Wouldn't say worth all the oscars, but it was very funny.\n",
      "From start to finish, Parasite is a malignant joy with a Machiavellian sense of mischief. It demonstrates Bong reveling in his Hitchcockian command of somewhat Buuelian material. The plot is both meticulously realized and uniquely Korean. Export potential are promising, as are remake opportunities. The film's most daring move is to make a picture in which all of the characters are openly unfeeling.Everyone's all-out self-serving nastiness is supported by a scathing view of South Korea's haves and have-nots. A cast in peak character drives itself into increasingly ridiculous and cruel situations.\n",
      "In my opinion Parasite is The Greatest Movie of the Decade. A masterful directing by Bong Joon-ho. Acting, directing, cinematography, production design, score and of course the writing comes together seamlessly.\n",
      "It's won best picture for 2020 along with other awards so seeing all the hype I am really looking forward to seeing this masterpiece.... WOW, was I disappointed. Yes, it's a good film, funny, silly, good acting (not all) etc but \"Best film \" er no ... there are loads of good films equally as good as this but not worthy of the awards it's been given. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but films like 1917 are head and shoulders above this in every way. I know you can't compare the two films in their content but to get best film in my opinion is to tick all the boxes in all categories above the rest, yes??? well Parasite just doesn't do it.\n",
      "I assumed this movie would be good because it won an Oscar but it's just overrated anti-capitalist tripe. Don't bother.\n",
      "In an age of extreme CGI and remakes, Parasite was a treat to watch. The storyline is one of the best I have seen so far. The movie starts of with the viewer thinking it would go one way and then it takes an abrupt turn in the best way possible. I was blown away by the subtle meanings of some of the scenes and dialogues and did not even realize their importance until after a day of finishing the movie. The more time you spend thinking about the screenwriting and direction, the more you start to understand what a masterpiece this is. one hundred percent must watch.\n",
      "Sticks to you and sucks you dry till you drop out in confusion asking what the hell did I see.\n",
      "Got hooked up on the movie since the first minute, the injustice, struggle and social inequality on its best. Great work\n",
      "Director Boon Joon-ho has been slowly becoming my favorite foreign filmmaker outside of North America and the UK. He's extremely talented and a good storyteller. Snowpiercer was a surprise and now comes another pleasant surprise by him in Parasite. Well written story with a talented cast with great chemistry. The flow of the film was smooth and exotic with rich character development, acting was impressive by all. The film's emotional message at the heart of the story, was the real gem and I am grateful for it.\n",
      "Objectively good by most measures, but nothing particularly remarkable about it\n",
      "A good movie in which the plot plays 'second fiddle' to the incredible visuals. The social message is obvious and the story is more like a graphic novel.\n",
      "I can't believe how good Parasite was. All three acts of the movie were so weirdly great. Hilarious throughout and somehow tense, I love both of the family's characters, and the ending was perfect.\n",
      "I only watched this coz of the hype, but it was just an okay movie. I didn't find the story that interesting, especially how they got so greedy. \"Jessica\" quoted some big figures for her pay, I really thought that would have made a difference in their lives, but it seems all the money went to was food, coz thats all that changed in their lives. They started eating at a better place. And it really took a dark turn at the end.\n",
      "The credit of 8 Oscars and praises of all the critics makes you to watch through the movie and hope to finally get stunned by some spectacular element or surprise, but instead the more you go forward with the movie, the more you get disgusted by the superficial and typical story which you one can easily guess the next event which of course you assume that it would be the most stupid thing that can follow! This movie has nothing to offer.\n",
      "Not everyone will understand the subtle ironies and dark humour written into the script. This is a slowly evolving, funny and engaging film for those who have the ability to let the magic unfold without any expectations or needing an explanation for everything. Storyline and characterization are all that's needed for any film to work at a basic level and there is so much originality and depth here to keep the viewer engaged throughout the duration. Many, many contemporary films follow established formulae whereas this one stands alone. For anyone after repetitive, safe, bland, boring and brain-numbing, CGI-laced 'entertainment' I'd recommend trying something other than this work of admirable quality which is well-filmed and acted throughout.\n",
      "This movie will turn out really great for those who focuselly pay attention to every scene, because this movie is very detailed. On the other hand, this will turn out really boring for those who just watch the plot not the mathaphore that has been put together. The main character (the son) has explicitely said the word of methapore at the beginning of the movie, if we take that and put it throughout the movie, this movie will turn out really briliant. I definitely watch this for the second time just to understand every detail.\n",
      "A great movie! With great plot! Great acting from not so popular actors (for us) and everything was entertaining. Unexpected plot twists & great idea! I can recommend this to everyone!\n",
      "I mean from the first shot this movie is breath-taking, I saw about how Bong Joon-Ho storyboarded every scene in the film and it definitely payed off, everything about this film is amazing, the story is genius and as someone who knows nothing about South Korea it's really cool to see someone from that country making a movie telling people what it's like. I don't want to get into spoilers but I will say that the whole thing with the basement is just amazing. I loved this fil and everyone should watch it.\n",
      "Im very surprise by this movie, a masterpiece in his style. The best asian movie of all Time , give it a shot you wont be dissapointed.\n",
      "Very good all up. Loved all the high graphics and soundtrack that went with it. Would see this movie again. Overall very good a solid 10/10\n",
      "So the politically correct award of the year was given to the movie that was a rip-off. Not entirely, but there was so much of Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden in this movie. Just minus the lesbian story and plus the social commentary on rich and the poor.\n",
      "If you put that aside, it's was a really strange movie for me - the first part of the movie was rather dull, but the second was much intense and even quite shocking. The ending was great and made me think about this movie for few days. So - 7/10.\n",
      "I started to watch this movie because it has 8.6 IMDB Rating,I cant believe how this movie get that much high rating,\n",
      "Sorry guys this movie not good for me,very bad storyline,wasted my time,\n",
      "\"Parasites\" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice.\n",
      "The story Rolls a long as you'd expect but then gets out of control quickly.\n",
      "You could see it happening in real life and being one of those weird stories you read in the paper and think \"how does that happen today\". Stays with you. Understand the rave reviews. Not fir everyone.\n",
      "This movie clearly visualize the difference between lower class family and the rich family.\n",
      "*Son...*Channeling Lanthimos, Dogtooth on a cat's jaw -- and panegyric applause to the cinematographer for a job flawlessly done.\n",
      "Parasite was a great movie...one of those movies that you still think about days after you've finished watching it. I loved how it was in Korean - it felt like a glimpse into a different culture. The story especially was chock full of literary devices. The symbolism of the water, starting with the money rock being given to the family as a gift for good fortune, was prevalent throughout the movie. Beginning with a small stream (from a drunkard peeing outside their home) and culminating in the night that changed the Kim family forever (torrential storm that ended up flooding their house).The circular nature of the narrative was also satisfying but haunting. The irony was not lost on me that they discovered the man living in the basement of the Park family, only to have Ki Taek ended up living there himself after he killed Dong Ik. The parallels between the Park and Kim families were only enhanced by how different each family was. Two parents, a boy, and a girl - but from completely different walks of life.I wasn't expecting the story to go where it went...I wouldn't have imagined the slaughter at the end of the movie watching the first 1:30, which made it all the more surprising and meaningful. Parasite was certainly worth of winning best picture, and is a movie you'll think about long after you've watched it.\n",
      "Enjoyable ride through class differences in modern South Korea with an unexpected kick. It's very cleverly constructed and well acted. It's a fun ride and has a hint of Tarantino about it.\n",
      "A movie with much gravitas and profound social issues.We can expect much more from this prodigious director and the stars of this phenomenal movie. Kudos to AMPAS!Hopefully, the Oscar for this film will open the flood gates to more foreign films that have been historically relegated to the \"Foreign Film\" sub-category at the Academy Awards.\n",
      "This movie is overrated. The only reason why it won an Oscar is because the Academy wanted to demonstrate to the world how \"progressive\" they are by (1) supporting a movie about class division and (2) desegregating the award categories so a foreign film could win best picture.\n",
      "The title is a metaphor to describe the relationship between the rich and the poor. It is a social statement. We are first introduced to the poor Kim family who is street smart. They steal wi-fi and put together pizza boxes. Kevin (Woo-sik Choi ) is introduced to the rich gullible Kim family as an English tutor. He manages through lies to get the rest of his family hired on as the old servants are dismissed. We discover poor people have a disgusting smell to them. They smell like the subway (urine?) The film climaxes ar a birthday party.The film was mildly amusing and clever. It wasn't as funny or entertaining as say, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" While good, I would say the Oscar as \"best picture\" was a gift.Guide: F-word. groping. no nudity.\n",
      "The critically acclaimed South Korean film 'Parasite' recently won 4 Oscar awards, namely, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Foreign Film and Best Picture. While fans are in awe of the film, many Twitter users from India are now claiming that the film is inspired by Tamil film 'Minsara Kanna' starring Vijay, directed by KS Ravikumar. The films revolve around a poor family who work at a rich family's place in order to survive. While 'Parasite' did amazingly at the box office, 'Minsara Kanna' which was a 1999 release received average reviews.\n",
      "Film does not have a mouthwatering end or twist to cover up the slow and quite obvious build up. Story line is quite simple and nothing really boastful is out there. There are films made before and will make after this on the same story line.Film is categorized in Comedy category but it does not have any justifiable point to prove it belongs to that category. Comedy is visible only in some here and there scenes and actors/actresses really failed to maximize the comedy factor. Story line and acting both should be responsible for average comedy in the film.Camera Direction seems to be a quite successful area in the film. Director has managed to capture some really nice angles and views to catalyst the current scene. Final scene where camera comes down through a window of snow can be cited as an example.Costumes are pretty good and did not actually disturbed the viewer to immerse mentally into the fictional scenes. The chosen luxury house is also great and it always have that rich cliche in it. Fantastic work by the directors to nail that location.I am 50% alright with the movie but it is average in the sense of story line and acting. Its average guys not poor so jump in and see it for yourselves. It would not be a waste of money for sure. Entertainment wise I m not sure everyone will enjoy it like a 10 star movie.\n",
      "Hello guys and girls!!!!!!!Today I'll talk about this movie, because it's nice, very nice......... no, not nice, it's awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Omg lollll!!!!!! It's like...... I can't predict what's gonna happen!!!!!!!! It's different from everything i ever saw!!!!!!!!!! Watch it, seriously...........\n",
      "this poor family reminds me of a old saying: blacksmith's house, wood stick !!!!!!!!!!!!! My mom always talk it!!!!!!!!Goodbye ladies and gentlemen*-----*\n",
      "Where must I start .. is it a drama ? Horror ? Thriller ? Well let's say it's everything and it is true . The director Mr Bong join-ho has given is everything his direction with spectacular visuals makes it looks artistic, the lightings for each shot and frame is phenomenal also the pace of the movie and how the movie gets into next gear and the twist it's all brilliantly done .. This movie is a satire and the line that society has drawn between rich and poor is well narrated through eyes of both the group .. movie is very metaphorical in different acts and it also adds humor excellently ..\n",
      "Really good movie, the story line of the movie was incredible and it floated piece by piece as well.\n",
      "While Parasite had great cinematography and was gripping from start to finish, the movie lacked proper closure and wasn't executed greatly. The conclusion lacked any relation and was uneventful. This movie which so \"profoundly\" tries to highlight social class differences, failed in creating a movie with a logical ending and turned into a sappy melodrama almost painful to watch.\n",
      "I gave 7 for this movie. I dont like the ending they killed each others. Really bad for reflection, why not they helping each others by buying 1 apartment and live ever after.. But its like a normal live we lived today..\n",
      "Poor and rich\n",

      "If you haven't discovered South Korean cinema yet, Parasite (2019) is a fantastic introduction for the uninitiated. Director Bong Joon-ho has been hard at work over the last 20 years, helping craft films that are thoughtful and horrifying. Movies like The Host (2006) and Snowpiercer (2013) give a sense of his artistic style. Parasite merely takes his ability to shed light on class conflict and molds it into a masterpiece that's half heist-comedy, half horror-drama, and all suspense. If it weren't for the somewhat lackluster ending, I'd give this film the full five stars it deserves.At the base of Parasite is a conflict between the impoverished and the rich. This theme could be easily applied to any country with a wide income disparity, which is probably why it works so well in the United States as well as in South Korea. To survive in these environments, the poor must do their best to polish their image enough so that the rich will hire them. Sometimes, this requires an elaborate series of prepared and practiced cons to break into financial success. Of course, the threat of being uncovered as charlatans is what drives the comedy and suspense of Parasite.My only qualm with Parasite is the uncertainty of its ending. There's a point during the climactic incident where I thought the movie could end, and it would be a perfect kind of ambiguity (mostly because there was a finality to it). Instead, there's a little bit tacked on that covers the \"where are they now?\" which-while being an adequate way to show the cycle of dependency continuing-still doesn't give a wholly satisfying conclusion. Regardless of this, I found Parasite to be a fantastic piece of cinema and one that I believe will stand the test of time like other South Korean films like The Housemaid (1960) and Oldboy (2003) have.A nearly perfect heist/comedy/horror/drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema, I give Parasite 4.5 stars out of 5.\n",
      "If you're poor your place is the bottom. You can fight and win sometimes, but you'll stay at the bottom. Even if you get to be \"up\" for a while, that won't last. And when you make a plan, that plan won't work for long. This film is powerful.\n",
      "\"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\" - Ki-TaekParasite is fantastic.It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act.It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene.\n",
      "This movie show's that you don't need a lot of money to create a good movie just talent needed the best movie of the 2019 absolutely just watch it if my review doesn't convince you mabye 4 oscars awards can\n",
      "I felt the same way as when watcjing Knives Out. Wondering the whole time what's gonna happen next? Never a dull moment. And the story unfolds at a good pace. I felt slightly uncomfortable the whole time. But not too much that I didn't want to finish watching it.\n",
      "I like movies that allow me to watch and allow it to tell me the story as it unfolds. This did that. Great movie.\n",
      "I really like it. It is one of our favorite movies of the year, it is the top 3 !! As a film that received the Golden Palm Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.This is an award-winning movie. But it is one very easy movie Because the film communicates directly from the title Parasite or the chic Thai title \"parasite \", it is clear that the film plays the issue of the differences of \"class\" in society, it is not difficult to understand for anyone who is afraid to It is not fun to watch because the picture is difficult to remember the award movie. You can still watch with peace of mind, because even if we don't care about any issues, you can still enjoy the movie.\n",
      "Movie has good story but hue made for this makes it over rated.\n",
      "Title says its all, starts off as a decent story and just gets totally unexpected.\n",
      "Clever feel-good movie that transcends into Horror / slasher genre - similar to Hitchcock's Psycho.Limitations - Plot problems:\n",
      "1. Kim family members are cunningly talented & smart - yet have the most menial of jobs.\n",
      "2. Papa Kim's motivation to kill Papa Park is implausible.\n",
      "3. Detectives in Korea are apparently useless - can't find Papa Kim.Benefits:\n",
      "1. Suburb film making - pace / rhythm / continuity / acting / montage / symbolism / editing / cinematography\n",
      "2. Consistent Theme of a sons love for his family/father (even a flawed father) and toiling to bring prosperity to his family.\n",
      "It wants to be something that has been done before. That's ok. But it's not the best movie or the year, not even one of the best.\n",
      "Reminds me of other Korean or Asian movies in general. So, simple story, same old cliches, and a crazy, but somehow predictable twist in the second half.\n",
      "Would not watch it a second time.\n",
      "Surprisingly easy to watch. It's a film on many levels starting as a gentle comedy, morphing into something a lot more macabre. Seeks to provide commentary on social class in Korea as well as a nod to the political environment of having a non friendly neighbour in the North. The title is brilliant\n",
      "Wow this is a masterpiece. One of the best films of 2019. Boon crafted such a beautiful world, with writing that seamlessly blends together with every scene.\n",
      "Crazy movie. Really, really original, entertaining, and shocking. I walked out of the theatre very impressed. Easily one of the best films of 2019.\n",
      "Wow! This one really blew me away! The writing is just too good for words to describe. Each and every aspect of film making whether direction , acting , editing , production design, sound design etc. is just best it can get . When you see this movie you will go \" oh this deserves an Oscar\". And you got it right , it actually won the Oscar's. Too many reasons for it to win the Oscar's.\n",
      "The writer and director Bong Joon Ho simply deserves a standing ovation and then in true Korean style, a big bow down with folded hands!\n",
      "Great movie, great screenplay, fantastic twist, I just hoped it was more balanced, sometimes things happen too fast and sometimes to slow\n",
      "I will say this again and again. Trailers ruin movies. I watched this film after staying away from trailers. I have done so since. Suicide squad. Where I realized trailers ruin movies. Do yourself a favor and if any movie you hear about that you wanna see. Just go see it. Don't watch the trailer. This was the actual opposite of what I thought the film was going to be. And it was incredible. Thanks.\n",
      "Looks beautifully shot. But the story is slow and just doesn't progress to anything significant or surprising.\n",
      "In all honesty I'd been putting this off for quite a while. After watching it I can see exactly why it won so many awards. The entire film is a fantastic view of the class divide. The symbolism used throughout is amazing. The comedy is perfectly timed and the tension that is built in certain scenes (spoiler free) is some of the best I've seen.This film has made me visit the back catalogue of Bong Joon-Ho and with the exception of Snowpiecer (2013) I have not been disappointed.Overall, if you are a film fan then you NEED to watch this... and the rest of his films\n",
      "First infiltrant, nice. Second infiltrant: nicely done, good scenario. although predictable. The rest of the starting plot? Well played and filmed, no surprise anymore. Than the scenario does not have clue anymore, and starts to disintegrate in random plotparts. You start to wait for THE END so you can leave the cinema. While the story could have been developed in several interesting ways.... could have been the best film of the year. What starts with an 8 ends less than a 6, thanks to the scenario. Overrated.\n",
      "I know it's unfair to review a movie after watching only 20 minutes. But I can't be the only one who won't watch a film if they can't buy the premise -- even if it's revealed later it wasn't what you thought it was. That the members of the family could be SO sharp as to insert itself brilliantly into a rich household but couldn't figure out how to get out of a dump where it's desperate for free wi-fi makes no sense. One minute they can't fold a pizza box and the next minute they're the best English and art teachers on the planet. None of the characters had any appeal, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. I know, I know...it tuns into this great revealing movie about class, etc. Maybe it's just as well -- I don't like looking at disturbing scenes, which this film apparently has no shortage of.\n",
      "This was intriguing from the start, but I was worried that the different cutural values might prevent my enjoyment. My concern disappeared as the film became more and more bizarre; I was completely caught up.\n",
      "I'm just laughing at some of the one star reviews on here. They actually admit fast forwarding through parts of the movie and then complaining that the movie made no sense or had no direction. Big LOL and that's why you have to be careful of some of the \"reviews\" here. Even some of the 4 and 5 star reviews makes it clear these people did not watch this film or partially watched it with one eye on their Instagram feed or simply don't know what they're talking about. Well, it won Best Picture of the Year at the Oscar's becoming the first foreign film to accomplish that, and well deserved. So much for the few low reviews. This movie is a rare moment in modern cinema considering how bad movies have been in recent years coming out of Hollywood. South Korea may singlehandedly save American cinema by reminding them how to make a spectacular movie. Let me be clear, it's the best movie of the last decade. Period. If you're a serious person and love top tier cinema then this movie is an absolute must.\n",
      "Trust me this movie will gonna surprise you! I watched it with my mother at home.\n",
      "We both surprised a lot. The story is taking shape very well. 2nd oscar coming from me and my mother. Thanks for great work everyone.\n",
      "Loved the story n all casting. Beautiful pictures. Well descrption of social classes and change on human mind\n",
      "Hands down the greatest film of all time. The story, setting, cinematography, and themes all weave together into a perfect film. Start to finish. This film will be watched and talked about for generations to come.\n",
      "Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world. The scenes in the basement were chilling, especially that first one. The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on, swimming in their own filth during that flood scene, and turning against one another ... it was all devastating commentary on the position they're in, and the struggle. The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party. This is a message film that works on both levels, as it's hard to know how it will play out, and while dark, it's entertaining. The ending is brilliant too.\n",
      "Rly bed movie I sleeped when my friends watched it\n",
      "Alright so I see a lot of words like BRILLIANT and PERFECT being thrown around and I have to admit.. going into the movie I had some pretty high expectations. I love the suspense Korean directors/writers are able to portray in their movies and tend to create some pretty memorable and surprising endings.\n",
      "Having said that I watched Parasite with the anticipation that I was in for a wild ride.\n",
      "First half of this movie I was mildly entertained. I thought to myself okay this seems to be more of a comedic approach to a subject that has been explored countless times in movies. I then thought to myself, wait a minute, the main characters are actually kind of evil. And the rich folks, beside the remarks about crossing lines and Mr. Kims funny smell, seem pretty naive yet nice.\n",
      "I wasn't sure who we were suppose to like in this movie as i quickly found myself not really rooting for anyone. I didn't really connect with anyone. I just kept thinking they were smart enough to pull off this scheme but were not smart enough to think ahead at making the best of this opportunity?\n",
      "Instead pride is what seems to ultimately lead to their downfall... They basically lived in a gutter before all this...\n",
      "NOW sure we can talk about how beautifully it was shot and no doubt the acting was excellent but while this was a good movie it was far from being excellent. Its a good movie. Lets all calm down...\n",
      "I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this good.\n",
      "Nothing to see here. No idea how it won the best motion picture.I kept losing focus, it was just not that amazing. I've seen 100s of foreign films, this was far from the best.\n",
      "Sure, its well shot, crafty in its production. I like the original story, but I am not sure if it is as much of a great movie as it is \"meant\" to be. It's a good watch, but I find it to be far fetch in the negligence of some of its characters and relies on stupidity in their favors.\n",
      "The storyline is really different. People don't get to see this type of movie often. The movie is really a lot to take in the storyline is based completely on the name of the movie.\n",
      "Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale.\n",
      "This movie has lots o technical merits from writing to music to cinematography and editing, directing and acting. The story is interesting and weird, but in a good way. It was different and fun, funny, and suspenseful.But the implied suggestion that there was depth inside of the movie was not very accurate since the movie never really identifies exactly who the parasite is in the class dichotomies; common sense would assume it's referring to the poor people living in the basement or that just finagled their way in, but if the movie was really trying to be artistically grey or ambiguous, it didn't do a good job of portraying the wealthy as that bad of people.For example, the only thing the wealthy did wrong was imply minor drug use and make fun of the way the man smelled, and frankly, who doesn't like good hygiene? They weren't overly mean about it. They were paying the man good money and were professional and nice to him. And for the drugs well, there are all kinds of drugs and it's not uncommon for any classes of people not to experiment once in their life if not more. So if the film was trying to suggest rich people are equally abhorrent as the poor people in the movie, it didn't really stand out.No, to extrapolate that kind of conclusion, one would have to step back from the movie and just analyze the title itself, Parasite, and then evaluate, speculate, and rationalize on their own in a way the movie only grazes, yet doesn't facilitate. Since the wealthy family is simple hard working and earned their wealth and all they are trying to do is make their children happy and healthy, there is nothing wrong with that. They earned their money through hard work. The other poor family was mostly lazy. Sure they had some bad luck with the economy, but they weren't seeking work until the son started the whole scheme.To say that both families were Parasites based on what was shown would conclusively be erroneous, as a result. However, since the movie does raise the subject, perhaps not the Parks themselves, but apparently wealthy people can be parasitic; yes, they may earn their wealth despite having a leg up head start in the world with wealthy families themselves, but that doesn't make them perfect or overall good people. They can abuse and exploit poorer people, or in this instance they can feel no empathy for a family like the Kims whose circumstances were originally based on bad luck, or the byproduct of the bad economy. In other words, the film doesn't really portray the concept accurately, but yes, there are wealthy families worse than the Parks who despite their money are also Parasites. Not sure the movie was trying to metaphorically or ambiguously hint at this, but it didn't do a great job of it, although it does raise the subject.It was a good overall movie though nonetheless.8/10\n",
      "This movie was absolutely breathtaking. My emotions were all over, in just a few shots I could go from laughing to crying.Every part about this movie was important, it all added up with very little wasted shots.The violence was kept in neat chunks throughout the movie, it wasn't the only plotpoint.The characters were all likeable, and I was very invested in what was to happen.The camera angles were gorgeous, and they slo-moed at all the right times.The ending especially had me blown away. When the father signalled in morse code I felt hopeful, sad as his son read through his letter, joyful once again about the money and the house, before being plummeted into despair at the ending, no money, no freedom. The movie wasn't predictable, the plot was unique and I was surprised by every point in it. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but I would highly recommend it for all.\n",
      "Here we have a good example of story telling. The characters are presented in a such a way you can't help but feel empathy for their poor conditions. The characters don't really grow however, they aren't shown at any point to have progressed or have learnt anything, meaning they weren't really used to their full empathetic potential. The cinematography is rather beautiful, and keeps the story moving elegantly. But did it deserve the oscar? No. 1917 ticks every single box. It's enthralling, it's unique, the characters develop, and at the end you're left speechless. At the end of this, I didn't feel much. I'm glad it won the oscar, foreign films deserve high praise and are often overlooked, but i'd watch 1917 again and again and still feel as emotional and captivated, is that not what a best picture is supposed to achieve?\n",
      "This one made a stunning impact for sure! It is not overrated. Highly recommended. 😊\n",
      "I had high expectations for this film, sadly I was dissappointed.I enjoyed most of the film, and the characters. I thought the unemployed family was clever...to a point. Unfortunately, they got too comfortable, and too greedy and their arrogance led to their downfall and tragedy for at least three families.I am old enought to know that life isn't fair and not all endings are happy, but I didn't expect the film start and end on such depressing themes.\n",
      "Interesting story line, nothing revolutionary, and very mediocre acting. Not sure how this movie can get so much attention, i suspect someone has pored a lot of money into the marketing.\n",
      "It was great. It wouldn't call it a masterpiece since I'm familiar with his work. The Host was clearly more entertaining to be and it was still imperfect so it'd be unjust to give this more than an 8 since it was great but not perfect and not the most entertaining work of the director.\n",
      "Everything about the movie is great and fun to watch. Plot,acting and whole stuff are unexpectedly good. Gives you chills and laughs at the same time, reminds me of 'Get Out' . 10/10 would recommend.\n",
      "I just finished this movie. This whole movie give an amazing experience. The story is beyond our imagination. The performance of the all cast is just outstanding. It's a must watch for all movie lovers.\n",
      "But all i could think throughout was, \"you mean to tell me they dont have any security cameras in that house?\"\n",
      "A wealthy protective family just lets strangers tutor their kids behind closed doors in bedrooms? Security camera outside and a secure front door camera but nowhere else.\n",
      "Otherwise a fun, intense ride\n",
      "I came to know about this movie after it has won Oscars and immediately decided to watch it. Let's just appreciate the entire cast and the director of course. I didn't read any reviews before watching this movie because i didn't wanted to be spoiled and biased. So i straightaway watched the entire movie today and i can say that now why it is called PARASITE. The title is metaphorically used in this film, just like parasite first acquires the host body and divides into multiple cells and eats the host cells for existence but sometimes immune system of body fights back eventually killing some parasites cell that's what depicted in the movie but in the end it is parasite cell that won. The oral sex was also perfectly setup to show us the uncomfortable and uneasy position Kim was stuck in. The scout reference from starting was also to carry out the ending scene.\n",
      "BTW i am from India so if any of you can suggest me 5 near to best Korean movies compare to this one then reply me.\n",
      "A fascinating story really. It just gets truly absurd towards the end and pretty much ruins what held out great promise.\n",
      "The best movie of the year won the Academy Award for Best Picture and all of us.\n",
      "Masterful direction from Bong,perfect ensemble cast but two hours...\n",
      "The movie is mainly about upper class & working class people & a clash between them...So,we can say that the movie is good but not so good to get 10 out of 10..The story is pretty simple...But the movie can't be movie of the decade or can't get 10 out of 10 because there are also many movie about the same fact...So good but overrated...\n",
      "I'm sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this.\n",
      "First of all, all this opinions are personal and can only be applicable to this especific movie. From now on, I will open my mind how I perceived the movie and how it touched me, not necessarily being a= universal truth. So, read it with open heart.Photography of the movie is brilliant, as well as the story line unfolding.Before jumping into what I think is crucial, I just want to remark some romanticized/false assumptions employed in this movie. Life it is just not like that:\n",
      "1. rich people is happier than the least well-off\n",
      "2. richness comes out of nowhere, so those people can party all the time\n",
      "3. every mechanism is valid to get poorness behind, such as scams or tricksIn the other hand, I wanted to remark some authentic premises:\n",
      "1. Yes, Richness is loneliness\n",
      "2. Yes, too much money destroy relationship between people. Capital is a relationship solvent\n",
      "3. Yes, scarcity does not allow people to reach their potentials\n",
      "4. No, not all poor man is willing to dedicate himself to honest work, and therefore, avoids the burden it brings as challenges\n",
      "5. Yes, people established in life do rely on strange arguments, as long as they converge to the \"goumetization\" of life style\n",
      "6. Yes, all people want to feel special somehow special\n",
      "7. Yes, simplicity is key for happinessSome thoughts on the characters:\n",
      "1. One family represents scarcity, first two levels of Maslow's pyramid: what caught my attention was that despite of being poor, they were not dumb. The boy could have being a genius of design, the girl a successful artist. Instead they deliberately opted for schemes and dishonesty. They laugh virtually all the time, validating each other's mish-mashes. They struggle together and they are happy to share meals together. Poorness in the movies is always romanticized, put in a box where everything is excusable. To me, what defines poorness is not the lack of resources or money, it is thinking the whole life by half. This means, understanding how the world works, what are the underlying rules and how to fit on the scene.2. The other family represents richness, the top layer of Maslow's pyramid. They went beyond the average. Abundance, excess, distance amidst family members, the need to seek everything specially tailor-mad for them (what I call GoT \"gourmetization-of-things\", consumerism. Have you notice how few lines between these characters are there? Compare the number of lines among poor family members vs rich family members. Maybe God lives in what is common, collective. Sometimes I there is a natural, intrinsic trend to attribute to richness what is often there. Let us see why. To provide to the family, the father is almost always away. It is not shown on the movie, although I assure you he has many, many, problems to tackle on a daily basis. Being rich does not happen by accident, it is more like being placed on the top of a pyramid of marbles. As the time goes by, if one is not careful, the marbles start to spread all over the place. It takes a lot of effort to put them organized again. The mother is trying to protect the kids with the weapon she has. Daughter and son seldom touched their parents. There is a hidden cost on the mentioned topics. The cost of absence, which is never depicted in movies.3. The housekeeper it is a symbol of order. She manages to close some family gaps. Always attentive she keep the ball rolling with excellence. Of course, later on the movie, we realize she is also interested on serving because of a personal condition.4. The man on the basement, could be seen as ghost and glory. Ghost because of subconscious issues we might carry in life. Glory because he live with little and even though is respectful to those who brings him subsistence.5. The children, might be seen as the ones suffering the consequences of social contrast. On one side, the overwatch and undercaress. Remember the boy receiving the walkie-talkie? Might be the concrete symbol of father-son distance; on the other side, the being close to their parents, whoa re incapable of showing a constructive trail.Some other core elements on the story line:\n",
      "1. The smell: it is a way to show arrogant and pedant rich might be. One of the reasons why the driver stabs the father of a family2. The special club for VIPs: demonstrates how fragile are the rich family, taking decision on shallow perceptions. Being subject to any kind of narrative3. The houses represent contrast4. The stone: symbolizes superstition, something that will not make dreams come true. Also, when analyzed the scene on which the boy is stoned, it denotes the tragedy of poor, how it can come back to those who bet chips at it. The wrong way5. The booze: a psychological help to make rich life bearable6. The party: more than being the stage of gore violence, it is a stage where one rich family demonstrates its power (id est status, ego, vanity) to other ones7. The knives: the killings with knives give a more personal and physical aspect to the attacks, something the guns cannot emphasize. It was necessary to the characters to drown their own hands on the victims and provoke the blood shedIn conclusion, at a first level of reflection, the parasite is the poor family, \"invading\" the house by applying weapons are sensible to.\n",
      "On a more deep analysis, and I do not even know if the director intended to do so - that is the beauty of any kind of art -, I think the parasite is the alienation, the way people stop seeing other as human beings. This the major common fact orbiting each and every character. It allows the social shock to occur, it allows the contrast to become laughable, it allows greed to flourish, it allows precocious endings and loss of opportunities.\n",
      "Parasite came along just when I thought I'd seen the best 2019 had to offer. The movie progressed elegantly like an amazing musical piece.The depth of the characters and the story kept me glued to my seat hoping the credits wouldn't roll. And when the credits did roll, I stared at the black screen in a moment of contemplation, thinking, this is what cinema should be. Absolutely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. 10/10\n",
      "Congrats To Director To Pick This Story For The Genre ! It Changes My Mind That Cheating Is Not Bad If The Purpose Is Survival ! This Movie Also Shows Slaverysm And Racism In Reality As No People Shows It Directly To Our Face ! Acting Is Excellent ! Cameraman Deserves An Award ! Ending Was The Best ! Plot Twist Also Attratcts The Audience ! This Story Is So Difficult To Be Done In A Fast Screenplay ! But They Convey The Feelings Successfully\n",
      "There is hardly any doubt that with every discovery and innovation we are inching towards a drastic change simultaneously progressing as well as transgressing. Some people like to call this the end of the human race. However, there is a lot of churning and grinding that remains before one finally reaches the highest level of degeneracy or supremacy. To put it succinctly, Parasite is an animated movie with humans as lead characters and in fact, it is a movie with 'animals' as its prime audience. And animals don't 'see' ; their primary sense is instinct and avoiding all sorts of dangers, their major interest. The question that needs to be posed here is not who is blind but to what degree is one blind. Parasite can't be seen. This particular movie poster is interesting as everyone is blindfolded somehow implying that everyone is blind.\n",
      "Subterranean Views\n",
      "On the surface the Park family has a prosperous life; they possess a huge villa along with a driver, housekeeper and tutors. The Teks, on the contrary, stay in a sub-basement infested with pests. Both their dwellings have severed ties with the outside world and provide an incomplete picture - the sub-basement only allows visual access to the lower half of the lane where passer-bys mindless of the fact that corners where they were so shamelessly urinating could be a home to a family whereas through the French windows of the villa, one has an idyllic panoramic view of the pruned garden which in its own way is a slice of manufactured reality as it is guarded by high walls on all sides.\n",
      "Picturesque Panorama\n",
      "The movie does explore the disparity between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' but not simply in a matter-of-fact way; it goes beyond realistic depiction and shows how in this post-modern day and age the dividing lines between these two classes become blurred. What seems as a prosperous household is in fact rife in conflicts.Basti-esque\n",
      "One of the rudimentary manifestations of this can be seen in the rich son, Da Song who is supposed to have internalised the American Indian, the essence of experience that he captured from his previous expedition. This in any case would have been any other nine year alone indulging in make-believe; however, for Mrs.Park this seemed to be erratic behaviour which had to be kept under check. She likes to think of his artworks as 'Basquiat-esque' and justifies his eccentricity as genius. Neither the mother nor the father try to address what could be the root cause of this problem, instead they keep hunting for a tutor. On the other hand, his sister, Da-hye doesn't seem to be a predominant subject of parental concern.\n",
      "Da song as American Indian\n",
      "Ki-jeong and Ki-woo act as foils to the rich siblings as at least superficially they seem to have a better control over their lives, it's the lack of resources wherein they are challenged. In spite of not having completed their studies, they are quite adept to take on the world. Needless, to mention here that Ki-woo invests a lot of faith in his father's plans unlike Ki-jeong about whom the family unanimously concurs that she doesn't belong with them and was meant to be the first deserving candidate to acquire a higher strata.Mrs.Park comes across as a docile homemaker ,the centre of gravity of the household but that partially is shared by the housekeeper as Mr.Park says that his wife had no talent for housework and that she was bad at cleaning and her cooking was awful and he was thankful to have Ms. Mun Kwang who cooked awesome braised ribs and kept the house in order. On being asked by Ki Tek,if he still loved his wife ,Mr Park sneered it off by saying let's call that love.The husband is highly class conscious and and in his interactions with his driver he makes it evident that he doesn't like his workers crossing the line. Unfortunately for him,the smell that Kim Ki-tek's family reeks of, doesn't adhere to the class boundaries that Mr.Park is vehemently determined to keep intact.\n",
      "Subwayers' Stench\n",
      "Kim Ki-Tek, the poor dad, on the contrary, is not class conscious but oblivious of his reality as a result of which he keeps coming up with make-shift plans, plans that lack planning as a cure to the daily problems that his family has to grapple with. To put it very crudely, he is a hopeless romantic who up until the climax retains his calm and composure. Soon, he is at the verge of losing this presumptuous pensive facade post climax when the story takes a riveting turn.\n",
      "Plan is a common thread that runs throughout the movie especially for the working class family that is the only hope that keeps them going on in their lives, However, the nature of these plans are to be questioned as they are short term, based on addressing immediate needs and oblivious of the cries of posterity. Ultimately, the so-called plan boils down to its nascent state and ceases to exist as Kim-ki Tek says that the kind of plan that never fails is to have no plan at all.Therefore, Parasite is an apt title for the movie as it shows how the bourgeois as well as proletariat family exist as parasites, in case of the working class it is quite evident and the complete transformation corporeally too takes place on the night when the Parks' birthday plan to take Da song for camping fails and they have to return home and we see the Tek family hiding under the couch and they have to crawl out sneakily. Also, in the first few scenes when Ki-jeong and Ki-woo are hunting for the wi-fi signal, they sit huddled together in a corner beside the pot is also a visual simulation of pests hiding in a corner. Perhaps the underlying rule of the coexistence of these two classes bourgeoisie and proletariat is that they remain blind and follow their routine day in and day out.\n",
      "Great story and wonderful genre mix-up...well described thin line between rich and poor society in a constant threat above their heads.\n",
      "Do Not Let The Subtitles put you off, after about 20 minutes, perhaps just after the pizza boxes your in, Didn't think I was going to be watching a film that would end up being my 7th favourite ever film, Considering I've watched very few Subtitled films, this has it all, Crime, Comedy. Thriller.South Korean and it's my number 6 film! I won't ever forget those outside stairs :) it really has got it all ergo why I gave it 9 stars. But I'd give it 9.5 if i could as it's my best 9/10 filmI don't think this film would work in many other countries. Song Kang-ho who plays Ki Taek is superb as the main man. I left this 4 years after my family told me to watch it because of subtitles, don't you do the same!\n",
      "I think this is the second time I review a movie. I just had to comment on this, what is happening here? Did everyone really liked this movie??? I have a lot of feelings towards this movie but it's not adoration. This movie is very disturbing and not easy to watch at times but it does drag you inside. I was disappointed from the turn of events. At the beginning you are let to think this is a light and humorous comedy but then it gets darker and violent and you realize that maybe it's best to just stop watching but I didn't listen to my gut feeling. I wish I just stopped at the middle. I don't like these kind of misleading movies. Starts with Interesting, funny, surprising, then turns to Creepy, violent, tragic, sad and intense.?This is my description. Ughhhhh !\n",
      "After the hype train of this film hit critical I avoided this as I didn't want the hype to taint my view of it long enough I forgot about it. I recently watched it and boy oh boy was I disappointed. I think if it weren't for the edgy champagne socialist clique that controls the opinion of the world this movie would have died in obscurity as it rightly deserves. There is nothing good I can say about this. It's everything pretentious and wrong with those who think they are so in touch with what's cool and everyone must obey and see the world as they do.\n",
      "Unique movie for me. It's a bunch of genres in one sorta. I like how a lot of things in the beginning came back around later in the film.\n",
      "This film is not for everyone, as it is a totally unique style of film and story. In my opinion though, it is done to perfection. I love how it is a bit of everything: a horror, thriller, comedy, romance, crime, etc.I honestly think it's best to just go in not knowing what to expect, and you'll be taken on a wild and fun ride.\n",
      "It didn't add much to me except that I learned that Korean rich people are building such shelters in their homes out of fear of North Korea.\n",
      "\"Parasite\", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a riveting film from 2019. It explores the story of the Kim family, a group struggling with poverty, who masterfully deceive the wealthy Park family into employing them.The Kim family, living in a cramped, grimy basement, desperately seeks a better life. They seize an opportunity to work for the Parks by pretending to be skilled professionals. With each member of the family strategically placed in the Parks' household, they weave a web of deception.While the plot revolves around the Kims' cunning schemes, it's the sharp social commentary that gives the film its depth. \"Parasite\" is a mirror held up to society, revealing the striking divide between the haves and the have-nots.The movie, through its well-drawn characters and suspense-filled narrative, keeps viewers engaged and curious about the next twist in the story. However, beneath the surface-level thrill of the plot, \"Parasite\" paints a grim picture of class disparity.As the story unfolds, it veers into unexpected territory, culminating in a shocking finale that underscores the dire consequences of the Kims' deception. This abrupt shift not only adds a layer of tragedy to the narrative but also highlights the underlying societal critique.In summary, \"Parasite\" is more than a thrilling tale of a con-artist family. It's a thought-provoking reflection on societal disparities, cleverly wrapped in an engaging narrative that keeps viewers glued to the screen.\n",
      "Not sure if it's because of coronavirus but I find this movie seriously disturbing. Definitely rank it as dark comedy. Because it is not the hilarious kind. Funny in the 1st part but not that funny in the last bit. Subtle I guess but not that subtle either. Sad was the feeling I got after seeing this movie. Social cast type.\n",
      "The story is not believable at all and also so predictable.\n",
      "The director couldn't work on characters and that is why we don't care about them at all, there is no sympathy.\n",
      "It is a teenage level movie, I laughed throughout the movie but not because it is funny! I was laughing because the story was so naive. However, from the rate he has got so far, I can say he knows people even around world to make such a bad movie but get credits and who knows awards!! So disappointing to see what credits and stars he has got for this kind of movie!!!!There is a lot of holes in this one such as stabbing the rich guy for nothing! Just not treating well! If the director would like us to believe it, he should take much more time on this character.\n",
      "In the first 30 minutes, at most, we can predict even the final. Ok, the director doesn't focus on this, but what else he gave us!\n",
      "My suggestion, do not waste your time on it.\n",
      "Parasite deserves all the praise and awards it has received and more. It is really refreshing to see a truly deserving movie receive this kind of feedback. The director Bong Joon Ho had already revealed himself with his previous works as an extraordinary artist and one of the excellences of South Korea, which is a truly capable market in terms of filmmaking.While I recognise that nothing is perfect, the flaws in this movie are really hard to find. Every element of the movie is well thought out and detailed, and you can see that it was made by someone with great love and respect for this art. Direction, acting, editing, and screenplay are flawless, and the message comes through powerfully and well constructed. I do not think it is excessive to call Parasite one of the masterpieces of the recent years. There is not much to add except how the director has really given us a gift with this gem.\n",
      "Although its a good piece of film making, I have some points to raise... The thing with \"parasite\" is that it puts one random unexpected event after the other, and sometimes it works pretty well, but sometimes it doens't... you reach the end and you wonder why dit it happened this way... maybe I ditn't get something, but this is what I got from the film...\n",
      "I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.9.1/10\n",
      "Wow very interested . I like it very much. I enjoyed it too. Best app I have ever seen. Well contents and features are available here. Really magnificent.\n",
      "There's 0 comedy from start to finish, I don't know why the tag is there.Good job imdb.\n",
      "Korean entertainment content is near to me as I am associated with the culture and the language since 2008.And this movie is undoubtedly the natural and humble display of common society and it's culture against the riches with a twist at the end!Those who haven't seen this movie yet it's a must watch as it will be worth your time.Wo-Shik is currently part of the \"Wooga\" group with Taehyung (BTS) & other few actors. You can watch their vacation in the reality show Scoop (Hotstar).\n",
      "This movie got so much hype that it's always tough when you go into something with sky-high expectations. I wasn't blown away by the film, as I thought the setup was slow to unravel yet too predictable to maintain that leisurely of a pace, but I did think it did an excellent job of maintaining tension and building the dilemmas and conflict to a point that the whole story becomes so twisted and insane that you're watching it wide-eyed. Good psychological thriller.\n",
      "This was simply art, a very well deserved Oscar movie. The plot is amazing, freaking amazing, it catches you off guard every time and every second that passes. One of my favorite movies of all time. A 10/10.\n",
      "It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film, but the palm did find it unworthy. I don't deny it at all, but I do n' t think it's necessary to retell it. I think there are great shortcomings in three aspects :1, the development of the plot is not logical. 2. expression means symbolic meaning is too straightforward, low-level. 3. theme is not deep.First look at the first, generally speaking a story is very strong film for the development of the plot in line with the basic logic is a minimum requirement. Of course, I fully agree that there is a de facto logical sacrifice required for thematic expression and dramatic effects. But the parasite's sacrifice did not achieve the same thematic expression, which is not ok. For example, the placement of four family members into wealthy families, which accounts for almost one-third of the films, was dramatic and smooth. When the first day of the male master's visit when suddenly the spirit of his sister when suddenly put forward, I feel wonderful, feel very clever, because after all received a salary more than the previous tutor, it is normal to double this salary. But then it was arranged a little bit, and it was so smooth. Second, if the smooth entry into the mansion is needed for the development of the plot, then these people can also be qualified for the mansion job seems even more fake. The rich's nannies and drivers are n' t so good, especially nannies, who have been working with former builders for years to get used to the job. And the whole conversation and manner, the slum environment living in the old couple can not be unmasked. Of course, the director did not fail to take this into account, adding Song Kanghao at home rehearsals and the male owner complained about Song Kanghao on the edge of the play. But it is still not enough, and the overall logical rationality is very fragile. Third, the night of the camping scene, drink all know four people in the living room drink wine and even broke over the wine cup can taste it, the hostess did not even notice, even on the sofa hit a shot, all over the glass residue was only a sweep of Kim Kiting a simple treatment, also unaware, this is basically intolerable illogical. There are a lot of such examples, I admit that some are necessary, but in the overall advance, the director did too much to advance. In particular, the final garden battle, frankly speaking, is it necessary, this ending does not feel a little abrupt, this is the director stall spread out there is no way to solve the outcome of the conflict created by the climax of the solution ah. And the end of the garden battle is the same, leaving the people in need, one to stay in the basement to write, the other to receive letters outside. And Song Kanghao also did not know when his son can come to see, so every day to knock on the Morse code, that lights flash all night our German residents do not find someone to repair. Forget it, you can't stop\n",
      "This was one of the worst movies that I've honestly ever seen. I don't understand all the hype. The storyline was so bland and with many loop holes . The characters were not impressive, bunch of predictable trash. Save your time and money, this left a really bad taste in my mouth.\n",
      "I have watched Parasite twice and still have to watch it again to get into how deep and detailed this masterpiece is. This movie got me looking into Korean cinema and what a country of rich story tellers and new styles in film making. Distrust of wealth and authority. What we brutally see is a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper. A family who works for the wealthy family decide to move in as if this home where there own.For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multitonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.\n",
      "Funny, Sad, Dark comedy, Drama, Shocking twist, but definitely, masterpiece. I like that none of them is represented as the pure evil or the pure humanity, It's just about the levels that the society created. The smell of the poor family is the same (because of the house, as the girl said, because of the level they live in) and also the rich family. The end was so iconic.\n",
      "Best actor was Kang-ho Song (the father of the poor family) he gave us A-Class acting. And also the others were so good but that man was something else.\n",
      "The director and the writer Bong Joon Ho made history. They say films are the history of our age and that man created such a great history here.\n",
      "On a mid day cinema with five other people in it, it was a great day when booked that ticket.\n",
      "Parasite was a wonder to behold. The movie contained wonderful cinematography throughout, from glorious, smooth, long shots, to excellent handheld work. The film's superb visual architecture and design conveyed layers of meaning, accentuated by an incredible cast. And ultimately, though what Parasite has to say might not be anything new (class divide and difference isn't exactly a fresh topic), the way through which it conveys that story is absolutely superb. It's not reinventing the wheel, it's just making a really, really, good wheel. And in the end though, what stood out above all, was the sheer attention to detail.\n",
      "A true masterpiece in every area of film-making. Hats-off to the director, writers, the cast and all involved!\n",
      "There is nothing new about the Movie, just a waste of time, watched it because of the ratings and recommendations, turns out its just bummer 😕..... 2 hours of a boring story and build up for somehow a predicted Ending.\n",
      "Cinematic Masterpiece with a mixed genre. A film that will hold you up and never bore you not even for a second. Its storyline, drastic drama which leaps up the story. Its an tecnical masterpiece cause Boon jong ho knows what he is doing and he crafted it well.\n",
      "If you asked is it the movie of the decade?\n",
      "Well, i can't tell it but it will be in the list.\n",
      "Haooy watch.\n",
      "Parasite was just bad movie which got trophy.\n",
      "if it been spilt up to two section the first was cool but the second one was disappointing and annoying\n",
      "the main problem is basically on scenario . one of bad characters was the father because he was not a father in the beginnig of movie he was a little idiot but not a father and at the end of it he was a selfish man killing the rich guy just because of bad smell and not for his girl .\n",
      "overall I can say parasite is a disappointing movie\n",
      "Wonderful foreign movie I've watched this year but doubt I can rewatch cuz of how I cringed for the family the whole time.\n",
      "I saw Korean movie for the first time and it was awesome. Everything in the movie was great from story to direction. If you are a movie lover you should not miss this one.\n",
      "I was lost in words after watching this movie. You really can't describe this movie except for the word \"perfect\". Just go watch it and you'll understand.\n",
      "I can't get over how it ended, everything comes at a cost every decision has its consequence. It's dark realistic thrilling and sometimes funny. This fits to many different genres.\n",
      "PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended.\n",
      "All I kept thinking as I watched this film was it should of been a book first vs a movie. The experience would have been more powerful reading it vs seeing it. Hard to rate it honestly.\n",
      "I watched the film it is heavy insult ...\n",
      "I really think this movie was beautifully written and produced. I loved the actors and the story was exceptional. I love clever writing and the unpredictability of this film is what keeps you engaged enough to read the subitiles. I can tell why this was such a well received movie because it really does make you laugh talks about different political issues and makes you think more about the world. The one reason I take a start off as I get super annoyed whenever I hear people whining and there was a lot of waiting in this movie which made it at sometimes quite intolerable to watch. I would definitely watch it again especially when I am awake so I can read all the subtitles.\n",
      "The Film starts slow and steady, with Nicely captured Visuals, as the film proceeded it Gets intresting at some point there're some unexpected turn arounds and during the climax the film leaves you anxious, one of the finest films that i have watched\n",
      "The mixture of genres is something i really enjoyed in this movie. Super tense - I didn't even ate any popcorn because I was so focused on what's going to happen next.\n",
      "Unbelievable, great movie! Lovin' it!\n",
      "I think, someday another country will remake this movie.\n",
      "This film finally has an action that has never existed before. And that's exactly the best thing about the film. A thriller story between rich and poor that is pretty well written.As such, I personally found the staging to be rather standard. But the end is worth it in my opinion. The film is rather calm, but the end is all the more shocking and blatant. The acting is solid. The poor family is easy to find, even though it embodies evil. The development of family behavior is scary.If you know the core of the story at the end, the film title makes a very good sense.\n",
      "In my opinion, Parasite wasn't the best film of the year. But worth seeing. Mostly because of the story.\n",
      "Okay, so as many have stated before it is funny comedy, but also unpredictable and a suspenseful thriller. I don't like the ending tho, I think father went a bit out of character, I don't buy it that he would have stabbed the rich man, I understand why he did that, but it's not enough for this character to do such drastic moves. I also dislike that son survived, but daughter died, by their wounds, I would've prefered opposite.\n",
      "Well conducted, superb performance, the movie seems to catch the futility of having too much money and still being blind to others not so fortunate.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the movie. Recommended.\n",

Then \"Min Hyuk\"; Ki Woo (older brother of Kim family)'s friend gives a present \"viewing stone\" and an opportunity to Ki Woo to work as an English tutor for the Park family then Ki Woo make a plan that the entire Kim family can infiltrate the Park's home. The plot twisted when the old housekeeper returns to Park's home while they make a camping trip and Kim family takes over this home, only she knew about the basement under the kitchen and she hides his husband in this basement without anyone know. And the breaking point of this movie comes from the anger of the Father of Kim family that makes him kill Mr. Park because Mr. Park is talked about their family as not equality and the smell of people that use subway train; That is the inescapable poverty and the meaning of poor people.\n",
      "You can understand the message of the movie just the bad people got punished at the end but there is symbolism in the movie. It is the story of capitalism and reflects the social inequality problem in the present that makes people struggle from poverty. The ladder that shows in the movie is about social class, the rich family is living above the hill but the poor family living underneath such as the semi-basement house that has a small window for them. The raining screen, Kim family that live underneath flooded with sewer water but Park family just think that the fair weather will come and they can celebrate for their son's birthday.\n",

      "Starring: Kang ho song, Sun Kyun Lee, Yeo Jeong Jo, Woo sik choi, so damn park, Jeong Eun Lee, Hye jin jang, Ji so Jung etcOverall rating 99/100Parasite is based on a poor Korean family who thanks to their son tutoring a family's daughter con there way into a rich family's life but not everything is great as it seems. WOW what a movie, one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen, so many good things to talk about here so let's get started here.First of all, the performances and the Kim family were very interesting. Everyone's performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here. Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out. I also found the Kim family very interesting. I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house, and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated.Next the film-built tension really well and used gore effectively. This film balanced so many tones well, but I think it balanced the tenseness very well. Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters. And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved. They also used gore very effectively as well. It wasn't overused but it didn't need to be, but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way. They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling.Next the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic. Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes, whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch. The set pieces were also fantastic, I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well, the poor house of the Kim's was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like, but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic, it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes.My next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act. Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places, similar to the gore it wasn't overused and I am glad it wasn't as otherwise the film wouldn't of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me. I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected. I didn't know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next, and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible, huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here.My final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today's society. Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness. The films messages about the class conflict in today's society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do. How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent. The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away. But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think.Overall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen, with masterful directing, cinematography, screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system.\n",
      "I don't often watch Korean movies or drama but this movie was FANTASTIC !There are a lot of things that makes my mind blow : starting from finding the WiFi signal! The plan they made as a family to find a living! To survive in this life that don't have any mercy! Every word! Every sentence was covered by gold!I think that Jessica was right when she said we must find a solution that satisfy everyone and her mom agreed too! I think if Jessica gave them the food then probably we would see a very different scenarios instead of going there with a big rock!I like how Kevin planned his life, such an ambitious guy! even if the certificate was fake, He wanted to join that University! He wanted to marry that girl in the future, never lost the hope, trying his best to find his father, planned to save money and buy that house! that's what life is all about!Another aspect realy shocking was\n",
      "That woman opening the window in the car when she was not wearing shoes ... It really bothered me because they were not judging them because of what they did , but because of their appearance .I think there are sooo many things so interesting ... Go and see the movie!!!!That's all!\n",
      "This is one of the best foreign language films I've seen in a very long time. It's funny, sad, dark, clever, edge of your seat stuff. Its filmed & acted beautifully & the story is extremely entertaining. A must watch!\n",
      "Personally prefer 'Burning' but this one offers more dramatic scenes\n",
      "If you are emotionally sensitive or an empath, I suggest you consider whether or not you want to experience the horrific pain (pain & horror) this movie elicits. If you are in recovery from any type of addictive, emotional, physical or psychological condition, be aware that seeing this movie may trigger a relapse. If you are more intellectual than feeling, and/or know how to healthily manage painful feeling, you'll find this an outstanding movie. The acting is superb. The emotional horror is devastating.\n",
      "Good? Yup. Best picture? There wasnt even a parasite. I thought I had a tape worn once. That was scary. This movie wasnt scary. I thought it would be so, not what I had in mind.\n",
      "Let's make this quick. For a korean movie it's an absolute 10/10!! All day baby.Now comparing it to all movies ever made.....it's a 7. And I'll say a very solid 7.I'm glad people are loving on it so the Korean film industry gets more recognition. I think they are doing great things and soon some truly wonder greatness will pop its little head up out of there.\n",
      "I don't get why this movie got so many awards. The acting is not great and it looks a bit dumb. All the near moments they almost get caugt. And then in the end hey found the money after coming from nothing.Someone described it as the best movie he saw in 2019 so that is why I watched it. But I feel like I lost a bit of my life here. But still interesting to see I am in the minority here. Ah well, there goes my hope for humanity lol.\n",
      "What is it with foreign movies! they just seem to be able to pull a new idea out of the bag and deliver it with aplomb and this social commentary of Korea and the world in general is no exception. Different culture, different ideas and way of life perhaps but this movie applies equally to West as it does East and pulls out all the stops to deliver an excellent nights viewing!Very well acted and produced, this just goes to show that there are a shed load of new ideas out there if one is just willing to look for them.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong. Parasite is a great movie. This being said, I believe that Hollywood is saying we'd rather vote for a subtitled foreign film than recognize Netflix as a major player.\n",
      "The Irishman, The Two Popes and Marriage Story are also great films and deserves more recognition.\n",
      "The movie was going in a good phase, suddenly it changed the track in d climax. may be that part could be shown differently. and also climax was too fast. everything was happening like a flash. i didnt like the ending,but the movie is great to watch for its cinematography. its hard to assign a genre for this movie. u can say its social drama-comedy-thriller kinda. and congrtz for winning the oscars.\n",
      "I was so excited to see this movie after all the awards it got and my expectations were high, but it somehow managed to exceed all those expectations. it's simply brilliant and honestly one of the best movies i've ever seen!\n",

      "This movie was a masterpiece. I will always appreciate movies that are unique and brilliantly executed.\n",
      "I found this film overlong. The film starts off well and the first half is light as the poorer family invagle themselves into the richer family. However, at this point the film takes a tonal shift and whilst this is understandable it jars with what has gone before.\n",
      "The film takes an age to end which I found irritating.\n",
      "I couldn't help but be drawn to this movie, after the opening scenes depicting the never ending struggle to find a good wifi signal.\n",
      "The film shone it's true colors though and expressed what to expect, when a man nonchalantly sprayed the streets with disinfectant, as the family watched on. Followed closely by the family sitting around enjoying a beer. I think someone has caught the Corona virius. The family although quite quirky manage to surgically insert themselves into the lives of another. But they're not the only ones. This dark comedy left little to be desired with a well rounded cast. The ending was straight out nightmare. With a touch of the comidic and a flourish of hope.Favorite scene: cigarette on the toilet while the house goes under.Ps. Just be sure to skip the naughty bit at 1hr 28 for the kids.\n",
      "After first half of movie I had my expectations really high, I got some good laughs and thought this would actually be that 8.6 IMDB that I was expecting. But what ever happened during that second half of this movie... I have no idea how this mediocre movie got so many main Oscar nominations. It ain't worth that, plot is nonsense and no matter how much I want, I can't justify it.Movie itself is worth to watch, but there just isn't nothing special here...\n",
      "The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar.\n",
      "Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. I dont consider myself worthy of reviewing a great master like him. Please watch if you can. One word. Wow!\n",
      "I was not expecting that much of this movie. Normally the films nominated for the Oscars are not my favorites, but I saw something different in PARASITE that take me out of the typical Hollywood movie, the script is very original, and the Oscar is well deserved: you don't expect what is next.This movie can be labeled as black comedy, thriller, and drama. Is also an \"out of the box\" movie, not for all tastes, I recommend to the audience to expect little and then you´ll be surprised by the script. Finally, I have to say that I am glad that the quality of movies outside the US has been improving so other countries can enrich the 7th Art.\n",
      "Not only is this my favourite movie of the century, it's one of my favourite movies of all time. What's so great about it? This movie has the best example of an amazing midpoint and conveys a theme and deeper meaning better than any other movie I've seen. The first half of the film was captivating enough, but once it reaches it's midpoint I was glued to my seat and my eyes were glued to the screen; this movie is close to perfect; I'm sure it might have some flaws, however, I can't see them since the are so easy to overlook because of the qualities that it would take me hours to list. Just to name a few; the pacing is fantastic, the characters are interesting, the conflict is original, and it has one of the best montages of recent years. This movie will go down in history and be remembered for years to come as an achievement of cinema, and this is why I strongly suggest you watch it.\n",
      "A true masterpiece, left me feel-after a really long time-that I had watched a wholesome movie with an original theme. I found everything perfect-The cinematography, cast, music, picture, constant twists in plot that stirred up all different kinds of feelings -everything!\n",
      "I definitely recommend to watch even just for the sake of watching something non hollywood style!!\n",
      "I enjoyed it. Fun little movie. Not sure what all the Hype is about, though, not even close to movie of the year. Worth a watch for sure.\n",
      "A predictable plot from the beginning with a ridiculous twist at the end. Possibly the worst movie I have seen in my lifetime. Don't be fooled by its Oscars'. A waste of time and money.\n",
      "If this film was on the BBC (no adverts) one night I would think it was good fun, well acted, slightly satirical and light as a meringue. Therefore I'd give it 8/10 if asked.\n",
      "However, this film has been held aloft like Simba by all concerned within the entertainment industry as the 'thing' you need to love and that makes a rebel without a case like me peg my nose.\n",
      "An impressive film, both in terms of its themes, as well as its direction and atmosphere. Excellent plot, multilevel with a good balance. The only, perhaps a disadvantage, are the interpretations, which had weaknesses in expression.\n",
      "This potently weird dark dramedy was the surprise hit of 2019, and even took the Academy Awards by storm - the first non-English language film to win the best picture wtf?? It starts out like a satirical take on class differences and tensions, and ends up going its own loony way, with a secret bomb shelter playing a key role in the plot.\n",
      "Just a masterpiece of filmmaking.As far as pacing, dialogue, camera work, cinematography, and acting, I thought this movie was absolute perfection. Every scene and the entire film carries intrigue or excitement. Never a dull moment, or even a dull second, throughout. Just astounding; as someone else mentioned, watch this with a minimum of knowledge about the plot.The overall narrative is also exceptional. For me, personally, there were a couple of elements of the plot in which I would have preferred to be different, which is why I give it 9 stars instead of 10. However, that's not a significant negative, just my own preference and it still is an astounding film.\n",
      "Last year we had Shoplifters which gave us a taste of how Japanese capitalism looks like, this year we have Parasite to show what South Korean upper class smugness looks like. Its a well deserved Palme D'or winner and potentially the first Korean film to taste Oscar glory this year.\n",
      "Aside from the film's encapsulating theme of socio-economic disparity, Bong Joon-ho achieves a Hitchcock-like presence that will have you at the edge of your seat. Suspense, comedy, and drama fall short in describing the intersectional and multimodal genre of this on-screen Román a clef. Setting the tone for the 2020's, Parasite is internationally relatable, aesthetically pleasing, and witty - \"we all have a crazy family\" comes to life as more than just a phrase in this two-hour phenomenon of the decade.\n",
      "As for the rich , basic thing dey do is instal CCTVs in their households , found it overrated as it has too many cinematic liberties taken. Tuition teacher or houskeeping of an internation category cant be done overnight even without a proper interview frm the rich. With all respekt for its oscars , Parasite is a good one time watch & not on par with The old boy\n",
      "This movie has it all. From a fascinating and creative storyline to intriguing characterisation, Bong Joon Ho captures the prevalent topics of greed and class based discrimination. Although many were not a fan of the films later half, personally I enjoyed the exciting, new developed dynamic that Ho presents. He entertains the viewer through immensely tense scenes that keep one on their toes - wondering where the plot is travelling. One can truly marvel at this accomplishment, and the vast majority of people will, I think, be perfectly content with the way that it finishes.\n",
      "I did watch with more expectation after knew it got 4 oscars and its tempting trailer...the movie was good even the base story is simple.but the detailing of movie is soo impressive and casting was awesome..\n",
      "I'm An Indian.I Watched It After A Lot Of Recommendation,But It Never Fullfilled My Expectations.The Movie Shows The Division In Between Peoples Such As High Class And Low Class,It Presents In The Way Of A Comedy Drama.I'm Not Satisfied On The Movie Maybe Because Of I'd Watch Lot Of Indian Movies Which Has These Kind Of Story.\n",
      "What and how and why and when that is the questions you gonna ask at the end\n",
      "Loved so much about this film from the story to the cinematography, the performances the direction.\n",
      "A refreshing change from superhero films and over the top CGI studio films.\n",
      "It's funny it's sad it's intense. So switch off the phone, turn on the film and enjoy. You won't regret it.\n",
      "I can't remember watching a film that covers as many genres as 'Parasite' (Gisaengchung) and does it so successfully. This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy/drama and gets darker as it goes along, becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements. Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that.At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement. 'Parasite' is great, highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions.\n",
      "I agree with the Oscars this film is unique and very enticing and evolves you very quick with funny events where this poor family went through to get a job in the same house! At the beginning, I thought about giving a 9 because as many other here think it was out of reality to be hired by same family in a modern world where everyone is checked out before to get into a new job, but in this case I think there could be a probability that this family was more focused on recommendations and this could possibly happen! .\n",
      "Even the end finished kind of violent and unexpected behaviors happened, I still give a big applause to this Director! No wonder has great reviews in here!\n",
      "This is one of the few movies that I have rated 9/10. It is the first and only movie to win the \"Best Picture\" award without having English as the original language. The plot is very well designed and you will experience almost every emotion from happiness to anger whilst watching this movie. The movie as a whole is criticism to the capitalist system which creates a huge gap between rich and poor people. There are two families in the movie that represents the rich and the poor class. There are a variety of references used in the movie as well which caught my attention and made me like the movie even more. Overall unique would be the ideal word to describe this 4 Academy Awards winner movie.\n",
      "This Oscar winning, best picture, film can best be described as a far-fetched dark comedy. An impoverished family living in the slums of Seoul, gradually integrate themselves into a wealthy upscale family, one by one, through a web of lies and deception. They manage to get the help fired, then surreptitiously plan to get themselves hired in their stead. The plan works fine, until complications arise with the fired, longtime former housekeeper/chef showing up to take care of some unfinished business. She discovers their 'plan' and threatens to expose them. All hell breaks loose and this very funny comedy-drama suddenly goes in another unexpected direction.This is entertaining cinema, well acted, directed and written. I would wholeheartedly recommend it.\n",
      "It's worthy of your time. No wonder its director won an Oscar, he did a great job. Also, you won't find a minute to be distracted or bored. One thing remains unsubtle, for me, I didn't get satisfied with the ending.\n",
      "This turned out crippy so fast. Koreans have their way of making movies. As always, very creepy but original - gotta give them that.\n",
      "This Movie Is a copy of a Tamil Movie. And Now Parasite's Director is sued. Don't Watch This movie instead of it Watch The real One. Parasite DO NOT DESERVE OSCAR.\n",
      "After seeing Parasite, I thought the film was perhaps a 7 or 8 out of 10, but having slept on it I've decided it's a 9 or 10. -- And now over a year after I originally watched and reviewed the film (although I've only watched it once) I'd say it's one of my favourite films. --This review will be full of spoilers, I think fewer expectations will improve the viewing experience.The reason my opinion of the film went up overnight is that it gives the audience plenty to think over, I believe it can be interpreted in many different ways. Like any great artwork it is filled with memorable details, I think there is a hidden meaning to the film, but at the same time it is a fun film to watch. You could watch this film at a purely surface level and enjoy the experience, but I believe there is some kind of allegorical aspect to the film. A famous allegory would be Animal Farm, which is about animals taking over a farm, but which is actually about the Russian Revolution and the USSR. There is no such obvious allegory to Parasite but I do believe there is a hidden meaning. The main thing that points to allegory is the strangeness of the story - particularly at the moment of greatest drama, where the father kills his employer virtually unprovoked. Really what we see here as an audience is that the disgust which the wealthy man feels to his employee is more hurtful than the murder and severe wounding of the poor man's children.At the surface level we can see this is a film about class. Very visibly we can see the people living in (or just below) the gutter, contrasted with the splendor of wealth. The film largely tells the story of a poor family taking over, several servants' jobs in the household of a wealthy family. The poor family are able to do so through insider connections and duplicity in a way which entirely conforms to the saying \"it's not what you know it's who you know\". There are few job interviews, just recommendations, and so the people with contacts are rewarded while the people with skills are not aware there is a job vacancy.And how is one to interpret the word parasite? Who is the parasite? Let me state here that in one interpretation of communism the wealthy class i.e. The land owners and shareholders are parasites living off of the wealth of the workers. But in this film the wealthy man appears to be a hard-worker, so presumably he's not the parasite. Is it the poor family who takes over the servant jobs of the house? The poor father certainly reacts angrily to being compared to a cockroach. They are the most obvious candidates. Also the cook's husband who lives in the cellar is a parasite who lives off the scraps of the wealthy family and who also lives off of the work of his wife. Even the ditzy, wealthy wife might be thought a parasite who lives off of her husband. The poor husband, Mr Kim, makes some enigmatic comments to the wealthy husband about the wife and whether he really loves her. The wealthy husband talks of him over-stepping the mark. While playing Indians he does pretty much say to Mr Kim something like, I'm paying you to be here, don't overstep the mark - in other words we are not equals.Visually, this is a good looking film, imaginitive camera angles. As an audience we can feel the moments of panic, the fear of being caught hiding around the house. There are parts of the film I didn't understand but which presumably make sense to Koreans, like the meaning of that ornamental rock.Anyway a great film, highly recommended.\n",
      "Make no mistake, this movie is hugely entertaining. Until it turns macabre without a warning. Minutes to the end, things took a sudden twist for the worst, leaving me to wonder \"what in the world just happened?\"I naturally rooted for the \"parasite\" family. They're shameless and wicked to the bone, and some of their tricks were so hilarious I nearly choked laughing.In this kind of movies, it is expected that the fall is never too far from the rise. I sort of knew that our heroes would run out of luck sooner or later and things would turn sour. Alas throughout the late turmoil, I anticipated some sort of silver lining which, sadly, never came to pass.Call me naive but how, why should a movie this good leave such a bitter taste in your mouth?\n",
      "Parasite was awesome. From the screenwriting to the acting, this was a film. This was a beautiful film. From the twist and turns it makes, to the surprise ending. Parasite had it all. I wish I was able to have seen it sooner but no theaters near me were playing it. But it's ok because I watched it and loved every second of it. The world this movie brings together, between wealthy and poor. This was a beautifully shot film and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I don't want to talk too much about the film because I don't want to spoil it, so please. Go see Parasite, you will not regret it.\n",
      "This was a throughly engrossing film. Certainly something all movie lovers should seek out and see. Funny, Nuanced, Suspenseful, and poignant. It really has something to say and the performances are all just great. This is why we go to the movies\n",
      "Bong Jon Hoo has created a masterpiece; Parasite hits every genre throughout the film from thriller, horror, comedy & mystery just to name a few. You never know what's going to come next & it had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. I recommend watching the B&W version as it gives a different experience. One of my favorite films of all time, can't recommend this film enough; no wonder it's claimed every prize in the industry, throughly deserved!\n",
      "I thought it is a movie talking about a disease ot a parasite which will end the world but i found that they were the parasite 😄\n",
      "A good movie may be I underrated it because i was preparing myself to watch something different\n",
      "For the first time in history, a movie which actually deserved an Oscar, received an Oscar!\n",
      "I do not think this is a grate movie. The owner of the house totally believes the driver, and others too. at the final stage why the driver is stabling the owner? because he doesn't t like the smell of the t- shirt of the driver?\n",
      "stupid story. but end looks realistic.\n",
      "When I saw the raves about this movie, and saw how many Oscar's it won; I was more than intrigued. After viewing Parasite, I can say that it's not a bad movie by any means; I just don't see what everyone else does. I don't see how this movie achieved everything it has. Again I don't think it's a bad movie, but I don't think it is as great and amazing as everyone thinks it is.I understand this is a very unpopular take, I don't want to turn anyone away, but I also don't think anyone should go in with high expectations, because it's possible that they will be disappointed like I was.Like I said, it's not a bad film; but I personally don't think it's a 10/10 either.\n",
      "This movie is pretty much perfection. It makes you go through literally every emotion imaginable. You will fear, you will laugh, you will be happy, you will be devastated, you will be shocked. You never know where the story will take you next. The actors are phenomenal. The scenario is simple, soooo simple, yet so effective. You follow this family struggling to make enough money, but one day, the son is able to get hired by a rich family to teach English to their daughter. I would tell you more, but I really don't want to spoil anything, not the slightest thing, because I want you to enjoy the movie as I did, knowing nothing. Just trust me, it's worth every second.This movie is the one that got me into Korean films and series, and I'm so glad I gave it a shot.\n",
      "I knew nothing about this film until I watched it. Thank god I watch no trailers or even read a description of it. I didn't even know the plot and that made it so much more exciting. Its split into two movies. Exactly halfway the movie a doorbell rings and it changes to the second movie. I was gripped from start to end. Anyone who gave it a 1 star just hasn't seen the movie.\n",
      "Probably one of the greatest movies of all time!\n",
      "I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as \"Jessica\", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her \"uncle\" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a \"ghost\", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!\n",
      "A very different film. Parasite is one of those movies that you'll probably not watch again. Once you've seen it, there is really no need for further viewings. It's not entertaining enough. It has some pretty good twists, but there not like twists in Us, Sixth Sense or Book of Eli where on second viewing things make so much more sense. It's more of a twist like in the first Saw. The movie is also a little slow. The first half is funny though, and it's always very intriguing. Good acting, great cinematography and a good ending. I understand all the hype the movie has and I think it's a good movie, but in my opinion it's not phenomenal.\n",
      "It was a really tight movie, well written. At that phases they barely miss a glimpse of stories. Personally i think there's a really conversation that seems not really needed but the rest was perfect.the scene was good in every aspect that i understand, pay attention to every scene and you may end up surprise with the detail that gave. Tone was really beautiful. scene story portions was easy to understand.my first thought from the poster was it can be really dark, but well you'll see... it will be nice if we got a little picture post event from Ki-woo best-friend to see how he react after all of this.\n",
      "First time i tried to see it was in the cinema, and it didnt take too long for me to leave. In 2022, gave it another shot and said im not giving up this time. I watched it completely. I just dont get all the hype around it. This film deserves a 7 only beacuse of cinematography and maybe acting. But Oscars? Only beacuse its a movie from Asia? Political decision. This movie is OK, but far away from others. This is a 8.5 rating, just like Whiplash, a movie far greater than this one. Maybe it just doesnt fit my taste, but as i am seeing trough this section, i am not the only one with the same opinion.\n",
      "People kept recommending it so finally I pushed through to the end and what a drag it was.\n",
      "It seriously too about 11 tries to finish it.\n",
      "Slow, boring, unlikeable characters, disqusting.\n",
      "It had good photo so 2 stars.Train to Busan is a different genre (or rather it has a genre) and is a much better Korean movie. This was just boring.\n",
      "This was a good movie. However, there are plenty of GREAT movies this year. It's ludicrous to put this movie above all other movies. Joker is my favorite movie of the year, but I didn't expect it to win best picture. 1917 deserves it.\n",
      "That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.\n",
      "Since seeing the early awards it was winning,this has been one of the top 2019 films I've wanted to see on the big screen, but finding it not playing anywhere near me. After it won the Oscars,I checked and found the local Odeon was at last showing it, leading me to finally extracting the parasite.View on the film:Descending in the opening shot to the Kim household, co-writer/(with Jin Won Han) directing auteur Bong Joon Ho reunites with cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and builds a foundation which continues to explore Bong's major recurring theme of class, gliding upwards to the decadent Park household, balanced with long tracking shots down to the dirt-poor ground of the Kim's.Astonishingly building the Park house by scratch, Bong and his regular editor Jinmo Yang work in perfect synch with each other, as Bong's ultra-stylised panning shots over the reflecting surfaces of the Park's house are pinned by Yang's fluid editing slicing off the peel from each level of the Park house the Kim's begin to inhabit.Housing a magnificent ensemble cast, the screenplay by Bong & Han wisely avoid the option of the Park's=bourgeoisie scum,and the Kim's=the angelic poor, instead going for a more thoughtful study of class and capitalism, (major recurring themes of Bong) lit by wonderful con artist thrills, which get baked into a hauntingly bitter final bite.Covering the skyline/screen with the Park house, the writers open the door to the house being at a level of wealth which the Kim's (and others) will never be able to cross the divide to reach, leading to a intense doom-laden scramble to secretly retain control on the lowest level of the house,inside a location where everyone's attempt to keep a firm grip on their cut, leads to them all being parasites.\n",
      "I beleieve that movies from Europe and Asia are special.Take this one for example.Starts slowly and as the time goes the characters are developping we get to know the two famileis.The rich one and the poor one.The end of the film is strange.And the scene with the murder I didn't like.Overall a different film that will maybe capture your heart.Give it a chance.\n",
      "What more is there to say? I never rate movies a 10/10 but this is an 11. It's just amazing, there isn't a single thing about it i didn't love. This is my favorite movie, hands down.\n",
      "Just seen the film. Yes, it is good piece of cinematography. Telling story of different worlds people live in. Separate social bubbles. But what afterthoughts do we have while leaving the cinema?\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer\"? Obvious truths. Nothing new we didn't knew about. Sterile environment of upper class, cockroach life of underprivileged. Dullness of these which have and hopelessness of these which don't. Characters without depth put into roles they were born into.Some symbolism justifying incostinant and improbable plot, but is there enough reason for its application? I see very little.\n",
      "Parasite is undoubtebly an outstanding movie. The plot is clever and jam-packed with twists, the actors do a fabulous work, the concept and the story is ambitious and it is all held together by a crippling atmosphere. It is alltogether thought provoking, it exposes our societys fundamental problems and contradictions.\n",
      "While not arguing Parasites worthiness for all the nominations and prizes it has received (including the four Oscars), I must point out one weakness (I might be amongs the few considering it one), that made me give it only eight stars. In some scenes, I have found the movie just as gullible as Mr. Park and his wife. One example for this the way Kim and his family get out of the house after the owners come home. It is so naive that it would perfectly fit into a Home alone movie. I know that this senselessness is an essential of the movie and is supposed to bring a grotesque balance to it, but it also makes the film quite predictable.\n",
      "But even this predictability is not able to ruin this work of art, and that makes one realize how marvelous Parasite is despite all if its flaws.\n",
      "The resemblance to the famous ramshackle Kettles, to me is hilarious. I'm not sure at all that this is Oscar material but it's quite funny in a cynical sort of way. I certainly would not have rsyedbit better than many of the others in the Oscar list. Personally speaking, I would have given next picture to The Irishman.\n",
      "10 main characters, all paper-thin in their description, none of which appealing. Story is stretched beyond credibility, for a story meant to provide \"social commentary\". But well filmed, and the house looks nice, for sure!\n",
      "An exceptional, very unique in it's approach with no clear out \"bad\" or \" good\" guys. Tackles what it quickly becoming a common theme lately, the class divide, but does so in a clever and disarming manner. Very good and sure to lead to plenty of discussion afterwards. Snowpiercer is still my favorite though, lol.\n",
      "It's way too overrated and weird. Nothing really happens.\n",
      "Superb mix of comedy and tragedy, happiness, sadness, joy and sympathy. Serious theme in a very exciting and refreshing way. Well done.\n",
      "I liked parasite.It was... at least a movie. As someone who watched Parasite.\n",
      "Watch it if you enjoy movies, as it is one.\n",
      "With a run time of two hours, it is longer than any movie over two hours.\n",
      "The characters ran at multiple points throughout the film, it made me think about running; very scary.\n",
      "If you are a fan of morse code, this movie is for you. With some really representation for morse and braille speakers.\n",
      "I rate this movie.As someone who had a parasite, I feel like this does my strife justice.10 Clapping Emoji's out of 10.\n",
      "Enjoyed this film, funny yet scary and thought provoking, would recommend to anyone\n",
      "Kept my interest till the end,pretty good film.\n",
      "Definitely not 1 or 2 stars,but not 9 or 10 either.\n",
      "Very strong artistic performances,amazing directing!\n",
      "Story itself is a bit confusing,changing directions all the time.Nevertheless ,very decent watchable movie,even if just for art qualities.\n",
      "A parasite is a metaphor for a human who uses another human for their personal gains.From that point of view, not only the poor are the parasites of the riches, the riches in some way are the parasites of the poor.My advise: Go blind. Enjoy the ride.\n",
      "Well produced, good entertaining, weird story that stands out of mediocre movies, but is not a masterpiece.Maybe can be different in culture, how korean people show feelings but the mr. kim lacks a lot of emotional depth, they do not sell very well a character full of resentment bursting out and killing his boss, yeah 3 scenes about smell, 2 scenes about crossing the line, and 1 scene talking about chaotic way of living about not creating any plans for the future, is not enough to see the build up of ressentment in the character, lack of expression, lack of close ups, lack of emotional anger, yeah i get it the character is a island, but even if that is true they did not sell well the anger burst, you can see this by how many people that were not convinced about that scene.The kid translate the SOS message and do not talk to any one or do not lead to anywhere, seems like a waste scene, the final about the boy recovering about 2 rock throws in his head feels cheap not constructed, and about dreaming of getting rich and buying the house is a soft ending that feels cheap as well.is not the first movie talking about class struggle, is not the first movie that gets a showdown in the end, is a good movie, is fun, has suspense, has comedy, is surreal, i would still recommend it, but to being a MASTERPIECE still lacks a LOT of depth.\n",
      "If this film has won 4 Oscar awards then it means that the world of the big screen is changing, because it is a nice film but it is not a masterpiece that everyone is showing, films like scarface, last tango in paris, once upon a time the west did not win an oscar and this film won four gentlemen i am shocked\n",
      "This is a very wonderful story.I have a lot of feelings after reading it.\n",
      "The whole process from \"sneaking into\" the rich family to \"parasitizing\" the upper class is full of a lot of cold humor processing and stage scheduling, exuding the charm of black comedy.\n",
      "This really incredible movies, Korean have a great direction for this movies, they deserve for the Oscar winner a really masterpiece.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's Parasite takes on the age-old theme of wealth and poverty and human fate and what a take it is. Artistically powerful and captivating, it throws the viewer into the middle of a very modern and ugly problem: stark wealth inequality and how an individual's life is worth only the size of his wallet. Yet, the film shows how fragile these lives are, whether through the invocation of missiles from neighbouring nuclear power (cornered by imperialism like the husband in the basement - a Frankenstein inadvertently or maybe inevitably created by Mr Park), or other hazards from which even the wealthy have no protection.The film offers a damning critique of capitalism, which benefits the upper classes of the world, and is ultimately tied up with the global hierarchy of power and wealth - a global system that benefits the rich and powerful. The same way as the damned basement-dweller worships the rich Mr Park for what he believes is \"feeding him\", the working class of the world has been led to believe that it is the Jeff Bezos, Jack Mas, and others who are the wealth creators, who feed the talentless 98%. The film is also a direct critique of the colonised mind, which aims at the Korean (and other) society's worship of the capitalist and colonialist West. The obsession with the English language, their replication of the normalisation of the genocide of Native Americans - \"Indians,\" references to studying abroad and the relentless pursuit of mastering the English language as essential social capital is not unique to South Korea or culturally closer Asian countries, notably China. It is virtually every other country that is in Muhammad Iqbal's words \"have been hypnotized by the West,\" yet fail to see, like the members of the Kim family did before taking a closer look, that beyond the façade of extravagance and cash, Mr Park is an impotent man and his wife is a naive woman with no distinction from the rest of the society. There must be something rotten in the system then.The film has sacrifices: the younger daughter dies amidst the drama in the backyard of the bourgeoisie, the poor goes back to the basement. His son gets his Morse-coded message but rescuing him from that place remains a dream. This is a depressing and hopeless take of Parasite on our modern world.The film sells as a black comedy, but I didn't even smile - not once. This is perhaps I was absorbed by the poignant subtext. Secondly, I don't see a solution is offered. But I welcome the open-endedness: we can choose whether it the Parks family who is the parasite, or the global capitalism of the 2%. But, it is the hopeless aspiration of the son, that is to become rich enough to buy the house is built upon the his father's prison, that is the most depressing part? If this is the solution, we are at a deadlock.\n",
      "This is a good film...a one time watch...but, nothing special about it....Just like the other OSCAR Nominated and winner films, the reason behind such a regular film to have such big release, talks and recognition is, it has made fun of Kim jong un and North Korea...just in between the scenes.....this film fall under the category of 'Brag about America or Curse it's enemy'....Again, just a one time watch!!!!\n",
      "Definitely worth the watch. Acting is great and so is the plot. Only complaint is the pacing, the \"big reveal\" about 2/3rds in is a bit odd and feels out of place, especially considering how important it is to the climax of the film. All in all, a must watch.\n",
      "The film keeps the viewer in suspense until the very end. Visually stunning, with the actors' play easy to believe.\n",
      "However the moral side of the message the movie is trying to deliver, if any, is less clear. The plot contrasts two families, poor and rich. We do not know the background of their social status so the viewer cannot judge them based on it.\n",
      "Both families want the best for their relatives, they are kind to them, they both presumably want to work to earn for their families (the rich wife does not need to).\n",
      "This is where the similarities end. The dividing line between the families is not that that one is cunning and the other is mostly naive, not that one is squeamish and the other is untidy. The difference is that the boy from the poor family is ready to kill his competitor hidden in the basement and the father of the poor family does kill his counterpart for what he perceives as a top-down view based on social inequality.\n",
      "Despite such drastically different moral standing, the movie equalizes the families by leaving one member of each family dead. Of course, it does not happen in life that the evil is punished and the good is rewarded. However the movie leaves the feeling that everything is random and pointless.\n",
      "This movie is good but it's a bit overrated. There are more better movies than this to watch\n",
      "'Parasite' illustrates the Kim's persistent inclination to transcend social classes. It is essentially a realistic scrutinization of how the rich and poor are parasitic towards one another, however the beauty of this film is that this idea merely one of the countless interpretations out there. Each scene in this film has been articulated with such thought, while subtle, and the use of cinematography, mis-en-scene, motif and symbolism (to name a few film techniques prevalent) all cohesively work together to portray the social disparity. There is so much yet so little going on...for me, this film was minimalistic but incredibly insightful and meaningful. It is the epitome of perfection.I also love Choi Woo Sik, he is easily one of my favourite actors. This movie, from the actors to the filming is absolutely flawless. If you don't want to watch it because you don't want to read subtitles, well you're missing something incredibly special. Bong-Joon Ho is a genius, alongside the many amazing members of the production team. They all worked together to create such a masterpiece.A good movie leaves you speechless after but a GREAT movie, like Parasite, will keep you invested for months and months and perhaps, for the rest of your life because of how realistic this is.Amazing movie, 10/10\n",
      "Like Rahman's songs, its a movie that lingers on your mind long after you watched it. The lower class struggle and the way they see and feel jealous of the upper class even unknowingly is beautifully presented. Must watch for any human nature observer.\n",
      "For someone like me who barely knows anything about movies and films, this was spectacular to me. In the beginning of the movie, at first I thought it was a little slow-paced because I was under the impression that something big would happen after a couple minutes in as most or some movies usually go. However, it was an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding on who the characters are and their lifestyle, which is something I don't usually pay attention too. The way the movie was created is clever, it builds up the tension throughout it and gives foreshadowing before the climax happens and everything starts going wrong for the family. Meaning that the small conversations they make can have a meaning in what they say or do in future events. And when the climax happened, I was on the edge of my seat and whispering words on what they should or should not have done, showing how invested I was in the movie. At the same time I loved it how smoothly the transition was, as if everything clicked all together. Even though I was frustrated with the characters actions, they were portrayed really well on what's going on in the world and in society. How unfair it could be and how hypocritical we are once all that \"good luck\" begins to get to our heads. One that's well off would say how blessed we all are, while those that are struggling to get by would call it hell and how their lives are simply unmanageable without financial or other kinds of aid. I like how they portray that in the movie, the portrayal of human nature.Not to mention the amount of comedy in this film. I was just laughing at certain parts that I struggled to keep quiet.I would give it a 10/10 but me being stubborn I'm still frustrated about the characters actions despite it being well done 100%All in all, it's a great movie and I'm glad it got the attention it deserves. Props to you all!\n",
      "It seems like a simple story,but really makes me think a lot.Human nature is complex,we can't understand it completely.\n",
      "It's rare for a movie to combine cinematic fireworks and social commentary in the thrilling way that Korean director Bong Joon-ho manages with 'Parasite', a slick home-invasion drama that mirrors the masks worn by its characters: polite until they drop the pretence. The director of 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer' is no stranger to genre gymnastics, and here he tells the story of a poor Seoul family infiltrating the lives of a super-rich household through suspense, drama, laughs and farce, allowing moments of pure terror, quiet observation and baroque noise to sit happily alongside each other. It never jars as it glides from one state of being to the next.\n",
      "The appeal of 'Parasite' is simple and age-old: inequality, class, manners and how we behave to protect what's ours, or to gain that which we believe should be ours.\n",
      "I mean it was pretty good but nothing to get so excited about. The plot is solid and keeps you engaged throughout, maybe dropping off a bit towards the end. The overall acting and cinematography was pretty solid too, it's definitely worth a watch. However if you're going into it expecting some Oscar winning movie experience then you may be disappointed as it is very much overrated.\n",
      "Parasite is a well crafted movie which grips the audience and push them deeper into the plot and shakes them in a manner they couldn't imagine. The movie is both entertaining and deep thinking. The message of the movie is quite well depicted almost every scene. The class difference is wonderfully shown whether by the steep stairs of the society or that of the basement. The best part about the film is that if you want to watch it just for entertainment you have it. If you want to think deep , you have it. If you want to get thrilled, you have it. The screenplay is exceptional as well as the background score. The characters are vibrant and contrasting. The film will leave you emotional despite being a thriller-comedy. If this isn't a masterpiece then there's no masterpiece. This movie is a sure 10/10.\n",
      "This movie have some very unexpected turns. I found it pretty entertaining to watch. Oscar-worthy? Well, not in my opinion. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just that good. I found the dialogue between the characters quite exaggerated a lot of the times. All in all, it is a pretty good movie. But not worthy the extreme praise given from a lot of movie critiques, and not really worth the very high rating given here by the users of IMDB.\n",
      "The storyline is bad and nonsense. They even use a 19 years old girl to do the kissing scene. Wtf ? And nude scene on the sofa out of nowhere. This movie ruined my mood. I expected too much by lookin at high rating.\n",
      "\"Parasites\" uses a family of four to find ways to parasitize the exaggerated acts of rich people, slowly showcasing the opposition and impending crisis of the upper and lower social classes of the Park and Jin families due to wealth. Both films start with joy and end with sorrow, and the starting point for these social events is money.\n",
      "Throughly enjoyable throughout, big anime fan so the subtitles were no issue.\n",
      "I won't get into the details of the movie as I do not want to spoil the fun. The contrast between the wealthy family, the Parks, and the poor one, the Kims is well set. Starting from a seemingly classic story of social class it evolves in a great family drama with a great plot twist.\n",
      "I particularly enjoy the bitter sweet aspect of this story. You are at times rooting for the Kims and at other times for the Parks.\n",
      "I'm glad this movie got the Oscar. It is a refreshing view on society class and its impacts; and a welcome change from the typical, 'always end well\" type of Hollywood movies.\n",
      "It wasn't just a Korean, but a universal masterpiece.A black comedy about class in its best form!Certainly, one of the best movies of the decade!\n",
      "Definitely Oscar-worthy. An experience. the director has done a fab role. Loved the female lead actress.\n",
      "Holy crap this movie surprised me a lot. At first the movie seemed more of the tone of a mild comedy with not much of suspense happening. But then holy shiz nuggets it starts to get more tense and then so much crap happens at once. I can see why this won best picture. I was engaged and no moment was dull. It really sets how unequal classes of the rich and poor are and the truth of it just hits hard when you realize it. Please watch it is a must!\n",
      "I'm not really sure what this movie tried to To tell. Well the movie move very quickly between the scenes and there was some thriller it was not comedic in anyway. I'm still confused as to why the father decided to kill the other father however the ending is quite emotional and shows the in quality of life between the rich and poor and the hard work that comes from trying to be wealthy\n",
      "It is an awesome film that gives the spectator a sneak peek of how the complex Korean society works. The actors are greatly chosen as each one represents perfectly a kind of person (especial recognition to the rich mother, that acts really good). The only thing that I didn't like was the end, it was kinda unexpected and showed that the director wanted to end the movie \"somehow\". I would watch it again.\n",
      "Highly overrated.\n",
      "I was really excited about that film. Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it. Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon, but not more at all. I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two-class-society (that i as a middle class western can not really understand) but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted. Maybe again, its the korean style, but nonetheless it wasnt convincing.\n",
      "Actually i waited for it to end.\n",
      "A deep and profound message ladled with twists, humour and tragedy - A must watch for movie buffs!\n",
      "In over a year I have watched one single film, starting from April I went back to watching the series format, but a film experience is different, especially with one that lasts little more than two hours. I grow a little tired as the story progressed, but I assume it is only because I have not watched the format for a long time. Nonetheless, I did not feel boredom, it was a good start for a return to watching the film format.My second exposure to South Korean cinema, after watching Oldboy, presents a number of elements that direct the story and give the viewer an explanation to accept what is going on and immerse themselves into the narrative that is taking place, these elements don't strike as being obvious but if accepted or ignored the viewer is to be rewarded by being emotionally engaged and producing both laughter and tears as well as experiencing the high suspense than any good thriller is meant to create.It is a professional work, the acting is engaging, the script even if translated seems authentic and the cinematography and the directing are innovative and tasty. One prominent example that makes this film a unique experience is a scene where the mother of the Park family tells the mother of the Kim family, in the kitchen in front of the fridge, about an event in her son's earliest years that involves a ghost, the first mother will go about telling the story and meanwhile the fridge will open slowly, and the view will be focused on the fridge and we will see in front of it a cake with candles that are lit right after a birthday cake was mentioned by the first mother. In this scene, elements from the past and the present were fused triggering a response suitable for a scary ghost story, it was succeeded by a scene representing the event.An obvious theme in this film is the disparities between the classes of society. The Kim family face many daily struggles and they are driven to engage in a ridiculous activity to get paid and that is cutting pizza boxes in a specific shape. Once an opportunity arises, even one that bring morale into question, they seize it, and we can see how the family is happy for coming upon such an opportunity. Once the Kim and Park families were connected, more opportunities presented themselves that were again taken even though the morale stakes were increasing. We witnessed the Kim family plotting to remove people from their jobs only to take them. The end product is different jobs around the Park family where the Kim family pretend to not know each other. This is where the title can be introduced, a Parasite. Many falsified premises were provided to the Park family and many plots were put into action only to receive money, to receive payment for tasks that are actually accomplished. The parasitic behavior is portrayed in how the Kim family assumed control over the Park house when they were away. The film goes into deeper lengths to present what those in fight for survival go through, from living in atrocious conditions to being forced into acting like an Indian highwayman. The poor strip themselves from morality and dignity for survival, and the rich afford to be oblivious.\n",
      "I cant even understand how good this movie is, my mind is too small to truly acknowledge the very masterpiece i have just saw 10 minutes ago.\n",
      "Third rewatch later. Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted. A slow-paced thriller that keeps you on edge, whilst never quite becoming sinister, just powerfully developing the characters' stories to the ultimate conclusion. Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface.Mitchell Bulfin\n",
      "The incredible story orchestrated throughout this film was breathtaking. The shifts in tone done just so so perfectly. The portrayal of the upper and lower class divides are so cleverly done, any doubt i had about this movie before watching it about it's quality then i can't remember them. The only reason it isn't 10/10 is that it's not the cat in the hat by doctor suess.\n",
      "Great movie from a great director. After whatching the movie; it is highly recommended to read about different symbols and things used in the movie so that it can be understood better.\n",
      "Somehow never understood what does the panel find while they give there judgment. This movie was ok but seriously why an oscar, did not get that part. I read people giving reviews about the genre this film has, there are lots of movies which has many genres and much better than this movie.\n",
      "This movie is one of the most overrated/overhyped of all time. \"Deep clever multi-layered metaphors and nuances\"? Sure, like a pretentious piece of modern art. Guess social commentary plus neat cinematography appeals like a valley girl that reads comic books.\n",
      "Good movie with show you how to take advantage from another family. And how easy can be to replace people with easy tricks. I really like the idea. Everyone shows different types of people and way how to show themselves.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie. I have been wanting to watch it for a while. Great acting. A unique storyline. Not bad at all. A lot of entertainment. The beginning was a little slow, but then it escalates.\n",
      "I had heard so many things about this film that I was afraid to watch it. People were extreme about it and I wasn't sure I wanted to have that kind of experience. I'm not into over-the-top stuff.At any rate, it so happened that I rented the film and because I live in Japan and have a Japanese husband, I knew we'd be watching it with Japanese subtitles. So, I read the script in advance -- and I have to say, the script was brilliant. It was a page turner. It was, in fact, I think, better than the actual film.Nonetheless... the movie was a unique experience and I had never seen anything like it. It starts a bit slow and you think, \"Okay... and...?\" But it quickly gains steam and starts running. That said, there were still moments where I thought, \"Get on with it!\" Especially the scene of the \"parasite\" family eating and drinking in the \"rich\" family's home, as if it it belonged to them. That went on and on and on.Also, the entire story hinges on two events; one is believable, the other is questionable. The first one is when a friend of the parasite family's college-age son tells him to take over as English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, because he's got a job (or something) and he will come back and marry the daughter in two years (or something). This didn't really make any sense, because if he really wanted to marry the daughter, he could have already put things in motion. Instead, he passes this job off to his friend. Granted the \"parasite\" son was extremely handsome and soon the daughter falls in love with him. The \"parasite\" son is very, very clever, and through him, he manages to get the rest of his family (his sister, his mom and dad) all jobs working for the rich family. It's best to watch the movie to see how this unfolds.That said, the rich family seemed awfully gullible, but on the other, it is conceivable that the things that happened could actually have happened.Basically, this is a black comedy and there are hysterically funny moments. But there are also shocking moments and mid-way through a huge plot turn that dictates how the rest of the movie plays out.All actors were uniformly good (the \"rich\" family's young son was not given much to do, so his acting ability can't really be judged), but to me, the best person in the story was the \"first\" maid, Lee Jeong-eun. She was really brilliant throughout and I don't understand why she wasn't nominated.I didn't see \"The Joker,\" but I did see \"1917\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" -- both superb movies, and also \"The Irishman\" -- which I detested. So, of the 3 that I saw, \"Parasite\" was definitely the most unique.I'm not sure this is a film I could watch more than once, but on the other hand, it might be worth studying.Very clever, very different. Yes, a bit slow in the beginning, and some questionable moments, but overall two thumbs up.\n",
      "Interesting story, good acting and very good directing.It was far overrated for what it was and it's sad that something this average gets accolades for the sake of promoting inclusivity. It certainly was worth a watch but it didn't deserve any awards.\n",
      "I love the whole movie, including the cinematography as well. It depicts what the director and writers wants to convey. In all aspects, all I can say is I'm very impressed. The beautiful architecture of the house plays a big part in telling the story of the movie too.This movie also talks about the rich and the poor in Korea. It tells you how different their life could be, and how it affects one's personality. The characters are interesting too. It brings out the mysterious side of the movie. When I finished watching, I can't just say it's a movie of one genre.You should watch this to understand what I meant. Go go!\n",
      "I came to watch the movie with great expectations. What can i expect from an oscar winner right? Well oh boy was I wrong. Parasite doesn't really shine on any of the areas that make a movie great. Plot, relatable actors, authenticity, dialogue, directing are just mediocre. One thing that was on par with perfect though was the screenplay. Each scene had a exact idea of what to cover and how to do it. It went superb with the plot that by all standards was very very slow and predictable.If you're looking for something unforgettable, don't pick this movie. It surely is one to be forgotten and one that doesn't excite, bring joy or happiness.One word review: meh.\n",
      "It is not a good movie. I am shocked. why people like this movie\n",
      "I am going to keep this very short and spoiler free, this was beautifully filmed, great acting, great script, it was laugh out loud funny and enormously dark. It also had a social commentary, it was simply brilliant, it is a good while since I enjoyed a film this much.\n",
      "I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.Filming a movie is like painting a picture, you need to put time and effort into it and boy the people who worked on this film knew what there doing.\n",
      "There is no action in the first hour and a half, but still i loved to watch every single part, family problems combined whit some action on the last part. Just gold.\n",
      "A great movie with outclass direction,Script,Story,Acting,Music all was too good,even before this movie south korea produce many masterpiece but we surprised win first time Cannes Prestigious ( Palm Di\"or Award ,France) BAFTA( UK) Australian Academy award,Golden Globe , Screen Actor guild award & Oscar award etc this the only movie was in Oscar(2020) was tottaly deserve to win Best direction,Best movie,Best orignal script award\n",
      "OK the film is technically beautiful. So forget that. In an era of global inequality this film inverts reality. The rich in this film are lethargic and foolish, the poor are schemers. In reality, it is the rich who are the schemers and rip off artists (how else would they get rich) and the poor who are not able to survive. No rich person worth their salt would ever be as dumb as they rich people are. No way. No in South Korea and not in America. It is the rich who constantly scam the poor into working for them at ridiculously low wages. No rich person ever hires a driver without 5 million checks first. That just doesn't happen. That being said, the moments where the poor get to live like rich people in the house are moving. Because no American film would ever touch inequality like this, it was a shock to the system. And the ending is pure Tarantino meaningless violence, like what do we do for the ending? Have a guy coming running out with a knife...Which means there is no ending.\n",

      "This movie is not as it got of credit. It doesn't deserve an Oscar. It's a very simple movie with a simple story and no extra efforts, effects or performance were there. 6 is its max\n",
      "Horrible movie. There's no script at all. All the humble people - ALL - are portrayed like animals, with no principles. The director way of filming is disrespectful to the actors, which is not common in Korea. Korean movies are more elaborated, respectfull, and deep. This movie is empty.\n",
      "Greatest film I've seen to date. Nothing more to be said.\n",
      "I wont review this film. Just will say that this film is captivating & powerful. Brutal portrayal of class struggle left me depressed for long time & influenced one my own life decision.Movie should be like this. I will give it 10/10.\n",
      "The story of the film is simple, with no clichés or predictable scenes. As we watch the film, we become more and more attached to the content transmitted there, the light touch of humor makes the film very pleasant. The innovation that Joon-Ho Bong brings in this script is spectacular, simple, but at the same time genuine. Even with very common scenarios and mediocre performances, the film is excellent, really worthy of Oscar. This production shows that we should not be stuck with Hollywood productions, get out of the box, look at the world, there are several other masterpieces like this all over the world without due recognition.\n",
      "As the title suggests, Parasite is my all time favorite film. Bong's original screenplay is one of the freshest and most original ideas I've ever seen/heard of. The idea of a poor family leeching off of a rich family by pretending to be qualified is brilliant. There truly has not been any other film like parasite and I think it should be appreciated as such. The characters and dialogue throughout the film strike as very realistic which is why everything that happens during the flick strikes the viewers very hard. The ending left me in a very depressed state and changed my view of the world a bit. It helped me realize of privilege and how the world just isn't that great. Upon thinking about the film later, I also wondered what the movie would've been like in the Kims' perspective. I believe this movie is one of the greatest ever made, and is an instant classic\n",
      "There's so much to love about this film. From its acting, music, set piece, cinematography, props and more, Bong finds some way to compress so much into a 2+ hour film and the quality is still perfect. The many themes and genres this film has, comedy, satire, drama, horror, thriller, family, you still don't get confused on what your watching no matter the theme or genre the scene is centred around. The films main message about rich and poor was portrayed comedically and horrifically. There's just too much to write about in one preview that a reader will stay attentive to, but the film very much deserved it's 4 oscar wins. no English remake please thanks\n",
      "The story is about the interaction of two Korean families, poor and rich - Park.In both families, fathers are the lazy guys. Classical now.\n",
      "The kids are mostly autonomous and self-made due to the laziness of their parents. Classical as well.The interaction starts with a lucky meeting of an old friend by the young man from the poor family which allowed him to start his work for a rich family. This is normal and gives him big money and now he can help his family.But he lied to the Mother of the Park family to create a position for his sister. The sister has strong greed and asks a high price for her work from Park's family. And then created a plan for how to put all her family into a rich house by kicking out all old stuff. Greed can kill you, remember it until the end episode.\n",
      "Also, there is a question, why Mother from Park family is simple? It's unsafe. And why Father from Park family didn't join the family decisions? Probably he has problematic pride. And they are both lazy and it's also can kill you, remind it as well.In conclusion:\n",
      "Don't be lazy and control your greed. As well as part attention for your partners or other people whom you délicate something or who affections on your life.If someone is dominated and another is submission in will kill one in them. Beca careful and pay attention.\n",
      "Overall a decent movie that differs from recent successful thrillers, but the movie isn't as exciting as you would expect. Lots of time you are sitting there hoping for speed up story telling. The tension between the two families isn't really build up, so the end comes surprising.\n",
      "I will not waste anymore of my time. I already wasted too much watching it. Terrible.I guess great if you are Korean.The oscars trying to make up for past mistakes........terrible movie.\n",
      "It seems like everything that's needed to be said about Parasite has already been said. Fantastic movie that can be taken at surface level or read into. The tension and suspense builds up to levels I have seen in few other movies. It stays with you.\n",
      "The first half of the movie was slow but not in the bad way. It builds up each character, gives you an interesting story to keep your attention and shows the true nature of each of our main characters, all before the second half of the movie which is packed with tense moments that made me want to hold my own breath and ends with exactly what I wanted the story to end with, a great conclusion with a satisfying ending.The music and acting throughout was great and made each scene shine as bright as it could. Overall, Parasite is a really good film and was really fun to watch, very interesting and would highly recommend!\n",
      "I must confess to a long time bias against sub titles, like many lazy Americans, I felt like having to read while I watched a movie was just asking too much. Then, a few years ago, I sat down and viewed a DVD of the fully restored SEVEN SAMURAI, and really understood what I had been missing out on for too long, especially when it came to Asian cinema. So when Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE won the Best Picture Oscar, I didn't feel any of the dread at having to listen to a foreign tongue while reading along with the screen that might have come a few years back. Now, after watching last year's Best Picture on Blu Ray, I say that for me, PARASITE is so good, I wasn't aware that I was reading anything after a first few minutes.Set in South Korea, the film works both as a thriller, and at times, a comedy of manners, along with a strong social commentary theme. I could see strong influences of both Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder in the script, which centers on two families, the Kims and the Parks. The former are stuck in poverty, living in a cramped basement apartment, while the latter are quite wealthy, living in a spacious house, attended by a housekeeper and chauffer. When the Kims' son manages to snag a job as an English tutor to the Parks' teenage daughter, the family has a foot in the door, and soon the rest of the Kims, under false identities, have infiltrated the household, taking over the jobs of therapist to the ADD afflicted younger son, housekeeper and chauffer; finagling to have others fired from the last two jobs in order to obtain them for themselves. The Kims are soon enjoying a newfound prosperity at the expense of their obliviously self absorbed employers. But their deviousness has consequences, and when the former housekeeper shows up one night when the Kims have the Parks' house all to themselves, the story takes a turn no one sees coming. Giving away anymore of the twists the story takes would be unfair, needless to say, this is one of those films that goes in a lot of unexpected places.There were some things that really stood out for me in this film. One was how well it works as a suspense film, liberally borrowing the situational irony that was a hallmark of Hitchcock - a scene where three of the Kims have to hide themselves in the Park house and attempt to sneak out while Mr. and Mrs. Park go about their intimate business is a great example of this, along with Hitchcock's patented voyeurism. Characters practicing deception was one of Wilder's signature themes, with the consequences of such deceptions playing out in the finale. Second was the theme of class warfare, how the Have-Nots, with their cunning and guile, easily manipulate their supposed Betters, while the latter feel wholly invincible in the superiority their wealth has brought them, making them easy marks. Third was how well the characters are written. The Kims commit reprehensible acts in a cold blooded manner, yet they really do love each other in a way that makes it impossible to totally condemn them. Even the fired housekeeper, who is revealed to have a skeleton in her closet, is motivated by love for a family member. I love films with complicated characters who are more than what they appear to be. The screenplay, written by Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won is a masterpiece of storytelling, especially in the way they introduce a plot twist late in the second act that has only been slightly foreshadowed, and how they get so much story out of small everyday things, like a food allergy, the Morse code that a Boy Scout learns, and the musty scent of a damp basement. This puts me in mind of Vince Gilligan, and his masterful TV shows BREAKING BAD and BETTER CALL SAUL. Lastly, if there is a theme to PARASITE, I would say it is that no matter what the difference in culture may be, human nature is universal.The acting, especially Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam, as the devious Kims, is exceptional. But real star is director Bong Joon-ho, who won the Best Director Oscar for his work. My choice for Best Picture would have been ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, but I can't be too bummed out when my favorite lost to a movie as good as PARASITE.\n",
      "It has been a longtime since I've had a viewing experience so unique for an initial watch and even more unique for the rewatch. There is so much to appreciate about this film on a surface level and even more the deeper you look into it. Simply put amazing. This film is best to see when you don't know too much about the plot.\n",
      "Parasite is just like that worm in the film you'll notice later in the film when.\n",
      "Pretty good film but not even close to living up to the hype of the praise it gets. My guess is that the Hollywood Elite have embraced this movie as a way to virtue signal that they get the suffering and unfairness of it all!Acting is good, movie is too long for sure, all unlikeable characters mostly\n",
      "Parasite is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you feeling both gut-wrenchingly uncomfortable and weirdly uplifted. The acting is top-notch, the plot is twisty and thrilling, and the social commentary will have you questioning the very nature of class and privilege. But let's be real here, the real star of the show is Bong Joon-ho's direction. The man is a genius and I will stan him until the end of time. If you haven't seen this movie yet, cancel all your plans and go watch it. Trust me, you won't regret it (except maybe for the fact that you'll never be able to unsee that iconic stair scene). 10/10, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a mind-blowing film experience.\n",
      "The director seems obsessed with the battle between the have and have nots...Parasite.in essence, was similar to his sci film Snow Piercer, where the poor battle to reach the home of the wealthy.in Parasite we have a poor unemployed family trying to get ahead at the largesse of a wealthy family, which they con into employing them. Things eventually go bad because they abused the breaks they had given them.In the end I was left with an unsatisfied feeling...as if justice had not been done.\n",
      "This movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time.\n",
      "Each time I watched Parasite I picked up something new\n",
      "Movie will grip you and keep hold of you until the end. Very deep, meaningful story of 2 Korean families at near opposite ends of sociology-economic spectrum. Amazing how much they have in common, however their differences are brought to life by the director in painful scenes, imagery, and tons of symbolism.A must watch.\n",
      "Parasite is a fantastic film made by the wonderful Bong Joon Ho. Every single frame is beautifully crafted and the story was investing throughout the entire two hour runtime. It is very darkly hilarious, smart, and overall excellent. It also has without a doubt one of the most realistic endings in film history. With a single flaw in sight, Parasite will be perfect for any movie-goer.\n",
      "A poor family all scam their way into the service of a rich family. It all seems like a madcap caper and then the film just turns into a terrifying and unpredictable thriller. The middle part of the film is set against a heavy downpour of rain. The flood sequences are very impressive. Very good film.\n",
      "The movie story was excellent and could be better and I am very sad for ki young death\n",
      "In more years than I want to think about, I never would rate a movie a 10. However, this was impressive. From dark comedy, to violence, to reading everything (which is difficult because I'm not much of a reader) to dissecting each character, it blew my mind. I kept thinking about it days on end. I kept wondering what details I missed that I wanted to find again. This movie is for the creative mind. It isn't for those who just see black and white. From production to writing to music to directing, it was an incredible movie. I'm looking forward to waiting a year or so, so I can relive that magic again.\n",
      "How did this beat 1917? Another terrible Hollywood film only made to over correct some\n",
      "Misguided California value that means nothing. This movie sucked.\n",
      "I liked it, just don't understand why it got so hyped . I don't find anything too special about the movie ; yeah there are a couple twists but nothing new.\n",
      "Superbly entertaining from start to finish. An original insight into class culture and beautifully shot. The film is particularly valuable if you want an insight into a working family in Korea with a balance of wit and drama throughout.\n",
      "In a hurry, I finally saw Parasite and it wasn't sooo great.\n",
      "I was not convinced by his grotesque / black comedy style, certain repetitions, some too long scenes, his low blows and some formal gloating.\n",
      "And the worst: a lot of concern about the MESSAGE: the characters are almost puppets at the service of a message ..., but a message that came out, moreover, frankly reactionary.Visually brilliant.\n",
      "The movie is good, but not a masterpiece. It was also reasonably exciting. So I don't regret having watched the movie.At the end, events come to a head and the following question arose after the movie was over:\n",
      "How can it be that the father of the \"parasites\" was able to live unnoticed in the bunker of the house? After the bloodbath in the garden, the whole truth should have come to light: from the nesting of the \"parasite family\" to the hidden husband of the former housekeeper in the bunker. In other words, the police would also have searched the bunker and found the father of \"Mr. Kevin\" there.\n",
      "The hype following this film was real and I saw it at the Scotiabank Theatre Toronto in Dec 2019. And I left that theatre stunned and in a trance of bad ass cinema.The peach montage scene alone... I think its somewhere between 5 to 8 minutes and there are 60 shots in that. That alone will make your jaw drop.The detail in this movie is masterful and this does what cinema or what a great movie should do: it should grip you, expand your mind, captivate you, and take you on a hell of a story that involves a fine balance of acting, sound, visuals, and believing in the story. This film did all that and RESPECT!!!!!!\n",
      "With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.MASTERPIECE!\n",
      "Parasite is hands down a must see movie. I did not expect to be blown away, but once the movie ended, I sat there in silence and had to take a moment to process everything. The concept is amazing and it's hard to even imagine that someone actually thought of it. Parasite 100% deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars. I laughed, I cried, and overall, I just enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The creators, directors, cast, and crew are so talented and I truly think that everyone should watch it at least once.\n",

      "Parasite is a masterpiece. You can find reality, critic to the society, well measured conversations and moments, thriller, terror, comedy...The movie shows the difference between the South Korean rich and poor society, having amazing shoots, that without words can provide a lot of information that makes you to sumerge in the movie.I absolutely recomend the movie. Best movie I have seen lately.\n",
      "I stumbled upon this on IMDB and just had to watch it and I'm glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Everything about it was great, I was blown away! I am like many Americans that tend to avoid movies that are not in English. I feel like I'm missing visual aspects of the performance, and miss out on relevant inflections and nuances in speech patterns because I can't connect the words being spoken with the meaning of the words.With such good reviews I said screw it! No more will I limit myself to just American cinema and it paid off. Now I have a bunch of foreign films lined up to watch. I highly recommend seeing this, and if your like me with the subtitles just give it chance you wont regret this one.\n",
      "The story was really interesting and amusing.\n",
      "The plot was only a bit exciting at the beginning, so it was mostly boring.\n",
      "I give 6/10, but only because of the good story.\n",
      "South Korea, one of the colonial countries in East Asia, has a history of colonization.\n",
      "I actually fast forwarded the movie after climax. Still can't fathom how ki-woo's father didn't notice his son laying down blooded while entering the basement after commiting atrocity in the backyard? How ki-woo figured out that his father \"might\" be hiding in the basement all along.\n",
      "This movie isnt bad, far from it. But, also it really isnt that good as reviews and awards suggest, at least for me. Maybe i expected too much but nothing really revolutionary happens here. It has few funny scenes and a plot- twist like any other thriller/comedy approach. Social topics covered here didnt really touch me at all. I didnt feel bad for the poor nor for Parks family. Didnt even think about the movie after it was done, whilst i thought about every other oscar rewarded movie for a long time after watching.\n",
      "Anyways, its probably me, who enjoys development of characters and atmospfere in the movie and none of that can be found in Parasite.\n",
      "This is essentially the perfect film as it does everything - storytelling, visuals, sound, editing, acting etc. - to perfection.\"Parasite\" belongs in the discussion of the greatest films of all-time in my opinion and everyone who appreciates a good film should certainly watch this one.10/10\n",
      "It is complex and full of deep meaning, it tells a story of helplessness and despair, it is not a simple right and wrong, black and white. It made me think. I like it.\n",
      "Wonderful movie in 2K19, I'm watched this film several times, every time I'm thrilled. I specially thanks to movie director.\n",
      "Creating a delicate, yet powerful in its message, masterpiece, Bong Joon-Ho shows to the occidental world once again why South Korean cinema, his cinema in particular, is so great: alternating on point motifs to great performances by the actor, this film really earned its Oscar in the finest way.\n",
      "The cinematography, the story gets you, you can stop watching it, the suspense, the performance and acting is very very good but... is this an Oscar winner?? I don't think so... definitely a must watch and for sure you might enjoy it... just open your mind and be ready for something bizarre but watchable!!\n",
      "I usually don't watch Korean movies, but the hype has insisted that I delve into it. And I have to say, I don't regret it one bit. The cinematography, the secret hidden messages in many scenes, the eerieness yet explosive plot-twists- perhaps I live under a rock, but it's rare to find a plot remotely similar to this, at least in my experience. It was truly an interesting and exceptional movie. Almost a mind game, it's fun to catch what you've missed on the rewatch. Jammed packed with thriller and drama.\n",
      "I have deep roots in Korea and for obvious reasons i like korean cinematography.\n",
      "In this case i am really pleased that this movie is the first ever in history to have won an oscar as the best movie of the year and not being an english speaking one.\n",
      "What i do not get, is the hype around it. It is an OK movie, like a modern black-noir comedy thriller about nowadays korean society, and it depicts it quite well...BUT this is not enough to be so astonishingly over-rated. Tons of korean movies are better, but for some reason this year, whole word decided to give PARASITE the green light to the top of movies sancta sanctorum world.\n",
      "Outstanding balance between arthouse and mainstream. Solid acting, impressive direction, beautiful shooting, intense narration, unconvetional humor and story development. Brilliant.\n",
      "I am gonna be fast about this.\n",
      "The movie is boring in the first hour. I was constantly giving a look in the bar to see how mush is left!\n",
      "Let's talk about the second part where all the action took place. So, I understand why everything happened, about killing the rich guy etc. What I don't get is the scrip that wasn't something that blowed my mind. I was pretty sure when I saw the storm and the flooding house that someone would die in the end. In other words, I wasn't surprised at all with the killing scene. The interesting part was that the son somehow survived and was free and the part that father found to hide... But i am trying to be honest here, I don't give this movie 10 stars for making me focused on the action for 20 minutes.... That's why this movie is overrated!\n",
      "Everything is very good the characters the acting music story line a masterpiece the character development is very good writen i camera angel are perfect.\n",
      "Can't say I've ever watched a movie similar to this one. Because of the reviews I gave it two attempts to draw my attention and I'm glad I did.\n",
      "I found it thought provoking with a lingering sadness afterwards, the disparity across humanity.\n",
      "It's a well crafted film with a beating heart and a poignant premise.\n",
      "Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema.\n",
      "I'd heard a lot of good things about this film. People saying one of the best of the last ten years. And where I'm not sure about that, I'm sure it's a great film. You'd be hard pushed to find a genre for it. As it has a bit of everything. Really recommend giving it a watch. It's available on Prime now, there's also a black and white version that I watched but to be honest doesn't really bring much else to the film. Just felt a little pretentious. I've heard their also planning to remake this in Hollywood. So don't wait for that as we know it'll lose all the charm and subtleness of the original.\n",
      "I saw Joker, The Irishman, Ford V Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit and Once upon a time in Hollywood but i 100% agree with this movie winning the Oscar.\n",
      "Well done !\n",
      "Subtitle were a bit hard to follow. But overall unique and creative. Deserves best picture.\n",
      "Yes its a good movie but not nearly as good as Snowpiercer. That has lower rating for some unknown reason. Script is predictable and does not display any direct critique on the class conflict. so it could be easely missenterprited! The poor actually look unworthy in this supposed masterpiece. if thats not major flaw i dont know what is. acting is extrimply poor. camera -not bad but nothing special. overall ark is childish , no suspense or dramatic high points.\n",
      "It's a shame that this movie won so many awards over much better movies like 1917. This movie was terrible. Filled with unlikeable characters doing horrible things to others. It actually made me angry that this movie got so much critical acclaim. Very disappointed.\n",
      "This movie is must watch for everyone. If you never seen a Korean movie still go watch it. The Direction of this movie is so good. This movie is filled with many indirect references to the Society.\n",
      "Starts off deceptively light-hearted, then continuously accelerates into a series of gripping twists and turns. Exceptional movie.\n",
      "The fact that we are able to see this piece and appreciate it is amazing. God bless Korean pieces. Then end is in my opinion a way to keep the story alive.\n",
      "A morality tale that is uncompromising through to the end. Brilliant plotting, superb performances and direction, and art direction that surrounds you in the shiny opulence of the rich and the downtrodden squalor of the underclass.\n",
      "This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and my heart was racing in every scene. It has elements of all genres from comedy, suspense and thriller. After the movie ended I was speechless, it even brought me to tears and I still don't know why. The director successfully makes the viewers feel like they are part of the movie but also gets a message across about the standards of living for lower class Koreans. I had never heard of this director but after seeing Paradite, I'll be sure to check out his other movies!\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus, \"Parasite,\" is an extraordinary film that defies easy categorization. It is a complex and multi-layered exploration of class, capitalism, and the human condition. The film's title, \"Parasite,\" refers to the characters who are seen as opportunistic and manipulative, but the film's true focus is on the interwoven lives of two families from different social classes, and the psychological and political differences between them.We follow the Kim family, living in squalor and poverty in a cramped basement apartment. They see an opportunity when their son, Ki-woo, is hired as a tutor for their contrast, the wealthy Park family's, daughter. The Kims quickly begin to insinuate themselves into the lives of the Parks, with each family member taking on a role in the household. But as their schemes and manipulations become increasingly complicated, their facade begins to crumble, leading to a stunning and incredibly violent conclusion, as if this was a Greek tragedy.One of the most striking aspects of \"Parasite\" is Joon- Ho's ability to seamlessly blend different genres, incorporating elements of comedy, thriller, and social commentary. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction is evident in almost every aspect of the film, from the carefully crafted script to the expertly choreographed action sequences. The film's characters are complex and fully realized, with each member of the Kim family possessing their own distinct personality and motivations.Through its exploration of class dynamics and using socialist ideas and politics, \"Parasite\" asks difficult questions about the nature of privilege and inequality in our contemporary society. The film is particularly effective in highlighting the ways in which the wealthy exploit the labor of the poor, with the Parks relying on the Kims for a variety of household tasks, from cooking to driving.The cinematography of \"Parasite\" is particularly noteworthy, with each shot carefully composed to convey the psychological states of the characters. The contrast between the cramped and dingy Kim apartment and the pristine, modern Park home serves as a powerful metaphor for the social and economic divides between the two families. The film's use of light and shadow is also masterful, with the Kim family often depicted in darkness while the Parks are bathed in bright, natural light, which shows the thematic contrast between them even more.The performances in \"Parasite\" are all uniformly excellent, with each actor bringing nuance and complexity to their roles. Song Kang-ho is particularly memorable as the Kim family patriarch, struggling to keep his family afloat in the face of overwhelming economic hardship. Meanwhile, Park So-dam delivers a standout performance as the cunning and resourceful Kim daughter, constantly manipulating those around her to achieve her goals.Ultimately, \"Parasite\" is a film that defies easy categorization, blending elements of comedy, thriller, and social commentary to create a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience. Its exploration of class dynamics is both timely and timeless, and its characters are complex and fully realized. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction and the film's outstanding performances make \"Parasite\" a must-see for anyone interested in cinema that challenges and inspires, and one of the greatest films of this decade.\n",
      "Highly overrated film. Though performances are pretty good, the whole plot and most of the main scenes are so crazy that they take away credibility. Sometimes less is more.\n",
      "Very original, engaging, superb in every segment be it script,story,acting,camera,background music..in short must watch n definitely not to be missed movie.\n",
      "I was so looking forward to Parasite. What a disappointment. Is this the movie that has won all these awards and put Korea on the map? I sat through it waiting for something to spark my interest, anything that would raise this oriental potboiler social comedy of manners into high art. It failed to materialise. The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor. It was neither satirically funny enough or dramatic enough to be a stunning black comedy. Far too aware of itself. I did want to like this. I was anticipating another \"Roma\" but all I got was a frantic mess.\n",
      "Parasite combines multiple genres through a captivating story and interesting characters. The contrast in lifestyles between the Kims and the Parks is portrayed through the amazing camera work and the incredible set design.\n",
      "The acting is simply jaw-dropping. I'm glad that these insanely talented korean actors are getting exposure through this film and I hope to see them on the big screen more often.\n",
      "This movie is simply amazing. It's psychological, comedic, frighteningly real. I would highly recommend you watch it, but avoid spoilers, as they will ruin the surprises.\n",
      "The film wasn't at all what I expected but it was great. Realize bizarre story with great acting.\n",
      "The movie parasite shocked the american movie industry with it's simple idea which is the rich and the poor and trying to put them together in unusual picture and that happend really well.if you want to watch the movie i recommend you to watch and good luck.\n",
      "Often you can look at the awards given to a film and upon watching it wonder who gave large bags of cash to whom?\n",
      "In the case of Parasite, every good thing that has been said about this movie is true!\n",
      "Engaging, dramatic, funny, tragic, original and more.\n",
      "Congratulations to all those involved :)\n",
      "This is not about the first half or weird second half of the movie. Personally, I don't like stories that are so ridiculously unbelievable advertised as plausible. A good premise, that turned into a dumb plot twist that worked for the writer director but not me. In the end it made no sense and if all that happened it might have been news worthy but not cinema.\n",
      "I watched this movie based on it's IMDb rating. After all, it scored only 1/10th of a point lower than \"Lord of the Rings\" (first one) so it must be a pretty damn AWESOME movie, right? Well....NO! It wasnt a BAD movie, it just wasnt....magical.Now, I do love my Sci Fi and Fantasy movies, however movies based on real life can be magical as well. Think \"Silence of the Lambs\" or \"Se7en\". This movie has a decent concept based on the interactions of 2 classes of people. I would go so far as to say there is no clear \"good guy\" and no clear \"bad guy.\" In life, there seldom is. That said, it was interesting and entertaining but no way it ranks a 8.6. I think results are being skewed by a foreign market that has (understandable) pride in making a film with international appeal.\n",
      "I have watched some Korean movies, part of which I genuinely liked, but this one...how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me. I have to admit, that those have been some of the longest two hours, that I have spent in a movie Theater. The movie is neither funny (it might be the dubbing, but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie), nor shocking (unless You haven't seen movies before), it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters, it was absolutely predictive, drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom. Yes, it covered different genres, but other movies did the same, just much better.\n",
      "I didn't feel long at all of the movie as the plot was so grabbing. Despite the dramatic shifts on plots and the human characters, I very much related to the human side of things. Big Kudos to the entire team on every aspect!\n",
      "What a masterpiece. Easily the best film to come out in years and well deserving of an Oscar!\n",
      "Draws you in with a scheming family trying to make it and unfolds into an incredible and biting film of social commentary. Using a brilliant embedded visual metaphor of vertical space for class relations, there is always more underneath than what you see. The film has a pace that reaches fever pitch and packs a punch of shock and serious reflection.\n",
      "I have heart a lost about this movie and that normally makes me a bit sceptic. But this flick really took me by surprise. The story begins pretty normal and then somewhere in the middle everything goes downhill - in a good way. The ending is epic and totally outrageous. A must-see for all drama loving viewers. More suspense than all horror movies combined, without being one.\n",
      "Wonderful movie and immaculately written. Shows satire perfectly and both the acting and storytelling is exquisite. But ain't no Moreno than this, shows the satire, the world we living in.\n",
      "Wow, i've never seen a thriller like this, the storytelling is just brilliant, with a thrilling plot reveal aswell. This movie just got more and more intense for every minute and i was so captivated at the second half of this movie. The cinematography is outstanding, the scene i remember most for the cinematography is the basement scene. That scene is filmed brilliantly. This is one of my favourite foreign movies ever (Still not the best, that still belongs to La vita é bella(1997).9/10.\n",
      "This film didn't impress me.\n",
      "But \"Joker\" did...and i weep at theater and felt catharsis.\n",
      "I'm a fan of a lot of international movies which break out of the Hollywood mold, but not this one. Could barely sit through it, and should have walked out early. It never got better. Some people seem to like it, but there are a lot of overly inflated reviews here. Maybe I'm rating too low, but I could not think of anything about it to rave about. OK...maybe the acting wasn't too bad, but the plot and script overall are a 1.\n",
      "\"Snowpiercer\" is certainly the most competent Marxist allegory I've yet seen, so I looked forward to \"Parasite\" as a more ground-level discussion of how vast wealth warps society and leads to dire results.\n",
      "It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: \"trickle down\".\n",
      "\"Trickle down\" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom.\n",
      "Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen.\n",
      "There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with.\n",
      "But they're not happy, and anyone who believes \"trickle down\" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision?\n",
      "A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see.\n",
      "After seeing this I am not liking any other movie\n",
      "This film was nothing short of amazing. The writing, characterization, cinematography, acting, directing and more were all insane. I thought I wouldn't like this film because it's in Korean and I thought reading subtitles would be a drag but it was the exact opposite. Every moment you are on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next.\n",
      "I'm not an award chaser, or the kind of person who thinks something is good just because it had the best campaign for a murky board of the powers-that-be. That isn't why this movie is great, but it is great. The direction and cinematography are excellent. They create a perfect narrative scene. The movie is easy to follow without spoon feeding. It is interesting, dramatic (a genre with a lot of terrible films), quirky and surprising, a little humorous, beautiful, sad, hopeful, thrilling, action packed, raw, real, and more. I don't gush about many movies like I am this one, but there isn't a thing I would change about it.Do yourself a favor and watch it.\n",
      "Parasite 2019 is a movie about a poor family's tragedy who wanted to live a better life than they have but ended up far worse than they already were. This great movie showed struggle, cunningness of people, lives of poor and rich people, poor people's cravings for a better life, desperation, rich people's view toward poor people and much more. The director of the movie Bong Joon-ho was able to show exactly what he wanted in the movie. This movie earned a lot of awards such as academy award for best picture, academy award for best writing, academy award for best directing etc.\n",
      "Parasite tells the story of two inverse families: the Parks and the Kims. The Kim family work low paying jobs while barely living above ground. The Park family has everything readily available and they live in a beautiful, bright, modern contemporary home. The poor family lived in a slum and lived their life by creating packs for products. Then fortune came with a bottle of alcohol and his friend who told him to teach a rich family's daughter English language because he was very good in it. Then ki hoo gave the rich family's son an art teacher who was none other than his own sister Ki-jeong. But the Park family were unaware of it. Through his sister the rich family selected the father of the poor family Dong-ik as their driver. Also he cunningly made his wife their house worker. All of this happened and the rich family had no idea about it. This showed how fortunate and cunning people can be.\n",
      "Later in the movie while the Parks went on a vacation the Kim family came into the house and was partying but they were caught up in a bad situation. They found out that previous house worker was keeping his husband in a secret bunker of the house. Later the previous houseworker Moon-gwang found out what the kim family did so they decided to imprison them in that room and they did. But while doing it the previous house worker died in front of his husband. After that we can see that Mr Kim's home was flooded and the desperation they were in. At the last scene of the movie we can see that Geun-sae the husband of the previous house worker Moon-gwang went on a rampage and stabed Mr Kim's daughter. Mr kim managed to kill Geun-sae and demanded to Mr park to give him the keys to the car so he can take his daughter to the hospital. But Mr park makes a face of disgust at Geun-sae's smell and it triggerss Mr kim. He fatally stabs Mr Park and then runs out of the party. But he didn't actually escaped, he took Geun-sae place which was discovered by his son later who made a promise to himself to to work hard, make a bunch of money, and buy the house, allowing his father to finally roam free again. The final scene of Parasite fades away from Mr kim's sons fantasy to reveal him still in the Kim family's original barely-above-ground apartment.\n",
      "The story was different. Poor people always crave for a better life, but here they cheated their way to a better life. But god won't accept it and that's what the writer wanted to show. If one resort to cheating and deceiving it will only end more badly. Also we can't only dream about a great future. We have to work on it. People can get a reminder of it after watching this movie.\n",
      "Movie isn't necessary a masterpiece if it is foreign movie! and certainly isn't a comedy genre. Movie is aesthetically attractive but it is mostly filmed indoors on two locations.Soundtrack is unnoticeable. I expected much of this movie but than reality kicked soon. After almost 90 minutes of pure boredom, movie suddenly transforms into typical Korean horror movie, which might be appealing to some teenagers but not to me.\n",
      "Weakest part of movie is unconvincing story.For example: parents are poor,badly educated and unemployed but suddenly,overnight, father becomes perfect personal driver of luxury Mercedes limousine and mother ideal housekeeper.Daughter on other hand has vast knowledge about art history. Nobody knows about house basement/panic room and perfect luxury villa doesn't have a single camera or video surveillance...yeah,right... That's how you make scenarios for typical B-grade horror movie,not for serious melodrama.\n",
      "What a though provoking film. It is quiet and smart. It is the type of film that one tends to ponder about long after seeing it.\n",
      "The narration in first half is slightly misleading by being racy while the actual film is meant to be about class divide and how the rich and poor see each other. The film would be more classy if the narration style was consistent. Still a good watch\n",
      "Before watching this film, I wondered and strongly believed that the title \"Parasite\" referred to Kims' family - an obvious choice for them being the ones feeding on their host (and rich) family. But the hopeful ending (for Kims) made me realize that Bong Joon Ho does not see Kims as villains. He imagined this movie as a class warfare. And like any war, this one had the winner too - the Kim family. Apparently, for Bong this movie is about the shortcomings of (late) capitalism.And I am here thinking how is capitalism the villain in a story of a murderous, cheating, fraudulent family of Kims who decide to get rich at the expense of others (i.e. work in a non-capitalistic way). But in a world where socialism is on the rise; where the poor demand the rich to pay for their living because why not; where an individual is responsible for everyone else but himself/herself this movie is the type of crap that would sell.\n",
      "I love korean movies very much, but this, this is the first time i review a movie, because i really like it, and i heard Parasite won the oscar 2019 woow\n",
      "I saw this film in an empty cinema with my girlfriend around a month ago now and i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. If you can, see this film without having any idea about what to expect and i guarantee you'll have a more enjoyable viewing experience. The twists and turns throughout are done crazily well and almost everything that happens within the film comes as a surprise to the viewer. Easily the best film of the last 2 years for me and should be talked about in cinematic history for many a year to come.\n",
      "NOW THAT'S A MOVIE. Everything from the opening to the closing was quite the spectacle. This is a modern day masterpiece. Masterful Cinematography. Bong's a genius when it comes to building up tension in this film. Everything from color grading, angles, and mise en scene were done with intention, providing a treasure trove of symbolisms that draw up a larger social commentary about the state of poverty in Korea. The best part of this film was its ability to bend genres, serving up comedy and drama so naturally.\n",
      "I just can't believe it... no matter how many times I watch this movie, it always has an impact on me. It always leaves such strong emotions, it makes you wonder about many things, especially your way of thinking and behaving towards people. I love this movie and I am forever grateful for it - it shows how money makes the world go round... and not in a good way.\n",
      "My movie viewing has matured over the years as it should, but still not a fan of subtitles but films like this has changed my mind and rightfully so. The movie is so good that after you watch it twice(which you will if you loved it) you barely have to read them not because of predictably but because it says exactly what you're thinking and its brilliant screenplay and directing. Sometimes reading subtitles and culture of other countries are hard to put altogether, not this time. The film is emotional, funny(dark), endearing, suspenseful, and exactly what movies are supposed to hit on. It's a home run and don't let the low ratings steer you away from this, it almost did me but, once again I overcame my angst and settle in for actually one of the best movies I've ever seen--definitely the Best Foreign movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Give that Parasite a hand and A OSCAR well deserved!\n",

I admire the movie director who is very wonderful.\n",
      "Absolutely wow! One of the best movies I have ever seen. It started like a fun movie it became a little bit like a comedy movie. Sometimes it was frightening if they almost got caught and later it became like a dark/horror movie it's such a good movie.\n",
      "Ok, let's start with why I liked this movie.To be honest, I'm more of a horror, thriller person. I'm a fan of hereditary and Midsommar. But this might be one the movies that changed my cinematic experience forever.Firstly, the plot and story is genius. This movie expands into a realistic yet terrifyingly accurate world. The movie of course is carried on the idea of the treatment of class in our modern day society. The 1st half and 2nd half and two sides on this complex story of a symbiotic relationship. Amazing movie!Highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to be surprised at a movie!!\n",
      "Parasite is one of the most special projects of this decade .. the movie always switchs up from comedy to thriller to action to even sometimes horror !The poster itself speaks to the moment you see it you see the black lines on the eyes of the poor family , and the white lines on the rich family .. shows the contrast between the two and that it's not a thing only a few people can relate to but all the societys can. And the legs of a dead woman on the floor and you don't know why then you see the rock that the son holds and then your questions intensifies and increases .. all this for you just to say wow ! This is special and it is .. it always hints something artistic that you for some reason .. understand it immediately .. you understand each and every character .. what they do and how they think , and this is not easy at all .. you know that the director is genius when he/she puts something like that rock and use it as a symbol for many many things that you can analyze on your own ... At first the poor family put faith in it that will bring them wealth .. then it's used by the the son as a weapon to defend his family's opportunity of being happy he'd do anything for that wealth ... But then it was used against him .. he dropped on the floor with blood all over the place due to his selfishness .. it shows how much a man can do when he has the upper hand .. how ugly , selfish , without mercy he can be .. or how his father was talking to him about plans while he was covering his eyes ( blind ) and talking about that you can't plan life .. it's hard and painful .. he gave up but he is angry ... Look at the character development ! How realistic it is , how understandable it is .. that's why he didn't hesitate to kill the rich father when he casually and with discust he moved a poor man's dead body only to get his car keys .... Here the poor father exploded with anger .. he transformed completely.And then his son learns the lesson .. that if you want to succeed in this life you have to work hard and dedicate yourself.This film is really special to me and I don't think we are get a masterpiece like this any time soon !\n",
      "This was my first Korean movie I´ve watched. And definitely won´t be my last. I have wanted to watch this movie since it got its rewards but never quite had a calling to actually watch it.It was a very good movie that showed me a lot of things that I guess I needed to see.The family was really clever and sneaky and I really enjoyed how they managed to do all of it and get away with it for that little while.The movie had 2 hours but it felt like 45 minutes to me because I just merged into the movie as if I was in it.It was very interesting and I have never seen such a movie.I usually prefer fantasy, romance or sci:fi. But this has opened a lot of movie opportunities for me and I am grateful for that.Some of the moments that got stuck in my head was when the father was telling his son about making plans. And that his plan is to make no plan because in the end you are less dissapointed because nothing goes precisesly according to the plan.\n",
      "Just when you think you understand exactly what's going on, TWIST, and everything changes. Can't wait to see it again. Fabulous performances.\n",
      "Very good movie, it has a twist that you are not going to believe, you need to watch this movie.\n",
      "It's weird how a movie can be so disturbing yet so hilarious at the same time, as well as a lot of gruesome moments towards the end. The acting was excellent and the scenes were not predictable which is what made it very intriguing. Not going to lie, my heart was racing in some of the scenes. 100% recommend watching this movie, truly a masterpiece.\n",
      "I didn't see anything special about this movie. It wasn't unique, mind provoking, mind blowing or anything special. I feel I've seen several similar movies in the past. I think if you keep everything the same except for the language, setting and subtitles (American made) then this movie would have been just another, 'it was okay', movie.\n",
      "Movie is just awesome. It reveals dark secrets of the life. Must watch movie.\n",
      "I couldn't really understand the meaning of the title before watching this movie and, as soon as I watched it, I immediately made the connection and thought it was the perfect headline for such a piece of art of the actual cinema.Parasite narrates the story of a desperate family, whose condition is meticulously depicted: a dirty, small, underground house with narrow corridors and a short ceiling, full of insects (which are, in turn, the parasites of their house) and exposed to every kind of mistreatment by society and any disgrace (such as the flood).What is the effect of desperation on human beings? Becoming extremely selfish, ruthless... They'd take advantage of everything to survive and obtain what they crave for.In our case, every member of the poor family manages to infest the rich one, by ruthlessly eliminating anyone on their way, like a virus: destroying all of the defenses and feeding themselves with the victim's body (the rich family's wealth).I appreciated that the storyline was very unusual and involving, and also made me reflect about two important themes, which constitute a real issue in nowadays society, and appear to be highly criticized in the movie: the power of recommendations and the superficiality of rich people.Respectively, the topic of networking: being \"close\" to a relevant person in the working environment can be crucial to obtain a job, no matter who you are and what your abilities... I believe the movie points the finger against corruption in the working places.Secondly, rich people's naivety: the stereotype of rich people being seen as very gullible and superficial is clearly shown by the wealthy family's behaviors: they appear to be blind to what reality looks like, they only see the superficial part because they are convinced to be able to buy everything with money, they see money as the certainty to all the best in life and seem to never have experienced anything bad in life, because they were lucky enough to live in the right part of this society, in which money leads everything and everyone.What I didn't appreciate about Parasite, though, was the absence of a deep characterzation of the protagonists, which I personally would have added, to empathize more with them, and some forcings in the plot, which made it less realistic (as, for instance, the ending: the poor family's father ends up sending morse signals to his son, which understands everything he wants to communicate).Overall, however, I'd really recommend watching this movie, because, other than very well-made graphically, has a lot to leave to the spectator.\n",
      "This is the first time I really felt like writing a review because I LOOOOVE this movie it's truly a masterpiece! The amount of attention to detail is absolutely insane!\n",
      "This film does everything well, the way it is written generates one of the best rhythms that I have seen in a film of this magnitude, the plot is built in such an interesting way that at all times you are aware of what is going to happen or in tension of key moments in history. The construction of the characters is very well defined in both families, with realistic personalities and behaviors, about the direction and script of Bong Joon-ho is magnificent and is evidenced in the final result with the subtext before the criticism of classism and clearly the title of the work where the parasites are reflected in both extremes, both the Park that benefit from the workforce of the Kim, and the families of less resources that benefit from the wealth of the Park family, both the Kim family and the people who were hiding in the bunker. The production design is also perfect to favor the concept of the film, building the first floor of the main home from scratch or using the stairs as a metaphorical narrative resource. Ending with cinematography, the photographic direction seems incredible to me and in addition to being of high quality, it is connected with the general concept of the division of social classes simply accompanied by visual resources such as literal lines or the simple fact of raising or lowering levels , at the narrative and literary level it is also complete to generate a true impact with events such as the deaths and dreams of families, in general I believe that this film will revolutionize the artistic level of other productions with so much acting, technical and directing talent, it is a example of South Korea to the world.\n",
      "I still can believe that a Korean movie crashed everyone in the Oscars! I am really glad that happened. And the good news is that the movie actually is fantastic. Maybe Joker was a better film but who is going to give Joker a chance? Better Parasite than 1917!\n",
      "This is very amazing movie...fun.thriller,sadness is there in overall movie..This is well written and well performed original film. The naretive and the actors were excellent . Parasite has made me think more than most films i have seen. They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean \"they\" I mean bother the working class and upper class. You could easily argue that \"parasite\" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be greatful about it too!Give it watch , see it with friends or family Members... you'll enjoy this movie a lot.\n",
      "Short and simple review: I had fun watching it but I don't see the greatness. It was somewhat original and the actors did a fine job yet I'm still trying to figure out why it swept the Oscars. Not a bad movie but far from top 100 material.\n",

      "With an Oscar win and liking his previous movies mother and Snowpiercer I figured this would be great as well. It's much slower then mother and didn't find the ending to be as good either.

      "\"Parasite,\" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a cinematic masterpiece that skillfully weaves together elements of dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. From start to finish, the film captivates audiences with its sharp storytelling, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking exploration of greed and class discrimination.The plot revolves around the symbiotic relationship that develops between two families from opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum. The Kims, a destitute and cunning family, infiltrate the lives of the affluent Park family through strategic manipulation. As they secure jobs within the Park household, the boundaries between the two families blur, leading to a tense and unpredictable narrative.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to seamlessly shift between genres, keeping the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction is evident in every frame, as he meticulously crafts a story that balances suspense and humor with a keen social commentary on class disparity.The performances of the cast are outstanding, with each actor delivering a nuanced portrayal of their characters. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek, the patriarch of the Kim family, gives a standout performance, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The chemistry between the members of both families feels authentic, adding depth to the film's exploration of the dynamics between the rich and the poor.Greed is a central theme in \"Parasite,\" and Bong Joon-ho cleverly uses the characters and their actions to expose the darker aspects of human nature. The film skillfully critiques the socio-economic divide, highlighting how the pursuit of wealth and success can lead to the erosion of empathy and morality.The cinematography and production design contribute significantly to the film's impact. The contrasting spaces inhabited by the two families symbolize the stark differences in their lives, creating a visual metaphor for the class struggle at the heart of the story. The use of symbolism and visual storytelling enhances the overall viewing experience, making \"Parasite\" a visually stunning and thematically rich film.In conclusion, \"Parasite\" is a groundbreaking cinematic achievement that transcends genres and leaves a lasting impression. Bong Joon-ho's direction, coupled with exceptional performances and a compelling narrative, makes this film a must-watch. Its exploration of greed and class discrimination is not only relevant but also delivered with a level of brilliance that cements its place as a modern classic in world cinema.\n",
      "Parasite is not for everyone.A section of audience will relate to it.It covers almost all genres.\n",
      "I watched this film a few months ago and was underwhelmed to say the least. Can't remember much of the finer points of the plot, which tells you all you need to know. Yawn.\n",
      "I watched this on Amazon Prime. I have rated over 3000 movies on IMDb and this is the 5th movie I have given a 10/10 rating. A movie about social standings, somewhere between a Dickensian novel and an Ealing dark comedy movie. It's a long movie but doesn't feel so, the writing is some of the best I've seen in years, the acting is superb and the general feel of the movie is brilliant. A movie to make you laugh, shed a tear and also contemplate. I doubt I will see a better movie for many years.\n",
      "One of the best movies I've ever seen in my whole life! I'm not into a Korean film making, but this masterpiece blew my mind! It's actually impossible to categorise it cuz it includes many diverse genres - slasher, suspense, drama, comedy, thriller... To my mind, all the cast delivered a great performance! So eye-catching contrast between wealthy and working-class people who have different needs, outlooks and values. The director extraordinarily carried this out! Impeccable!\n",
      "So many different emotions in this film. The director very well highlighted the theme of the movie and also made it spectacular to watch. Definitely worth a watch.\n",
      "I've watch this 5th times and still learn something brilliant. The Plot, The theme, cinematography, Acting, Architecture, All really Outstanding.\n",
      "*Message To Those Who Didn't Watched This Movie Yet.If You're Looking A Movie For Genre Crime,Thriller,Mystery ,Comedy, Drama, Romance, Emotional, It Is More Than These .And\n",
      "This Movie Will Not Disappoint You..*Note For Parents- This Movie Is Not Suitable For Those Who Are Under Age Of 15.\n",
      "Enjoyed it. Very unique narrative of the story and contrary to what others say, I enjoyed the 2nd half. It had great twists and unexpected turns.\n",
      "N a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected.\n",
      "Maybe i miss something but i wonder if there's a character you that represents a positive emotion or sympathy. All characters were parasites (and still you can't see a \"cow\"! Well, if you think that Almodovar meets Stephen King in Korea that's ok. i want to know, if any one believes this is the best movie ever would he of she will watch the film for a second time? Well, me no! Better from the Old boy? No! Funny? No! So 4 stars only for gasp of classes.-\n",
      "The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually did nothing wrong. The couple loved each other, their children were pleasant, they didn't cheat, they didn't have cold violence, they didn't abuse children, they were generous to drivers and servants, they were really kind and simple, but you just can't help hating them, hating them, hating them.\n",
      "I loved this film! It's one of those films that astonish you and make you think about the film much after it has ended.\n",
      "It studies class divide in a post-modern world and has so many elements to it that one needs to watch a video explaining the film.Sometimes it may feel over-exaggerating, but I can't fault the director for this style, which does truly make him the Kafka of our times.Thank you for the film of the year and congratulations on being the first foreign language film to win the Oscar!\n",
      "Solely based on social inequality and the consequences of capitalism, 'Parasite' is a film that demonstrates indirect friction between opposite social classes. Bong Joon Ho was writing in an attempt to reveal that Korea isn't as glamorous as one would think this is shown from the massive social gap between the Parks and Kims (from one of his press interviews 'but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair'). I think this is quite ironic as we saw the younger individuals were more likely to proceed into becoming slightly successful as they were the ones that secured the jobs for their whole family, also going back to the statement about the poor widening, but what stood in the way was another poor family who had the same idea but in the end both had different morals which ultimately lead to the demise of both poor families. This is just one of the reasons why this film was so incredible because even just talking about it sounds poetic and satisfying.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" is dizzying, brilliant and completely unclassifiable. Director Bong Joon-ho is targeting an increasingly polarized society, where the rich get richer and the poor are left to struggle to survive. Clearly he has achieved his goal, the film is undoubtedly interesting, but it is also full of anger and a strong sense of injustice.\n",
      "The fact that Bong Joon Ho was able to paint a picture so vivid, so devastatingly beautiful, funny, tragic and honest, be so precise and detailed, yet not get lost in the minute, and then stick the landing, should be an impossibility, but somehow, he made it work.\n",
      "I have never seen a movie which shows so skillfully how the poor (literally) tear each other apart in capitalism. But it goes much further than this, is much more creative, and imagines a story way bigger than just a critique of our society.\n",
      "Starts as satire, turns into a thriller, and ends as splatter / drama / comedy. Brilliant all the way through.\n",
      "Only the dialogues might take some getting used to for Western audiences at first.\n",
      "As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.\n",
      "Amazing story plot with thrilling scenes.The characters were so beautifully matched.\n",
      "Just when you think this can't go on like this it gets even worse.\n",
      "The hype is simply because it's foreign and people, as usual, are jumping on the bandwagon. There's nothing great about this film. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n",
      "Although watching a foreign movie can be daunting for some, Parasite is a great starting point. There are no weak elements to this movie and it is filled with clever reincorporation and satisfying pay-offs to earlier events. The sets are fantastic and the music is appropriate. All of the actors are stellar. This is a movie that all should see even if you don't think it'd be your type of thing.\n",
      "In every sense, this film captivates my heart. Everything from the story to the filming is fun.\n",
      "Awesome! First I was skeptical cause it wasnt an english movie. Then I thought! Why not watch it, it has high ratings. And I have been watching some real bad hollywood /American movies lately.Watch it indeed! You will be entertained, its a good movie and with good gore material! A mix of emotions will linger on with you long after the movie ends.\n",
      "At the end of the film, the most desperate people, through this event, the son's life lessons are: make money, become rich.\n",
      "However, the director's fable tells the audience that both are hell, and that this is a beautiful, cruel, funny and sad society.\n",
      "It has a beautiful beginning with beautiful pictures. A stunning home that I would be willing to watch again and again but the end was too tough and too ugly. I wish it could be rewritten and show people some hope.\n",
      "Much was said about this film, and when that happens it is difficult for reality to live up to expectations. In my case, it did. Its structure and script are sharp, and it is replete with subtleties and subtext. We need more films like Parasite.\n",
      "Literally.First, I always give pause for Cannes films since it's generally over pretentious \"film-viewers\" who think way too deep. It's a freakin' movie.As a US viewer, the cultural differences, not the class differences, is what got lost in this movie. Some of the social aspect which seemed such taboo are just \"meh\" in the US.I think if there was an \"Americanized\" version of this, it might ring more true, but I have 0 faith in Hollywood ever making anything good again.\n",
      "This movie is not worth watching.\n",
      "1- It is too Hollywood\n",
      "2- The movie started as a comedy and ended up as horror. To me it was like a horror version of Tom & Jerry cartoons. Way too silly.\n",
      "3- There was no need for all that killing because it did not fit the characters or this kind of a script\n",
      "5- Comparing it, for example, to \"No Country for Old Men.\" I would give No Country 9/10 and this one 4/10.\n",
      "6- Comparing it to all that garbage out there then yeah it was one step above garbage.\n",
      "Intellectually elite people look down on the kind of movies other people watch, the non funny jokes and the try too hard acting but it's not fair to except people to put in their brains in everything they do.\n",
      "Parasite meets the margins of great acting, direction, cinematography but what is the best thing is that it is not intellectually elite it serves a plain story like a flowing river and everyone can enjoy it. You can be far far away from this river and like it or choose to go into subtleties and like it.\n",
      "I also am glad that this Oscar winning movie is not just a heap of ache and pain as they usually are.\n",
      "I've watch this movie 5th times. And still learn something new, from many perspective: Story development, theme, cinematography, acting, ect.Well-deserved for oscar.\n",
      "Don't let the subtitles scare you, after a while you forget they're even there. It's like you just forget that you're even reading them and you get so caught up in the story. At first I wasn't sure where it was headed but it soon becomes clear. There is this poor family who sort of invades this rich family and starts living off of their wealth, hence the title Parasite. The son becomes a tutor for the family's daughter and then her recommends his own sister for a tutor for the rich family's son but he doesn't tell them it's his sister, and then they get a job for their dad and their mom as well. It's really clever the way it all unfolds. I wish they did stuff like that in other movies too because I really can't think of any and I really liked it.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best movies I have seen. This is not an arguable fact at this point, it is so well made and the story line is brilliant. The attention to detail in this movie astounds me. Every single thing has meaning, from the levels of the house to even the portrait that Da Song paints when he is younger, which looks more like Geun-sae than a self portrait. I really appreciate the commentary on the different classes, and how their perspectives are changed through dialogue, through clothing and even through lighting. The whole idea of how the upper class will only take action when something affects them is so prominent, with the Parks not even aware of the troubles of their workers until it affects them. And, even when they do find out, they only do what will help them and their kind, picking up Da Song and even stepping over a girl who has just been stabbed. It's such a stunning movie and I give it the utmost praise.\n",
      "Another thing this film comments on is the idea of the American Dream. At the end of the film, Ki-woo has an idea of working hard and buying the house that his father is trapped in. That is what the American Dream is, the idea that if you work hard and get an education, you can achieve everything. However, this will probably never happen for Ki-woo. It's mentioned at the beginning that he has been denied from schools in the past, but he thinks this time will be different. But it's the tragic truth that it probably won't be different. If it were, the film wouldn't end with that being a dream. It would cut off one shot earlier, with the father hugging his son, and then it ends. But there is that final shot, establishing that it's just goal that he won't be able to achieve. And so he starts off how he did at the beginning of the movie, socks hanging above his head and him sitting at his kitchen table in a basement.\n",
      "Parasite is a film capable of accompanying you in the narration halfway, hand by hand making you amazed and sometimes laugh at the situations that the family devises, then all of a sudden, the hand that accompanied you on that journey gives you a loud slap. And plunges you into an even more paradoxical situation, in which hatred and fear (which for the entire film remain slightly below the surface) take over, until the last scene that makes you understand the profound dramatic condition in which the family will have to live for years to come.\n",
      "Fun thriller and It's got good twist. Nothing mind blowing. Am i shocked this is best picture? yes.\n",
      "A well told tale of a family of have-naughts who lie their way into a job for each member in the home of a rich family. They engineer the firing of the people they replace. People who deserved nothing of the kind. Plus the son of the pushy family disregards his promise to the friend who set him up with this rich family and he totally moves in on the little school-girl daughter he was supposed to be safe guarding. While so engaged they find a secret. Or rather a secret is given them. This movie is beautifully shot and well presented. It's a story in movements. It has the power to draw you in so much so that you forget what things were like, back there in the beginning. Back there in the basement.\n",
      "I'll keep this short and sweet. What an overhyped pile of garbage. It had its moments, but after it was all said and done it was just a long Three's Company episode with a twist ending that was uninspired.\n",
      "The movie is quite amazing just as the title of this review said. You get to like the Kim Family all throughout and you get the hope that their plan fully works without complications.The ending of the movie has Ki-taek (the father of the Kim Family) killing the father of the Park Family and I was pretty much going \"Oh my god!\" which had my eyes wide open. It isn't too long until the final scene shows Ki-taek living in the Park Family bunker, hiding out from the police and the scene of Ki-woo writing to his hidden father is one that will make you question \"Will Ki-woo buy the house or not so that they can be reunited?\" It was a shame that we never saw Park Da-hye after her father's death and I kept hoping that she and Ki-woo will be back together in the future since they were amazing together.If you don't mind the movie being subtitled, go watch this amazing movie and you won't regret it.\n",
      "Love it, I watch this In march, and think, how they can do a movie with no mistake in anything?))\n",
      "Strongly recommended. Although need to follow subtitle in english as movie.\n",
      "Lets get straight into the point. From 1h02m to 1h42m is pure perfection of cinema. This 40min was so masterfully crafted that i dont think anyone else in movie history could have done it like Bong. Lets be honest some people just cant take in the metaphorical features of parasite and thats fine. It's actually okay if people feel it as overanalyzed. But you just can't deny the fact that 15 minutes of the ex-housemaid just tense the hell out of everybody. With that sneaky snitch part of Kiwoo family sneaking out of Parks house. Even if some do not see a meaning to this they were still got thrilled by. About the meaning, personally, i guest it's gonna be about the interpretation of one's self. For me, a Koreab masterpiece.\n",
      "Can be a bit strange if you only watch Disney movies (MCU included) and I'm seriously shoked that this movie doesn't have a higher rating.\n",
      "Creative good character development. The story moves well . not much else Tbh\n",
      "Not sure about it being the masterpiece that a lot of views claimed it to be, but it was nonetheless captivating to watch. Outrageous plot set in an everyday neighborhood made it seem not so ridiculous but rather interesting to watch. Great cinematography. Always Loved the director's style. And like many other good Asian films, this one definitely stands out from a crowd of CGI packed action Hollywood movies.\n",
      "As a Visual FX artist I am amazed to know that I was fooled in thinking that all the sets were practical when in reality alot was done in post-production. Amazing job on the visual side and an outstanding job for the overall story and acting.\n",
      "Give. 6 stars for the story and acting, but whats there in this movie that it gets an oskar and 8+ imdb. Some hot scenes , which are not even required. There are other movies which are for oscar and they gave it to this. This is really not acceptable.\n",
      "Not even able to digest, how they can get the jobs so easily.\n",
      "In the disguise of highlighting social inequality they just manage to show 2 extremes of society but in most cumbersome & blatant way. In fact the poor been shown as if to leach on the rich and live off (right from the title) no creativity or novelty in incidents or scenes. Characters are not at all introduced or given depth, everything is hurried throw. Climax is hotchpotch and forced upon. Much much over rated movie. Oscar ???\n",
      "This show is really really exquisite in terms of defining the privilege of upper class and the severity of being in the lower class. At the end of the movie, you would truly question your existence and the inevitable presence of modern society that we would be living in. This show really would pull you down to earth.\n",
      "Exposes the contrasts in society. Ive already watched the movie several times. A very well thought of story and a creative output!\n",
      "A entertaining story about a poor family taking over the rich family for their money because they are in lack of jobs, but it has its downfall that all hell breaks loose. The acting, story, dialogue, etc. Is superb in each and every way. In my opinion, I would definitely will watch it again.\n",
      "Thoroughly entertaining but also really interesting to analyse. This movie contains a variety of genre which makes it really entertaining and gripping. It starts out as a sort of mystery, thriller, comedy heist then goes to be a more dramatic, crime film. The film is an interesting representation of our society and contains a lot of symbols and important details crucial for this movie. Entertaining from beggining to end the film has no boring scenes despite it having not that much action scenes. Most of the scenes of the film remains in the dialogue and it's fascinating characters. Excellent writing in my opinion. A film to re watch.\n",
      "I give this movie a 10. The director need not make any more movies. They have created a masterpiece. Every single line of dialogue and action undertaken in this movie leads to its inevitable conclusion. There is not one thing out of place, much like the house in which much of the movie resides.The thing that stands out the most to me, are the dynamics of the families involved.We'll start with the rich family. They live idyllic. Everything is perfect in their world. Everything is in its place. The father works very hard for his money, he is home to be with his kids. But there's a problem. But we'll look at the poor family why.The poor family are thieves, con artists, morally reprehensible. They will deceive and cheat others within their vicinity. They will use whomever and whatever they can to get ahead and get something for themselves.But not once does any member of this family put the other one down. Never. They are completely and utterly supportive of one another. No one is blamed for things going wrong. No one is told they did not do things good enough for the family. Everyone is appreciated for what they bring to the table. They are congratulated when they succeed at a task. They are told how amazing they are at the skills they provide. There is so much love in this family for one another, it is nearly possible to look away from their actions towards anyone else. They are a lovable family. They would not turn their back on eachother in a heartbeat. They express thanks for the fortune and opportunities they have been provided, no matter how they came to them. They thought of the people they had undermined, and their fates.Go back to the rich family. The father is critical of the mother's housekeeping, cooking, general matriatchal skills. The mother is extremely impressionable and willing to cover up any discretion without a thought for the welfare of those affected. The sister criticises the younger brother for being a charlatan and fake. The brother shows open disrespect for his mother's commands and authority. He is showered with gifts rather than attention. They are willing to believe he is schizophrenic and prone to distraction than actually believe he \"saw a ghost\".This is why the poor family's father, when hearing the criticism's the rich family's father has about his wife asks him \"but you love her.\" Despite all her flaws that you have mentioned. Despite all your criticisms about her abilities in the kitchen and housekeeping skills. You still love her don't you. And you see that the rich man has to pause when delivering that answer. Does he?You can see in the poor family that they are eachother's biggest fans. Not one word of criticism for eachother is ever uttered. Apart from the mother stating the father would run like a cockroach if discovered. He pretends to be angry with her. He fools the children into thinking he would ever strike her with a fist or open hand. He laughs at them for ever believing such a thing could, would or should happen. And they all laugh together in the end at what the mother replies. This family loves eachother unconditionally. They support, applaud, congratulate and openly tell eachother \"I think you're amazing.\"But they are con artists and crooks. Thieves and liars to everyone else.And to get off for an evening the rich family's mother and father pretend to be \"the morally reprehensible\" for sexual kicks. Though they treat their help with respect, they find them beneath them as people. They find them dirty. And this gets them off sexually. Because that's what they really want to be, but they can't. Because they have surrounded themselves with everything that says they are supposed to be better. If they slip, if they fall, the facade will come crashing down. And it will show everyone else what they really are. No better than anyone else in the end. The same. And the poor family have a dignity and an integrity with one another that says they deserve the best of everything. But life has not worked out \"as planned.\"This movie is a masterpiece.\n",
      "Most of the time when my opinion does not jibe with the majority I am confident in my assessment. With this one I am not so sure for some reason. That being said I think it is ridiculously overrated. I just really did not find it to be anything special. I thought the Japanese movie shoplifters was infinitely better.\n",
      "Much has been said about this amorally elegant black comedy as full of twists and reversals as 'Volpone', yet few observers have commented upon the remarkable use of music; including the unexpected use of two arias from Handl's 'Rondelina' which add yet another veneer to the frantic proceedings and adroitly compliments the mise en scene.\n",
      "Although the image of the rich man seems too simple, the rhythm of the script, the language of the director's camera and the meaning and metaphor behind it are already impressive. As a commercial film, it is undoubtedly very good, but everything is so clear that you may lose the interest to watch it again.\n",
      "The film won four Academy Awards and received praise from so many critics, it had to great right. With its thinly disguised story line about class warfare, it's no wonder Hollywood embraced it. I watched it all the way through and when it was over I felt nothing. Didn't love it, didn't hate it and frankly as Im writing this, I really don't remember much about it\n",
      "Absolutely incredible movie it has a little bit of everything but it's the ultimate thriller. It slowly ramps up and never lets off until the final moments. Even if you aren't big on foreign films or subtitles just give this one a chance. It's as good as cinema has been in the last 50 years.\n",
      "We came late to the Parasite party, watching it a year after the brouhahah, and it does live up to the hype. Despite the universal praise the film received, I was somehow reluctant to watch it, but I am very glad I bit the bullet - the film was satisfying, informative, funny, sad and beautifully made. It's a film of three halves, part Roma, part French comedy of errors, part Shakespearean tragedy. The Roma elements introduced us to Korean culture which was a refreshing insight to lifestyles I knew nothing about. The comedy of errors elements are genuinely funny and very well scripted, with sass and wit and portrayed and directed with excellent timing. The tragedy is shocking but never out of kilter with the rest of the film (I'll say no more in case of spoilers, suffice to say, it somewhat vindicated my earlier reluctance to watch the film, but I am extremely glad I overcame that reluctance.). It is a 10 star film given 9 because, realistically, I doubt I will watch it again even though it is an excellent film.\n",
      "*Spoilers alert: Don't watch this review if you haven't seen the movie yet, and give recommendation of this film to all your friends in order to give more visibility about Korean cinema.\n",
      "This film tell us the story of Kevin, a young adult that lives in poverty with his family and is trying to improve his own life, as well as the ones of his family, by faking his own documents and getting a job into a rich family house as an english teacher.The really positive thing about this film is that It works perfectly as movie and film, due to the combination of black comedy, thriller, and even terror on the second and final act.\n",
      "This combination of different genres across the film with really good measure makes the film to be really entertaining, and at the same time artistically profound due to the cinematography and use of minimalistic environments and shots that creates a good atmosphere really quicklyI think this movie shows perfectly how we shouldn't believe in the american dream, because the higher amounts of drawbacks that we have against us, it is very likely that we aren't going to reach the \"dream\", and this is really obvious at the end of the movie.\n",
      "Whatever we think the americano dream is, we have to always remember to ourselves that is just a lie that leads to dissapointment and frustration rather happiness and prosperity.\n",
      "In resume, if you want to watch an independent film from last year that has a really good story, cinematography and acting, check this one out\n",
      "An interesting movie with complex social hierarchies portrayed without the classic tropes.Overall a very solid movie, but my personal take is this was the worst of Bong's movies.\n",
      "Its a nice movie.it showes the reality of two different world.korean movies and drams never disappoint always good entertainment. Definitely a MUST WATCH film from 2019, this Palme d'Or winner of Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint with it's hard hitting themes and exceptionally crafted story. Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going/Binge-watching such a joy. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.\n",
      "Never before have I seen a film that's funny, intelligent, nerve-wracking and thought-provoking at the same time. I wondered into the cinema not knowing what to expect; I left with an urgent desire to learn *everything* about Korean cinema. \"Parasite\" is a must-see.\n",
      "This movie fantastically describe about the financial gap between rich and poor people and their emotions their needs.\n",
      "This movie puts human nature on a pedestal and spins it until you are face to face with some of the most dark, bitter truths of society and our place. You will laugh, you will hide your eyes behind a decor couch pillow, and you will curse until you start to wonder: whose side am I really on? Who are the \"good guys\" in a world full of competition and ladders? Fantastic.\n",
      "I did enjoy this film and im not dissing it but it defo should not have won the oscar for best film in my opinion as i can name a couple that were much better films but if we all liked the same films it would be boring , saying that it is a good film good acting quite amusing and good story defo go watch if you get chance.....!!\n",
      "It's a good entertaining movie, but for me it was very predictable. For those who are not in touch with other cultures or poverty issue may find this movie very innovative, but it has long sequences that are very boring. But overall, if you are someone who watch movies regularly, you will find this very predictable.\n",
      "I wouldn't call it a \"masterpiece\".\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, the movie was good but the the way other reviews are saying like \"most thought provoking films\" is just wrong.\n",
      "Korean films are doing really well on International platform in this century, we saw how good films like BURNING and OLDBOY was and now it's PARASITE which has surpassed all of them in achieving the degree of how to grab the audience from the real world and put them in the virtual world which they ignore around them.\n",
      "Parasite is a story of below average income Korean family who really love eachother which is a characteristic feature of poor families. The love to exploit freebies whenever they can...they always use others' WiFi.\n",
      "The story takes a turn when one of their friends' visits their home and give them a kind of meteroid out of his grandfather's collection and tells that there is a need of english tuitor in a wealthy household. The family agrees to the contract even if they have make fake college degrees. The story will really make you engage once you will sit to watch this movie. There is no way you will be dissapointed by the story telling and characters.\n",
      "No wonder this movie won Palme d'or since it has stood the test of every variables which are involved in a perfect thriller.\n",
      "If you are movie fan...especially a foreign film lover then this movie is made for you...a must watch. Thanks.\n",
      "Dark comedy with a very natural plot. Somehow all the fraud shown could happen in real life.\n",
      "What gets me is my culture has certain similarity with Korean, perhaps it is asian curse.\n",
      "Actors are so deep in their roles. And well done directed. I even could sense the body scent issue, frowned at the social gap, the misery of faking our real life for others in the name of greater good.\n",
      "God, I laughed and swore at same time.\n",
      "100% recommend this movie to all my friends.\n",
      "This film has it all comedy, drama, horror and anything else you can squeeze out of it. It works really well. Four characters that literally take over another families life.\n",
      "I have to say, I am a big fan of this movie. I never thought that a show about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface would be my style. But this moive strikes where few other do, the lack of empathy from those in higher class is definitively similar in every culture, while there are a few \"fantastic\" moments the plot is extremely relatable and to a certain extent, you can feel empathy in almost all the characters (except maybe for the rich house owners).Parasite is fantasticly awesome and can definitively engage and entertain me. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys a drama filled psychological thriller.\n",
      "Art, music, completion and drama conflict are all wonderful and impeccable. This play is a carefully crafted work of art, but I don't particularly like it emotionally. The problem is that in order to improve the plot closed-loop, it has set up a lot of slightly deliberate contradictions and coincidences, too straightforward metaphors, and it lacks a natural result, so it also slightly reduces the strength of tragedy.\n",
      "Dark, spot-on culturally aware satire, so funny; SO funny!\n",
      "And here it is better to mention the role of blindfolds on the eyes of characters who are not able to see the character or anything but the idea they want to get and try to get that position for themselves in any way and by trickery. And human beings who want to achieve something that is not for them by trickery may destroy them. (People who do not understand seeing anything other than their own happiness, even tolerating another human body odor that needs help) The stone, which was a symbol of happiness for the boy, destroyed him and shows how ugly wealth can be and to get What should we do to be able to get it?\n",
      "Inventive story, fair enough, great metaphors, obviously, but unfortunately, terrible acting. \"Mrs Park\" perhaps an exception, to the all round, wooden dourness of the performances. Was looking forward to seeing this, especially as it had been likened to \"Society\" the veritable 80's cult classic masterpiece, but I was left feeling well, pretty underwhelmed really, but hey, ho you can't have everything. However, maybe it'll grow on me over time!\n",
      "I didnt get carried away it was a brilliantly crafted film showing the haves as a bit dense and the have not far more clever but because they had to be. It had brilliant twists and turns and deserves all the accolades. But best film. No. Films that should get best film are those you should visit a cinema for get the whole experience. Parasite will be remarkable on DVD which some films lose that cinematic experience that's why I don't rate it as 10 but that's me and I respect those that think otherwise.\n",
      "It was not bad, but honestly I don't understand how this movie can get a single 10 star review from some people. This movie is simply overrated.\n",
      "I went into this this film only knowing the premise. An unemployed family worm their way into getting jobs in a wealthy families home. This film starts off fun and it is very satarical, it then takes a very dark turn. The direction is amazing and dialogue is very funny and twisted. The acting is top notch, but the real star of this film is the Korean director, he wrote directed and produced this film. The music and compasitions of scenes are so well thought out. You really didn't know what was coming next. That is so refreshing and exciting as a film goer. This is a really strong commentary on the class system and what you would do if your deseperate to live the high life. Its hard to review this film without giving too much away. I will say be warned the violence is not for the faint heart hearted. If you love to be entertained and watch something different this is for you. This film will not be forgotten come Oscar season. A masterpiece of cinema, 4.5 stars\n",
      "Boon Jong ho's parasite is a slow burner 2hr film telling a story about two families (actually3) whose lives gets entangled within a house. Although the last half hour movie do make out of the lost time initially where the story takes some time for the build up.\n",
      "The mansion has a special eerie feel throughout the film and you will know why it feels like that later on. The background score supports the eerieness. I watched the film in Korean language using eng subtitles edited by a Korean guy who knew only handful of English. So there were scenes where I had to literally assume what had happened by looking at the frame alone.\n",
      "Overall you won't regret watching parasite ,infact it's a must watch for people who likes seeing unpredictable films\n",
      "From smart comedy to a violent drama in the best way I ever seen, from now on I will start taking Korean movies as serious as I ever did before, there is no way you gonna hate this peace of art\n",
      "Sure Parasite it's an original, well directed, and captivating movie, but it's not the masterpiece of this decade. I guess Sam Mendez has been quite deceived not receiving the best picture with 1917 instead of this movie.\n",
      "As the plot progresses, the differences between the two families become more apparent and the concept of \"parasite\" becomes more acute.Bong joon-ho's genre films are remarkably transparent, part modern fable and part family drama from a distance, while up close they oscillate between satire, dark comedy and thriller, deftly managing transitions and shifts in style.Uzan's big house has played a huge role in spatial design and vertical positioning -- highlighting the upper and lower classes of society.The use of stair, window, insect, rainwater, sewage also is very advanced.As the name suggests, bong joon-ho once again proves that genre films are real movies, and that popularity is closely related to the author.\n",
      "Do understand the message and all but definitely not worth winning the oscars. The mindset depicted is something which some people have and not all. For me this was one of the most overrated Oscar winner ever.\n",
      "I liked this movie. Actually, when i first heard it's a joint collaboration of Joon-ho Bong and Kang-ho Song, again, it was a must watch. And then, I was observed with the film's roll once I started watching it. How climax crawled from a creepy space to reveal itself was fabulous.The film shows a slum family with obvious big dreams from all its family members while a totally opposite side of hyper rich family with lost kids and bizarre wife. Film showcases smooth turns and in a real well crafted way of how those Four family members occupy their positions in new Employer's house within few days. Apparently, things all go well until an unexpected situation turmoils everything. Story, I would say, did ended OK. Maybe I expected something more out of it but that's OK.Now, why come 8/10. Their are a couple of glitches which apparently din't convinced me. Like for example:Why wasn't a single scrutiny done of the remaining fellows other than Kevin. He gave so good impression through his way of teaching Da-song that everything was cool after. I would have appreciated more if some more work was done. Like before hiring a new employee, his/her SSN or some other proof submission is atleast required. Ya, they could forger those proves too, but again, did they? I think people in today's world, especially Rich, are more superstitious and overcautious. Wouldn't they want anything like that or atleast give a hunch to get some background check? Or their friends could have opened their eyes.Once Kevin gets recruited within a few days, like within a wink of your eye, all the other problems in old workers start forthcoming. A nanny cum maid working from 4 years never showed a single sign of TB in her whole stay and all of a sudden, she started Coughing and splitting blood. Again, I won't say its not impossible but i wasn't much getting into it. Means, isn't the onus on me to alteast listen her up?Those two above points were thin thread, if broken, the whole climax is gone into toss. Anyways, above expectations for Director's creative work, cinematography, chilling thrill and a different aspect of story.\n",
      "Theme is nothing new, a topic of gap between rich and poor ones, which an social issue we hear everyday. But on top of the theme, the story aims at showing the dark side of the human being, no matter poor or rich are also dark. I like the every single little details described such as the master annoyed by the smell of driver. It's so vivid. The story end well without too much fuzzy parts. The director nail it by showing a serious theme but in an very entertaining way. Awesome movie!\n",
      "This movie is really great korean movie with great cast and just idea for this movie is unique and it is one of best foreign movies out there\n",
      "I wonder if this movie/story would've gotten an Oscar if it was made in Hollywood and in English.\n",
      "Surely had it been done in Hollywood it would've been just another well made thriller drama movie / very \"Talented Mr. Ripley\" like.Don't get me wrong, it's a very well done and interesting film with a strong agenda. But imo should've been just a Foreign language award.\n",
      "Perhaps there were no stronger candidates this year from Hollywood that show life. And Parasite showed life and disparity in life really well.\n",
      "Put any country as a setting for this film and the story would still stick.\n",
      "Objectively speaking, this film is not as good as \"Memories of Murder\"and \"Mother\". It is a good movie. But I have to say that if \"Burning\" is in Cannes this year, \"Parasite\" may not win the prize. This is the kind of movie that you think is good after watching it, but you are not interested in watching it again. Bong Joon-ho is a master of genre, but this movie obviously cannot be his best.\n",
      "I'm not a fan of subtitles, so I was a little apprehensive, but knowing it had won an Oscar, I had to give it a go. Half way in, I was gripped. Some very interesting plot twists to keep you on your toes. I'd say it was 20 minutes or so too long, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.\n",
      "One of the best of the decade, Cinematography is priceless, screenplay is top-notch.\n",
      "one of the best stories about poverty-wealth complex I've ever seen.\n",
      "you're experiencing two stories and two completely different movies until half-way as you're watching the poor family planning their way through the other life and it connects together in the best way possible,\n",
      "since the basement is found, you enter another world of twist and mystery which messes with your mind and gets you on another journey.all I can say is,\n",
      "ABSOLUTE GOLD!\n",
      "The story telling, and general themes of the movie work and are worth its praise. However, I don't see how it won best picture with other aspects such as cinematography being good, through not amazing.The movie is enjoyable, though not for everyone. There are some light comedic moments, introspective reflections, and evening some thriller surprises. The movie works, but I can't say it was the best picture I saw from 2019.\n",
      "The stupidest movie I've ever seen. I'm really sorry for those who voted for this junk movie.\n",
      "The movie was great and I would love to watch it again but what bothered me later is how the dogs in the house never noticed the presence of another human being like in the case of the boy when he hides under the bed.\n",
      "The manner which the story is being told here, combined with some very intriguing characters, make this one of the best movies of the year. A lot about this film is very well done, from the acting to the shot composition. I also love the social commentary undertones. The ending is a bit unnecessarily violent, but overall this is a very good movie I would say.\n",
      "**Spoiler alert**Winning an Oscar despite being a foreign language film is remarkable. Inspired by the Oscar win and the surrounding publicity if you watch the trailer, it will intrigue you enough to feel an urgency for watching the movie.That this is a class war movie will be evident by then. That there is a parasite central to the story is implied too but who preys on whom is still subject to interpretation or is at least a twisted discovery you make as the story unravels.There is a rich family, gullible & nice but also self-centered and afflicted with class divide enough to dominate everyday decisions in their high-ground lives.\n",
      "There is a poor family struggling for food and shelter in their below the ground apartment life and yet reveling in their laziness and short term merry making of whatever bounty they can get from odd jobs.When an opportunity comes knocking, promising an easy way of pulling them out of their pit, they pursue it full throttle morality and legalities be damned.\n",
      "The momentum of their success builds up for a while and descend begins as they encounter a secret and fraud of another kind threatening their new found prosperity.As they discover people like themselves who have stakes in uncovering their frauds, they have to win the fight to not slip back to their below the ground existence. The unfolding of surrounding events also leads to a realization that the idea of their affluence is also just a mirage. After all the stench of the basement remains in them and rich people will forever pinch their nose in disgust as their stench wafts through the rich people's perfumed houses.There is a moment of irony too when a few hours after they had savored the rainfall as they lay usurping the living room of their bosses and pretending that they belonged their after all, they realize that unknown to them the same heavy rain had filled up their basement house with dirty sewer water, destroying their belongings and rendering them homeless in real life.\n",
      "The pretense of being rich as a part of their rich bosses life suddenly becomes exhausting and together with the chaos of meeting their possible nemesis shocks them out of their reveries of affluence, shatters all their future planning and leads to a complete meltdown a day later.The final scene plays out amidst an ominous setting. The feeling about an impending tragedy is strong. It still manages to be darkly-funny as Geun-Sey plays out his murderous streak with a comical frenzy.The movie won an Oscar for original screenplay and is as much a masterpiece as implied by that accolade. It talks literally and metaphorically about the chasms in the society and leaves the viewers to decide if there are any heroes or villains at all.The movie shows self-imposed helplessness that poverty brings along, how the urge to come out of its grips fast and easy often pushes people further in to its throes. That the need for escapism is so strong that precious reality is lost and often the only way out through education, a steady job is completely lost.Ki-Woo often promises himself and others about the rightful things he will do and achieve, but often leaves it to a later day. At present he is too busy forging the documents, fencing off his day to day struggles or later, longing for the good days that happened, and this is likely to be his way of life throughout in the absence of any supportive surrounding.That is also how the movie ends, with a promise by him which he is sure to never fulfill and so the longing, the aspirations, the needs will remain along with the helplessness of never quiet achieving them.The parasite in the meantime could either be the one who had resigned to an underground life living off the bounty stolen from his rich savior as long as he lived, or the one who is still alive and hiding in the same underground hell albeit with a hope of one day coming out of it.\n",
      "Or it could be both of them or all the poor men in a hurry to attach their woeful life to those better off around them and be like parasites by the awful choices they make or maybe as a natural order of things or a bit of both.\n",
      "What can I say... just Perfect!Enjoyed every aspect of this masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. From the plot, directing, setting, cinematography, sound effects, and acting.This movie is clear, engaging, and keeps you thinking of what could happen next. Which is not what you ever expected.First, it starts out by laying out the foundation of the family, their financial situation and personalities. The apartment not even in ground floor. Later comes the Rock which is the curse and the blessing in my opinion. Gave them the opportunities and then chaos.Second the parallel, the other family, a community and class very different than theirs. From being jobless to them all employed in this house. They are servants in a family that is a naive high class family who clearly due to their financial situation, are very very naive. However, due to the financial gain, they try desperately not to lose their jobs.After that, their personalities change, especially as the father is disgusted by the upper class view and nativity. Every character at this point has his own views that changed. After that the hidden basement occurred and CHAOS!.The story doesn't just keep you hanging, the ending is amazing too. The climax which gets out of control and then the family reunites in the same house.Something I noticed which made me admire this movie is the directing and cinematography. Every single shot and angle is thought of, truly an art. All actors were exceptional. Especially the transform in their personalities. The music was astounding, it made me feel more engaged.This movie is nothing short than a masterpiece. Truly enjoyable.\n",
      "I tried going into this movie with as little information as possible, and I'm glad I did. The title definitely threw me off, thinking that it was a horror of some sort. Turns out it had a lot of comedy and drama. Great characters and very original. I wasn't a huge fan of the way it ended, it felt like a bit more time could have made a difference, but overall I think it deserved a lot of the awards it got.\n",
      "When this movie got the Oscar, I was surprised to see that Oscars panel has finally accepted other language films. Most of the old Oscar winners were nothing more than boring, documentary-like movies which I hated. This time, I thought of checking out the movie and I was taken aback by the masterful direction and screenplay of a very simple story line. The script is the key and the way the visuals are shown is mind-blowing. The inequality among people, rich and poor, is shown so subtly which is the strong point of the film. At first, you want the bad family to go down but when you look at the way they live, the way the head of the park family treat the head of the poor family, somewhere you feel what they are doing is justified. And the final scene when park cares only about his fainted son instead of the stabbed victims shows the selfishness he has and it doesn't seem so wrong after all. Brilliant narration and absolutely must watch for people who like good movies!\n",
      "This is certainly unique. It's strong points are excellent central performances from the ensemble cast and some good laughs in the first half. It's stylishly done, but ultimately it's a tad too silly and has a fairly bitter taste that isn't for me. If you like dark comedy though it may be for you.\n",
      "In the beginning the film was a bit strange (black humor). But I didn't find that disturbing at all. I cannot summarize the film, because otherwise I would betray the whole film. The film was just very, very well made and there is also a lot of humor in the film.\n",
      "I don't want to say too much to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that I have seen lots of films and this one had me at the edge of my seat with my jaw on the floor for most of the movie! I hope you get to see it\n",
      "This movie was amazing: great acting , unique plot, many symbols and hidden messages, suspense and action. Definitely a 10/10 for me. The cleverness (or slyness) of the poor family was portrayed perfectly in contrast to the gullible manner of the rich family. The movie climax was amazing and the ending leaves the audience thinking.\n",
      "Never watched anything quite like it. The story was awesome. I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little confusing. Maybe I missed something. I didn't understand why the father flipped out. Still thought it was a witty clever movie. Check it out.\n",
      "I have never watched a korean movie before, but this one is on different level. But it could be more extraordinary if it has a dubbed version its really hard to watch it with subtitles. Ill recommend to wait for a dubbed version for whose going to watch it.\n",
      "So Parasite is good but certainly not a mega masterpiece. Something special, indeed, but don't expect too much. One can also interpret more than possible.In terms of cinematography its rather average. good storytelling. good acting.The movie has special moments, impacts that you dont expect. All in all, the socially critical background makes it special for me.\n",
      "This is one of those movies that after watching you have to step back for a second and breathe. Amazing. Great acting, directing, and genius writing. Beautiful set design and a perfect score. And that peach montage I mean, just watch this movie. If I have one complaint the ending could've been a little tighter, but it's a minor issue. Incredible, deserved every award.\n",
      "A very unique and incredibly well directed film. Some of the translation doesn't work incredibly well, but I can't learn Korean to watch a film. Really love the thought of 'what/who is the real parasite'. That can leave you thinking a long time.\n",
      "I have to give this movie lots of praise for it's cinematography, the brilliant editing, the fantastic performances from everyone, the themes are complex and delicious, deception, greed, power, ignorance and tragedy. The film is really well paced and holds your attention right from the start, it gradually builds and builds and things really do explode at the end. The film is about two parallel families one very rich the other literally living below the poverty line. It does make you wonder how such a skilled and cunning family could all actually be unemployed but that is what we open with. The film only really has a couple of locations but it never feels low budget and in some ways it's really stunning. The film know asks us to believe something that really stretches your credulity and this unfortunately becomes a very important plot point. Other little details don't quite feel right, such as a hyperactive boy sleeping until midday for his own party. The dialogue is fast but you can follow it with subtitles, my favourite scene though features no dialogue at all really but is rather a journey through a storm which is just beautiful the use of music and sparks and lights and water. Parasite is a dark comedy I think but the tone is a little bit all over the place, I laughed a lot but other parts don't seem to be comedic but pretty serious. The cast deserve special praise, every character is just perfectly portrayed. Whether or not you buy the ending is going to be up to the individual. I came out of the cinema pretty much floored by this film, but after another viewing some of the logical problems do start to niggle you. I appreciate this film though as something a bit special.\n",
      "I was disappointed with the movie after the reviews. Seemed unrealistic and I didn't find the morale of the story. I read how you can see Mr. Park's view of the \"help\" can be perceived as seeing the \"help\" as lesser human beings, but with the absurd ness of the story it questions Mr. Parks integrity as a character. It was a silly heist with a silly ending, none of it being likely and I didn't learn anything. The poor family stepped on other poor people to get ahead and even murdered a women, then the husband of that women comes after them. People kill people and it all seems ridiculous.\n",
      "I kept waiting for something to happen...wow, really? Someone living in the basement? That was the big reveal? You didn't need two hours to drive home the point that rich people think they are better than middle or low class. It was a two hour long snooze-fest, you should have just made the title \"eat the rich\". It would have saved us all time.\n",
      "The best Asian movie of the decade. It touches the most sensitive and delicate aspects of society and extents human behavior could possibly reach. With all that, it weaves a storyline which keep the audience engulfed throughout 120 mins and 4 distinct genres. I personally have not seen a smoothly navigated movie as Parasite which gives the audience the feeling of the plot frame by frame. Remarkable script, direction, acting and camera.\n",
      "I liked the movie, but it's not the best of 2019 !!!\n",
      "In my opinion 1917 should have won the Oscar for best film.\n",
      "But this is a good and interesting film.\n",
      "It's Korean movie , based on survival of poor family on one rich and dumb businessman. It starts with tutor who belongs to poor family and smartly he makes the room for other family members as well in rich family. Movie gets Dramatic turn when old maid came to know that these all tutor driver belongs to same family when owner went on vacation. 1st half is quite good and full of presense of mind and tricks, 2nd half turned violent . If you expect some happy ending kind stuff then The parasite will not for you.\n",
      "For me, Oldboy is still the best South-Korean movie, but this movie shows us that not only movies from the 'west' are worth to watch. Wow what a movie is this one. A good storyline, great acting, a scene which tarantino would be proud of and a clear and good message! Well done!\n",
      "I'm not usually a fan of Korean movies, but this one got me very interested from the very beginning, it's not the first time a movie makes us root for someone even though they're not necessarily doing the right thing, but it makes us question once again, what is the right thing? I really loved the representation of society in this one, it shows a whole different side.. even though the family was very poor they still had energy and were clever enough to actually go out and try and change it.\n",
      "The movie was dramatic, funny, scary in all the right ways.\n",
      "I liked this movie for being very deep and complicated in story, while not being so much unclear. It just explains us realistic and possible real life complicated situations. Emotional, funny, realistic, serious, religious, moral, teaching, but negative. Also interesting insight into Korean culture and behavior. The only thing that makes this movie bad is that it is too negative, and especially negative ending. Teaches us about instability of life, greed, desperation, survival, crime. Worth an oscar at least because of its depth or because of seriousness of topics or lessons. Not good to watch for those sensitive to scary and difficult realistic situations like getting hurt, imprisoned, etc.\n",
      "I would have thought that parasite might have been overhyped like the reviews were telling me, particularly after the best picture win, but somehow it managed to overcome all that. What a brilliant vision Bong Joon Ho has, his sly socio economic commentary mixed in with humour, thriller and tragedy. This film feels almost impenetrable, because it's so well crafted and held together, masterfully created from a technical standpoint but it's refreshingly accessible to pretty much any audience. I don't like using the word masterpiece a lot, but in my mind, this is one of them. Films like Parasite remind me of why I love films. Absolutely recommend.\n",
      "I was really impressed by the direction, no doubt and few other aspects of the movie but certainly not worth of Oscar. Just a normal movie which was going good until everything went beyond reality and started going haywire. Would have been much better if it have kept the thrilling story of their play in other difficult situations without being all gory at the end! Overall good till 1:30 hrs. Later it's just not amazing. Too much overrated. Don't know why they don't consider other masterpieces coming from third world countries.\n",
      "I am not sure about the Korean values, but this movie is a silly adaptation of rags to riches where stereotypes are very strong and the plot is very flimsy. A lot of disgusting scenes including violence, gross and unnecessary. A dark comedy but the darkness outweighs the entertainment. I have seen much better foreign movies but at the least it was interesting to see some Korea other than Samsung, LG, Kia or Hyundai.\n",
      "Instead of talking about the individual positive aspects of this movie, I'm just gonna say that this an excellent movie and will point out a few things that I personally did not enjoy. The main one being; all of the events feeling ridiculously coincidental. Another one is; -still under the coincidentiality umbrella but with a slight twist- a common issue that I tend to realize in above-average-budgeted international movies. They sometimes want to tell too many things when they didn't really need to, which ends up muddying up the overall balance of the main story.An unemployed family of 4 infiltrate into a rich family's household.\n",
      "This fascinating South Korean film starts with a poor family scheming to get jobs with a rich family but eventually becomes something much darker and weirder. A very pointed exploration of the class/wealth divide, the movie is not just about personal tragedy but about societal tragedy.At the same time, it's also at times quite funny and exciting, and it's beautifully shot and acted.Thought-provoking and compelling, it's that rare movie that actually deserved all the awards it won.\n",
      "Movie was pretty good. From the camera angles to acting, everything felt so natural to me. It was like watching professionals creating something smooth to feel inside. I personally found a plot hole but it doesn't affect my opinion towards to movie.\n",
      "This movie has a little bit for everyone that I think makes this a good watch for anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. Personally, I actually enjoy using subtitles but my friends who don't regularly like them and were skeptical about watching a foreign film loved it as well. It's satirical, dark, at times it is heartbreaking, and at others it is thrilling. This movie works in key details like a magician doing a trick right under your nose. We still must give this film time to age but I must say that in my opinion it is one of the best films of the definitely past few years. The one thing that holds back this movie is an ending that isn't bad but leaves a bit to be desired.\n",
      "Parasite movie has its elements of comedy , drama and thrilling but not satisfying at the end because\n",
      "It takes a dark turn at the end which was still nice if the production was going to end that way ...\n",
      "But No\n",
      "It takes another dark turn which was in my opinion bad and I disliked it because you can messed up a great movie by ruining its ending\n",
      "Many people liked it and also decided to give this movie an academy award for best picture\n",
      "But nah.. I didn't get it..\n",
      "So good movie to watch but at the end it gets too depressing to watch the ending\n",
      "No justice done there.\n",
      "When I look at a movie as a whole I'm more focused on story then execution first, and am always pleased when the films execution is excellent too, like this film. I went into this movie with very low expectations because it seemed confused and I wasn't convinced the thriller part of the film would work because I set a pretty high bar there. I also never give out 10's because a project can always be improved. In this case, it reached at something instinctual that has only happened a few times, where at the end of a film or book, I immediately, almost impulsively want to experience it again.Parasite succeeds in a big way for a couple of really important reasons. The intelligent wit and comedy of the film draws out great empathy from the viewer without them even realizing it, and brings you along just enough to be fully invested in the characters. The family is relatable, poor, and have their sense of humor and love for each other that has great reach for those watching. As things take a dark turn into its thriller act, the transition is natural and a part of you wants that playful interaction to come back, but as things unfold you know there isn't a turning point and that it's about to get worse before it gets better. At this point in the film, the meaningful narrative on wealth inequality and its impacts quickly take a full cast you enjoy together and almost seems to divide them against each other. By the end of the film, you've been fully primed for the message and will probably feel a bit torn towards the protagonists and plot as a whole. That feeling is coming from the reality so many have experienced, and for it's masterful strokes I found myself completely hooked.There isn't a single negative I can think of with this film. From direction to acting, costuming and screenwriting, this film was highly intelligent and used genre as a way to paint new aspects of the story rather than relying on tropes or frameworks within a single genre. The changes from comedy to tragedy itself compels the narrative and that achievement alone makes this an excellent film!\n",
      "This is a nice movie to watch.. All the twists and turns makes the movie really interesting. Actors were all very good.It's just I felt the movie losts it's pace now and then. It gets boring in the middle.But then what an ending.\n",
      "I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I didn't read too much about it, but watching the trailer and having seen this director's previous work 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', I was expecting something in the horror/sci-fi genre. But that's not what this movie was.\n",
      "Sadly, whatever message the director Joon Ho Bong was trying to convey, it was lost in the tonally uneven mess of a script and direction, that starts off as a light hearted comedy, but then drags down into a dark and depressing disaster.\n",
      "When the movie starts, we are shown a working class (more more like poor) family, the Kims, who seem to be hard on their luck. We see they work together folding pizza boxes (i don't see how the fumigated boxes were still good), to earn a few bucks.\n",
      "Anyway, luck falls upon them when a friend of their son hooks him up with a sweet tutoring gig at the home of the Parks. And as the movie progresses, the members of the Kim family slowly insert themselves into aspects of the Parks lives.\n",
      "Now, I think the intention was to portray this as some sort of social commentary and class struggle. But it definitely doesn't come across like this at all. All we see is The Kim family using tricks and deception to get their way, while the wealthy Park family, while a little naive, is portrayed as actually fairly nice. They don't mistreat any of their workers, they don't even do background checks on the Kim family (who are masquerading as non-related individuals). The father seems to be hard working, but is willing to take time off, along with the whole family, to take the young son out camping for his birthday.\n",
      "The movie then takes a dark turn when we find out the husband of the previous maid was living in the basement of the home. Not as a prisoner, but of his own choice, to evade the law. Now, this turn of events is NOT a twist. I was expecting the twist to be more like it turns out the original architect/owner was locked down there, and the Park family was also a bunch of imposters.\n",
      "Anyway, this movie devolves into scenes of violence where the Park father is killed, and really, I don't get why he had to die. His only crime was he didn't like a particular smell. It wasn't a metaphor for poor people, because poor people probably don't like smelly people either. It just seemed like the whole basement bunker/garden bloodbath was shoehorned in for the little 'twist' ending where we see the lights flickering on and off in the house because that's where the murderous Kim father chose to hide.\n",
      "The whole movie premise was just bad, one dimensional characters who we never learn anything about, so we don't feel any sympathy, except maybe for the Park family who were too nice for their own good.\n",
      "This movie really doesn't deserve the high praise it's been getting. It's a clumsy effort that doesn't execute it's themes very well. I just gave it a 3 because it's pretty to look at and some of the dialogue was funny. But as a whole, it's an unrewarding experience to sit through.\n",
      "Like I Said, Parasite Is A Term Which Is Very Sincere . The Way Our World Has Build Up Is Constantly Changing Our Way Of Living, Our Seeing & Most Importantly Our Thinking.This Movie Is Basically Based On A True Fact Of Society. The Way The Director Portrayed This Whole Story With An Amazing Cinematography Is Simply Amazing.Haven't Seen It Yet?? Do Watch First.\n",
      "Without spoiling anything, I'll say that this movie cannot just be watched. It has to be felt. The characters are all relatable in a very discomforting way, which is what makes this movie so intensely sad and beautiful. A great peek into an economic struggles that is often left unseen but might now be more relevant than ever.\n",
      "I starting off a tad bored watching this movie. I really could not understand where this would go. Some plot points felt unnatural and just to introduce the plot.However, the last half of this movie is truly special. The increidble cinematgraphy shines and a suspesnf moment quickly turns chaotic and then quickly heartwarming. This movie truly has it all.Additionally, there is great social commentary on the rich family poor family dynamic. The poor families battle for a living with each other and anger driven from their situation spills over to the rich people.. The full meanjng of this I do not understand but I found it leaving me with much to think about.Much recommended.\n",
      "After only 5 minutes of watching this film you will be fully immersed into an unknown world (at least for outsiders of korean life) and thrown into a tale full of intrigue, wit, laughter and shock. All of this backed up with a smart plot and story twists at every turn ensuring the audience is kept on their toes at all time.There may be only but a few grey areas of the story that you feel a loss of understanding but that feeling quickly subsides as the next page of the story quickly unfolds.Great director and great film 9/10\n",
      "Just one thing to say amazing. Story is so normal but you dont understand this movie when you see it cuz its a one kind of metaphor movie.\n",
      "The movie itself isn't too bad. It's worth watching if you want something different from what you're used to watching. The story-line is good, it really makes you pay attention on little things, but it's also too simple.Acting was amazing, but I didn't like the directing. Maybe it was just directed in a unique way that not everyone will find its true value, but for me it was boring. In my personal opinion, this movie is kinda overrated.\n",
      "I saw this movie about a year ago when it came out in cinemas and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I think its a bit overrated but its still good and enjoyable. I would recommend people see this if they have not already.\n",
      "This is a wonderful film ruined by its last half hour including very graphic violence.Even if the plot required violence in the finale, it could have been done in a less graphic manner.Parasite, despite its successes in black humor, social criticism, music, photography, script and acting it falls victim to the \"culture of violence\" in cinema.\n",
      "It's a true masterpiece. Outstanding! May be the best movie of the decade. Amazing story, amazing screenplay,outstanding cinematography, beautiful music or sound, super acting. Overall it is one of best in history. And Bong Joon-ho is a legend.\n",
      "This movie is so relatable if you belong to a middle class family with unexpected ending. I felt connected and engaged with alot of characters in the movie. There are alot of scenes which were so true about high class society people. I love watching foreign language movies having a lit of different topics and real life struggles. This was actually an original dark comedy about class struggles. Please do try to watch award winning shows and movies which contain sensitive topics and real life struggles...Here I am trying to convince you guys to watch PARASITE and thank me later. You will love this film.\n",
      "Everything about this film has pretty much already been said. However since I've seen it, I've never been able enjoy sitting in my warm house during a rain storm since. And that's an example of how powerful cinema can show you something so blaringly obvious and change you. I also have a recurring nightmare about a man on the stairs but that's a different way this film affected me! Yikes!\n",
      "The first foreign Academy award-winning movie to earn Best Picture!!!!!!\n",
      "The movie I have chosen to review is \"Parasite\" by director Bong Joon-ho. I have decided to review this movie because not only is it rather thought-provoking the way Bong Joon-ho can mix comedy and thriller makes it even more compelling.\"Parasite\" is a film about greed and class and how a low-income family has managed to slyly finagle their way into working for a wealthy upper-class family. The Kim clan (the low-income family) manages to cunningly secure jobs for each family member by undermining the previous personal staff members of the wealthy Park family. However, while the Kims start integrating into the staff positions of the Parks, the film begins to turn toward thriller.The sudden tonal shift in the second half of the film might seem jarring to some, but personally for me, it helped drive home what Bong Joon-ho was trying to accomplish. He wanted to show the clear class divide between the Parks and Kims and did it masterfully throughout the film, which helps culminate in the final act's thrilling conclusion. How he subtly peppered in the Parks' casual disdain by having the father constantly bring up a stench or how something smelled terrible. The constant insistence of something smelling sets up a crucial moment during the final parts of the movie.Another thing I enjoyed was the Kims' scholar rock or suseok. I don't know if it was intentional, but the rock only seemed heavy when the Kims' used it because they believed it was worth something. I think this because when the Kims' house is flooded, the rock floats, but when the son carries it down the stairs, it seems heavy. To the Kims, the rock is a symbol of wealth and future fortune, but because of the society that they live in, it is a hollow dream that cannot be fulfilled due to class discrimination and the idea that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.The lesson I learned from this film is that under capitalism, it is nearly impossible to climb your way out of poverty, and no matter how cunning or intelligent you are, someone far less competent who was born into money will always have that money.This film could be enjoyable for everyone, although I don't know how many would be willing to watch it because it is a Korean film. However, I don't think language should stop someone from consuming good media. Parasite is a fantastic film that I hope everyone willing to watch will watch it!9 out of 10 stars cause it freaked me out at that stairs bit.\n",
      "The movie is well conducted and deserves the cannne nomination, the accesories the choice of actors, all the visuals and sounds create the story telling style of the movie , hats off for the director , the DOP and all the crew.\n",
      "As far as I know people in South Korea do not have that kind of openspoken relationship, using swearwords and sexual language.\n",
      "All in all it's an ok movie but as said not very realistic even for being a filmed drama/comedy/thriller.Do NOT understand the hype.\n",
      "With Parasite, Bong Joon Ho once again proves that he is a master of social commentary in cinema. Eventhough he has tackled several socially relevant themes in his previous movies, particularly in Snowpiercer, it hasn't been as immaculate as his work on Parasite. With a masterfully written screenplay and flawless direction, Bong has created a cleverly constructed critique on the class divisions of our society.The true genius of the film lies in its subtlety. Instead of presenting the themes in an on the nose manner, the film utilizes several symbols and metaphors using the characters, as well as the impeccable production design and blocking, both of which was aided by an exceptional screenplay and one of the best usages of storyboarding in cinema. The film conveys its themes entirely through these aspects with little to no reliance on exposition. The theme of wealth inequality is presented through the lives of two families who are at the two extreme ends of the financial spectrum and the parasitic relationship that occurs between them. One of the most notable achievements of the production design is the portrayal of the localities of the two families. The Kim family lives in a congested, cluttered, stink bug infested, frequently flooded semi-basement house in the lower regions of the city, relying on cheap food, surrounded by crammed up houses of similar conditions. On the other hand, the wealthy Park family lives in a modernistic, spacious, well-organized house with expensive possessions, in a beautiful neighborhood, in the upper regions of the city. The best visual representation of this can be seen in the sequence where Ki-woo walks up to the Park family house. A cleverly placed edit, suddenly transitions the gloomy, congested alleyway of the slum, to the sunlit, spacious driveway of the Park house. Another example of the brilliance of the production design is the subtle portrayal of the increasing wealth of the Kims. The cheap possessions seen in the house of the Kim family in the earlier scenes are gradually replaced by more expensive objects in the subsequent scenes.The movie showcases how the existing class divide in our society, forces a parasitic relationship between the upper and the lower class. This is best expressed through the infiltration of the Park house by the Kim family, followed by them existing almost as parasites on the Park family. This parasitic existence makes them temporarily rise above their hardships. This is evident from the sequence where they finally manage to chase away the drunkard who constantly urinates near their doorstep, symbolizing them standing up against the pathetic living conditions that have been plaguing them for years. However, the wealthy also live as parasites on the poor, as seen by how the Parks utilizes the Kims for their needs.Another aspect the movie addresses is the competition which occurs among the members of the lower class, which is a direct result of parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor. This is presented by the conflict that occurs between the Kims and the housekeeper and her husband. Both families who live as parasites on the Parks eventually discover each other, and engage in a bitter conflict with one another, to claim their place as the \"parasite\". This internal competition within the lower class, results in their own downfall, as the ensuing conflict results in them ending up in a much worse situation than before. An attempt to change this, will ultimately result in the downfall of the society as a whole, since the modern society is built on the existence of class divisions. This is symbolized by the climatic birthday party sequence where all the three focal families suffer fatal casualties. This results in the Kim family finding themselves in a much worse spot than they already were at the beginning of the film, which is the eventual outcome of the internal conflict for power which occurs among the lower class.The film also showcases how both the classes are affected differently by the same events. This is most evident by how differently both the families are affected by heavy rain. The Kims' lives are nearly destroyed by the flood, while the Parks view the rain as a mild inconvenience as their camping trip had to be canceled. While Ki-Tiek grieves the loss imposed on him by the rain, Mrs Park gleefully talks about how the rain had reduced the pollution and freshened the air.The film also deals with the destructive nature of false hope, symbolized by the Scholar's rock which Ki-woo receives from his friend. The rock, which promises wealth, instills a false hope in Ki-woo and his family. This prompts them to go on this risky affair which ultimately results in their own downfall. This leads to one of the most effective instances of symbolism in the film, as the rock is used as weapon against Ki-woo, symbolizing how his hope had betrayed him.By a blend of exceptional works done in the field of writing, directing, acting cinematography, editing and production design, Bong Joon Ho has constructed one of the best critiques of the modern day class divisions and wealth inequalities of the modern society. Despite detesting class divisions, Bong also acknowledges that such a division ultimately acts the backbone of the society. Once the distinction between these classes become inconspicuous, the foundation of the society will be disrupted, resulting in its destruction, a theme presented quite explicitly in his previous film, Snowpiercer.Through the eyes of the Kim family, Bong Joon Ho showcases one of the sad truths about our society. Due to the existing class divide, the poor in search of a better life, are forced to live as parasites on the rich, which in-turn causes an internal competitive conflict among the poor, resulting in their own doom, bringing them back to the same condition as before or to a much worse spot. These series of events are inevitable because our society is built on this nature and any attempt to change this nature will have catastrophic results. The film doesn't criticize the families for their actions. Instead, it criticizes the nature of the society which forced them to commit these actions.\n",
      "I decided to take a look, only after more than a hundred reviews, and probably in vain. Moreover, it's a shame that some reviews are fictitious. Simply put, many did not watch the film, but rewrote publicly available information about it on the web, not knowing what it was really about. I have nothing against this movie, but it's a one-off, as for me, and I'm unlikely to remember it in detail in a couple of months.It's interesting to watch, the film is addictive and attracts attention, but I wanted less plagiarism to come out. In terms of comedy, the film is not very bad. I liked the refined, unhurried and predictable humor. Drama? So-so drama of course.\n",
      "I enjoyed the first part of the movie but didn't feel anything. The ending was so so stupid and made me feel like Im watching cartoons.\n",
      "I agree with a lot of the reviews for Parasite. Parasite is a wonderful work of art that is open to many interpretations. One interpretation that I haven't read yet, which I found throughout the film is...karma.The poor Kim family struggles to make it in life. However, the Kim family cuts corners i.e. they lie, manipulate, cheat, etc. And as the old saying goes, 'you only get what you give in life', and that's kind of why the Kim's are where they are. The Kim's are good people in some way, as Mr. Kim demonstrates, expressing his shame about the driver they got fired. The Kim family has a conscience and they have some values, as most of us do.However, if you cheat, lie, deceive--it will always come back to get you i.e. the scene in Parasite where husband Park and wife Park are on the couch thinking of the underwear and they start sexually going at it while Husband Kim and daughter and son Kim are hiding under the table, listening to this. How awful that must have been for father Kim to hear that with his children right next to him. How embarrassed husband Kim must have felt at hearing he smells terrible, from husband Park, in front of his children--and how their was nothing husband Kim could do about it as he and his son and daughter were hiding under the table. The metaphor being that most of us in life can do nothing about it.But the Kim's did manipulate and cheat their way to the top, therefore their karma came back to bite them. And oh how it bites the Kim family in the very end. And it bites the Park family too. As the Kim family uses the Park's, the Park's use the Kim family for cheap labor--which in turn is a metaphor for the class war and for the war of employer vs. employee and how we all except such crummy wages and demands as a part of our society.In one scene, Mr. Kim says, 'no plan is the best plan.' Which is the same as the old adage, 'If you never have any expectations then you will never be disappointed.'Also, you could look at the stone like the story 'The Monkey's Paw.' Just like in The Monkey's Paw, the stone brings the Kim's good fortune...but at what price.Parasite is brilliant on so many levels that it's really a film you need to see two or three times to take it all in. It's a film that demonstrates that there is always someone worse off and Husband Kim gets his ultimate karma by taking the place of the person who was worse off than he was. Karma. It will always get you. And Parasite demonstrates this beautifully.Wonderfully acted and spiritually directed in the genre's most clever form. Parasite is not only a must see, it is a film you will not forget.\n",
      "What a masterpiece that was. Being familiar with the korean cinema and the overload of fantasy it carries every time, I wasn't really prepared for this rare gem. It's mix of pretty much every movie genre and a hell of an emotion ride.\n",
      "It all starts very smooth and simple, kinda funny too as we've been introduced the family. You can easily assume It's a family\n",
      "comedy drama. So far so good.. From the moment that the boy gets into this rich House and then, mess an chaos surrounded the place. It all turns into a crime, soft thriller mood and It's getting darker and darker until it explodes. I don't wanna say much because it will destroy all the fun. In my opinion you should not read or hear anything about the plot, before seeing this movie. The only useful tip, is good to know is that after the first 15-20 mins, starts a wonderful ride and you will definitely love every single minute of it.\n",
      "Spoiler ALERT\n",
      "Here in Greece we say \"The one who always searching for the Big fish, turns out losing and the small one (he already got)\". So never be greedy guys. Be thankful with what you have and always work harder if you wanna do better.\n",
      "Enjoy the movie guys. Every one has to watch this.\n",
      "P.L\n",
      "Parasite doesn't give a s... about following rules, sticking to the plan or pleasing the viewer\n",
      "The storyline is thoroughly thought, the characters deeply developed and the element of surprise is constantly around the corner during the second half of the movie. One of the best movies i ve ever seen\n",
      "Very good film which shows a certain parasitism on all sides. Humans parasitize each other at all levels. This film laughs it off with even a fight between parasites. Or fights.\n",
      "After seeing the reviews and nominations I decided to watch this movie . No doubt a very great movie with perfect depiction of greed and discrimination. I didn't liked the part when kim killed park don't the violence at the end just so much , they should've clearly explained why kim killed park ? Bad smelling can't be the only reason.But this movie is worth to watch, apart from all the k dramas in which it seems like everything is fine in South Korea the Director portrayed well that what we consider good is not Always like that for every one and yes poverty is a bane a curse and the only solution is too go on with our life with no plan but s goal to achieve .\n",
      "This review will contain as fewer plot spoilers as possible but just in case, I'll put the spoiler warning on as a precaution. I'm more basing this review on the films message and it's brutal, yet earnest look on how society views classism.This film is a beautiful window into societies socially charged economic hierarchy. Though the villainized upper class are the victims in our story, you can't help but feel morally conflicted while watching this film. You feel inclined to applaud the main families resourcefulness while also being forced to acknowledge the damage they cause to the livelihoods of the 'innocent' bystanders.For me, this film really made me question the class system generally. I came away from the experience feeling a wide range of conflicting emotions. But most prominently, satisfied. Whether it was the perfectly placed comedy, the sudden emotional transitions, the beautiful settings, the acting or even the perfectly appropriate title, across it's 132-minute runtime, everything about this film is a masterpiece, a true 10.If I had to describe this film's message in 1 simple phrase it would be - 'what truly is the difference between desperation and greed?'\n",
      "A good Movie. A Little to Long but definetly worth it and also surprisingly funny.\n",
      "I don't understand how this did so well as the movie is really substandard compared to other movies that come from this region. The way it's scored across all sites I thought it was going to be as good if not better than Oldboy. The reviews kept saying stick with it and there's a mad twist at the end. So I stuck with it even though it bored me half way through and the twist at the end was so underwhelming I was a little bit angry and wasted my time. This scored a strong \"Meh\" with me. Dont waste your time\n",
      "This movie is fantastic. It has the perfect mix of comedy and drama. It has realistic and fun characters and has a fantastic twist. You won't expect it and it is a really fun movie. There is a lot of symbolism and I promise that you will love it.\n",
      "Amazing movie with a great story. Actors do the good work. Screenplay and Direction got highest marks. Music is cool and thrilling. Atleast one time watch.\n",
      "While some people would say that this is boring, I find this movie quite relevant. It features how people live in the different spectra of society. The Rich. The Poor. Metaphorically, the movie was able to portray how most people live in a third world country.\n",
      "About lower classes fighting over a place \"below\" upper classes. Social. Hadn't get references.\n",
      "Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong. The acting is jarring and obnoxious until you get used to it, the characters and plot are one dimensional, the praised twists by the trailers and critics aren't exciting but shallow and even almost predictable. The scenes that are supposed to be thrilling, like the scene in which the rich family comes home earlier than expected from the vacation to the horror of the parasites, are ridiculous in a cartoonish way without anything of value to contradict it. The cinematography and shots are constantly almost awkward in their cheesy-ness and obvious structure. The film belittles its viewers as well, what only takes away from its own intelligence, by feeding them with a spoon its meaning - immediately explaining in words what was already told in visuals, which more often than not was completely unnecessary and dense. None of the characters make any truly moving progress, and even though the director claims in his movie there are no good and bad guys - he mostly failed to translate this sentiment into the film itself by making one dimensional, static confrontational characters.\n",
      "No matter how aesthetically calculated cinematic shots are, if there is no core-deep meaning in the film to back them up, they're worth nothing. Moreover, you can't calculate emotion. The visual storytelling of the shots in the film is so obviously calculated almost mathematically, with barely no internal intuition or feeling. And it only makes them awkward, as if the director only now graduated film school and wanted to show off everything he was taught without much experience (which isn't the actual case for Bong Joon-ho).\n",
      "It seemed like the director tried to achieve what Burning succeeded in obtaining, with addition of supposed-to-be-impressive high budget visuals, music and \"show\", but failed. Burning is a fantastic example to a mind and emotion intriguing film, full of thrilling twists and turns, true dark and concerning aura and human characters that touch the core of your being, which doesn't belittle it's viewers and taken straight out of the heart. Burning is what everything Parasite attempted to be without success. Bong Joon-ho thought too much, and ended up with barely anything of actual worth. Lee Chang-dong listened to his heart and intuition, and graced us with a beautiful, well crafted masterpiece, which in its humble and quiet progression spoke volumes and echoed in the viewer's mind and heart.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a perfect example to a film which is all bark and no bite.\n",
      "In one word: disappointing.\n",
      "It's rare to experience stories like this... it really drags you in. I'm surprised, throughout the film, you start to expect what will be next, but it has great twists that wash your expectations out of the ocean.\n",
      "This type of movie is rare to rarest,words are not enough to beautify it\n",
      "This is a fine piece of art, a true masterpiece. The plot is unique, clever and has things and messages to give. The acting and directing is also incredible. And about the score, what can I say? It is one of the best of 2019 in cinema so good and so fitting. Don't you thing that is one difficult artfilm to watch. No it is and can be pleasant and meaningful for all the viewers even they're used to watch blockbusters or artfilms. The plot has some action in it so avoid spoiler for sure! The direction is one of my favorite right now, every film from him was a cinematic enjoyment! And this must be his finest work so far! Just don't miss it!\n",
      "... what should I say about Parasite? This film is a real gem.The directing is just great, coupled with by an impeccable cinematography.\n",
      "The writing is entertaining and give the characters personality and layer, as well as the story. The themes are justified: the difference between well rich and poor family is one of them. The characters personality are reinforced by the great acting performances of the ensemble cast.Everything in this movie is a gem. Evrything.Bong Joon-ho, you are maybe one of my best filmmaker.Parasite rating: 85/100\n",
      "It's a pity that Parasite is attacking inequality with the poor's wrong face and choice. This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film, because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper. The structure and technique of the film are shocking, but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand. If you want to say what it makes people think about, it should be the most basic respect between people. No matter what class, status, or situation, you can really treat the other person as a person, not those inferior ones.\n",
      "I liked this film. The story is very interesting and deep meaning. Who are the parasites really? I think , this is the main question of the film.\n",
      "Very close to an 8, definitely recommended. Well-made well-directed\n",
      "Well, that was a thing. It reminded me a little of the humor of \"Being John Malkovich\", but without the wit, or wits. And with big doses of \"Eeew!\" But hey,on the bright side it makes me want to see \"Being John Malkovich\" again.I should have been forewarned because the writer/director Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed the execrable \"Snowpiercer\".\n",
      "I have to admit originally I wasn't much interested in watching this film in cinema cause at the time I was to lazy to read subtitles but my friend really wanted to watch this film and kept on insisting for me to go along so I just went and watched it in cinema and i did praise my friend alot for his choice what a great entertaining movie this was it kept me gripped through from beginning to end. At the time it was the best Korean film I had seen at the time and it is what got me to watch more korean movies and tv shows. I've seen this movie 3 more times sins in total 3 times in colour and 1 time in black and white. All the ratings and praises are there for the films but I would still encourage people who haven't seen parasite to definitely give it a try you will not be disappointed at any point. It is really fast moving and the performances are spot on all cast and crew have done a fabulous job.\n",
      "this is definitely 10/10 for me.\n",
      "Parasite is a great movie. It's very well paced and structured, and has an interesting and constantly evolving narrative. From a filmmaking standpoint, it's on a very high level.In the end though, I still felt it left something to be desired. I felt that the movie didn't have as much of an impact on me as I had hoped. The ending wasn't as cathartic to me as to others and I quickly forgot about the movie shortly after I watched it, even though I usually think about movies like this for days after I watched them.Maybe this can be attributed to the fact that I found it genuinely hard to really sympathise with the characters for different reasons and I didn't form a strong emotional bond with them - and without it, how am I supposed to care about their fate?It's sad what has happened to the hiding guy and his wife, but they were introduced so late in the movie and their characters didn't really get fleshed out.The big family (who the title probably refers to) got fleshed out quite well, but the more I learned about them, the more distant and unlikeable they became.As for the rich family, they are somewhere between the previous two. They had some character development, but not much, and they were neither liekable or unlikeable - so basically, I didn't care about them at all.Overall, I would still say that it's a pretty strong movie, but it lacks some kind of soul that would elevate it to a much higher level and make it truly stand out.Therefore I also think that the 96/100 Metacritic and 8.6/100 IMDB scores are undeservedly high. This movie is an 8.0-8,5/10 for me, which means that it should be somewhere around 80 on Metacritic and somewhere between 7-8 on IMDB.\n",
      "I was wondering about whether or not to watch this movie. Not a fan of Asian movies ... but I started watching it and within 2 minutes I was completely fascinated with it !! the purest Tarantino & Almodovar style... cast, script, dialogues, etc... you don't know if laugh or cry !!\n",
      "This movie was fantastic from the dialogue to the great scene presence of some of the characters. There is great humor, sadness and terror from this gem. Amazing story telling that really shocks and excites you as a viewer.\n",
      "Goood blalalalallalalalallalalalhsjsnsn I seeeee youuuuu\n",
      "Can guess what is going on and the way of acting of korean i do not like\n",
      "My first review ever. Well written, well acted, and well produced. The acting was on point, you feel attached to the characters. The scenery is amazing. And you will feel eager to what will happen next. It is full of surprises and unexpected twists. I am not a fan of a foreign language movies usually but after watching this movie it was an eye opener. It was a masterpiece! And it always will be one of my recommendations for friends. I rated this movie 9 out of 10. It doesn't bore you while watching and makes you wonder about the ending. A beautiful message is given about that thin line between the poor and the rich. Impressive indeed. I recommend everyone to watch it.\n",
      "What a wreck of a movie; filled with thoroughly loathsome characters plodding through a sophomoric plot towards a thoroughly predictable end (we didn't bother to hang around to confirm our expectations but having now read some of the reviews I see we weren't far off the mark).\n",
      "The frequently high ratings for this travesty leave me totally mystified.\n",
      "Yes, that's a question i put up to people saying they were bored and talking all trash about the movie. It's by far the best movie I've seen in a foreign language. The plot twist and the twisted end is worth it. If this doesn't satisfy movie watchers, god knows what will.\n",
      "In this film the author captured the ratio of lower social class in South Korea. Even though he portrays the family in a very comical way, he managed to show us their desire for a better life. It shows how they are able to do anything: lie, cheat just to achieve their dream.\n",
      "On the other hand, we have another family that stands as a representative of a higher class, they employ Kim Ki-woo' s family as a servant in their house. We can see big differences between social classes.\n",
      "The storyline of the movie changes drastically when Kim Ki-woo receives a stone talisman as a gift from his friend. This stone is supposed to provide them with happiness and money. And the boy believes in it, he puts all his faith in the stone, leans on it, and carries the stone with him even in the most difficult moment. He thinks that everything good in his life is due to the stone. Woo-sik Choi perfectly portrayed the character of a boy who looks innocent on the outside but hides a cunning plan inside.\n",
      "At the end of the movie Kim Ki- woo said : \" Dad, today I made a plan - a fundamental plan. I'm going to earn money, a lot of it. University, a career, marriage, those are all fine, but first I'll earn money. When I have money, I'll buy the house. On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard. Because the sunshine is so nice there.\" Which seems like an American dream. To study, to marry someone and be rich. That's what he wanted the whole movie. But we all know, that's never going to happen. It's just a beautiful lie. And American dream is a beautiful lie as well.\n",
      "It did shown us a different but real world between the poor and the rich. I think it is upset that the poor may never have a opportunity to catch up with the rich since they born.\n",
      "This film left me on the edge of my seat, fascinated throughout it's running time. The effort and genius poured into Parasite astounded me with every, single, shot. It does everything it sets out to do and more. I'm intentionally not giving specifics because you owe it to yourself to see this film as blind as possible. Then again, even if you know every story beat the execution on it's own is more than enough to earn multiple viewings. It doesn't take detailed analysis or film expertise to love this movie, but there's so many more layers to dissect if you seek them out. Just watch it, Parasite is a damn near masterpiece, and no matter your taste you will find a lot to appreciate.\n",
      "Hey, hunty! Let's spill the tea on \"Parasite.\" This movie serves opulence and twists, giving you the drama you never knew you needed. Bong Joon-ho serves sickening visuals and social commentary like a true kween. The poor fam's hustle? Iconic! The richies are a total serve of bougie realness. The class shade is real, honey - it's like watching shade-throwing at a ball. Cinematography is fierce, and the plot slays. You'll gag over the layers, sis! Just when you think you've got it, plot twists snatch your wig. \"Parasite\" ain't just a movie; it's a whole mood, a vibe, and a kiki. So, grab your popcorn, darling, and get ready to stan a movie that's more fab than your fiercest lewk!\n",
      "Being the first ever foreign film to win the best picture @ the Oscars, I had to give this a watch. Also this is a good choice for a lockdown time film, as nearly everything happens indoors!Was it oscar worthy? Well its shot beautifully, just like the director's earlier film - memories of murder. But coming to the movie, although its a fresh storyline about a wealthy family being conned by a poor family; I couldn't totally connect with the film. As I felt some portions were unrealistic or nonsensical I. E the parks never realised there was a guy living underground for years! or Kims hiding under the table for hours without getting caught or reason to kill Park in the end?!..But overall it is entertaining, dramatic & worth a one time watch, even just for a comic relief and good visuals to add.\n",
      "If you asian guy. You must watch this movie.i think this is the best movie. South korean family story. Amzing story ever i watched.what a marvelous movie.i never expect like that story.\n",
      "Gorgeous, memorable, and even startling cinematography, but surprisingly underdeveloped as the \"deep\" character and class study it pretends to be. Depressing nihilism. Director/writer clearly has given up all hope of modern civilization ever rising above the swamps of despair and manipulation. That's his right to an opinion, of course, but in this particular film his vision feels simplistic and seems to exist for no other reason than to provoke and wallow.\n",
      "Its Complete Movie with all emotional elements. 'Parasite's' opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road, sets the visual language of the film firmly, right at the onset. There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film. Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a clumisly heaped plate of food from a local kitchen.Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family live in a pokey, underground house and are generally unemployed. When we meet them, the family is perturbed that their access to free wifi has been cut short. Obviously not able to afford their own, they have been sponging off their neighbor's connection. In fact, even as a fumigation carried out on their street, Kim tells his family to leave the windows open so they can have a free extermination of the insects in their house, despite almost choking on the fumes. On some days, they get by with temporary jobs like fixing pizza boxes. So when his son Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is offered by a friend to be set up as an English tutor to the daughter of a wealthy Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), he agrees. Only hitch, Kim Ki-woo doesn't have a college degree having failed his university exams. But his sister, Kim Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) presents a quick solution to this with her expert photo-shopping skills. Armed with a forged degree document, Kim makes an easy impression on Mr. Park's wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) and their teenage daughter, Park Da-hye (Jung ji-so). There's also their nine-year-old son, Park Da-song (Jung Hyeong), scampering around the house, who Yeon-kyo believes has untapped potential as an artist. With one foot firmly inside the Park household, Kim Ki-jeong craftily places his sister as Da-song's art teacher cum therapist. Yeon-kyo's naivety and gullible nature makes this inclusion quite smooth. Soon with some careful scheming, fake identities and a well-rehearsed plan even his parents, Kim Ki-taek and Chung sook (Chang Hyae-jin) are employed in the household.It seems like a flawless plan with the Kim family settled into their new found roles and the sunlit, lavish mansion of the Park family giving it the perfect backdrop. But just like that, director Bong Joon-ho's screenplay springs upon us unexpected plot twists and a thrilling run up to a grisly yet astounding climax. Through a well-crafted maze of events the prevalent class conflict and social disparity come to the fore. The Kim's are often shown huddled together as a family, gobbling away at their meals and the Park's are often in their own expansive rooms, almost isolated from each other. In a telling scene, when Mr. Park discusses Mr. Kim's smell that wafts through the car when he drives, 'crossing the line' and reaching the backseat, he describes it as an 'old rag that has been boiled' and 'that smell that people who travel in the subway have'. It's evident there is unspoken disdain is on both ends, as Chung sook quips how Yeon-kyo is 'nice because she is rich.'\n",
      "With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il) as the film rapidly moves from one plot point to another. It results in a gripping yet poignant watch. The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.\n",
      "Parasite includes drama, mystery, comedy, romance, thriller and a few more genre, which makes it so multilateral, that everyone will find his part. Some people say it could be compared to the \"american dream\", which isn't wrong, because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college. But this is not the only background story. The whole movie is filled with metaphors, what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it. The pictures and camera angels aren't just good, they also imply a great many symbols, which makes it even more interesting to watch it. Sometimes it was a little too much for me, that's why I gave only nine stars. Anyway, if you want to see a great movie, Parasite is a good choice.\n",
      "The only reason I watched this film was because of the great reception it got at film festivals this year and word of mouth from the indie film scene. I'm not going to lie I don't watch a lot, if any, non-English language films...........don't ask me why I don't know. However after seeing this my world has been opened to the possibilities of other films that could be out there.Bong Joon-ho has directed a bloody fantastic film from start to finish............it is impeccable, I don't have a fault just praise.......His camera work throughout the film is ever changing, there is so much uniqueness to it.........I really don't think I've seen a film like it before. Coupled with some gorgeous cinematography, the film is amazingly beautifully shot............outstanding!!I'm not going to name names with the performances for a couple of reasons, firstly they are all incredible for their own reasons and also the fact that I have pretty much no idea who any of the actors are. That last point is actually a major positive for me because I didn't seem them as actors I just saw them as people on the screen, there wasn't the movie star or famous face that I had to get past.........in all english language films there is a I'm familiarity with those actors. It can sometimes take a while to buy into their performances, but by not knowing any of them it meant I bought into all the characters and their relationships straight away.The story is horrific...........but not in a gruesome way, this is the definition of a smart psychological thriller period. The story of a low-class family of con-artists who invade there way one by one into the lives of a upper-class family is genius, the film definitely deserves its english title. That is the central message of the film i think.......class and the gulf between the classes in society. Its not just spoken in the dialogue but subtly played on throughout the film, building towards a climax at the end. Trust me the end of this film is breath-taking and extremely clever. But not only the end there are so many twists and turns throughout the film that it always keeps you guessing..............especially the basement !!!!!!!The film has everything, tension, comedy, drama, seriousness, addresses societal issues, family relationships, sad endings and happy endings. Plus a lot of Kubrick esque stuff throughout..............However it is definitely its own film by a long long way.I am speechless after watching it and cant wait to watch it again 90% out of 100 it is simply brilliant from start to finish. Bong Joon-ho has opened my world to foreign language films...............my naive little British brain has been blown up. This film as well as its actors deserve all the acclaim and awards attention they get!!\n",
      "This honestly is my most favorite movie of all time that I've seen so far! Theres a lot of fantastic movies but this is definitely no.1 then Get Out, all the John Wick sequels, Avatar and Titanic. Theres more but I'll stop here. But this movie right here in my 30 years of living tops every last one. Bong Joon-Ho is a genius! Him & BTS are doing their country really freaking proud. This just goes to show you theres so much outside most peoples bubble that they dont know about because they're unnecessarily to closed minded & prejudice. The world has so much to offer if you're open to all its possibilities & ignore the thousands telling you no. Higly recommended!!! 100/10\n",
      "When I watched the movie, I was not excited by the movie poster, but when it started from the first moment until the last moment of the movie, I could not even touch the magnificence of the story, the imaginative events and the music that amazed me, and the enthusiasm that struck me from the beauty and sequence of the story that I did not and will not expect to come. A film with the intelligence of the writer. Yes, I listened, laughed, was affected, tensed, sympathized, hated, saddened, and got excited. Just imagine in a film that combined all these feelings, so I evaluated it with this evaluation, and I told everyone that if the film did not take the OSCArs as the best film, the ceremony would be unfair, but my suspicion was true, and the film only what was said. He is literally legendary.\n",
      "I've been a fan of Bong Joon-ho movies for a bit now. This is by far the best one I've seen. I'm not going to go into detail about anything. Just try to avoid spoilers before watching the movie. Trust me. If you've seen a Bing Joon-ho movie and like his style of directing, you'll like this. If you are just a fan of movies in general, you'll like this. As far as I know, there is not a dubbed version of this movie. If you're okay with subtitles, this wont be a problem. I understand that subtitles can be distracting, but I urge you to watch this movie anyway.\n",
      "First: the girl went down and took her boyfriend out! Didn't see that hidden door!\n",
      "Second: the Korean police just said the guy was homeless who came and killed the sister! However, the guy was living downstairs to hide from many people! I'm not sure if it was a gambling issue or not!\n",
      "So ending was totally nonsense and a really overrated movie! I enjoyed JoJo Rabbit and Marriage story much more personally\n",
      "Devious , cunning , ruthless, greedy people. All the characters were amoral. I enjoyed the whole story very clever. Much better than I expected.\n",
      "Everything is pure imposture\n",
      "Movie of the year: a wonderful cinematographic surprise, wellplayed, well done!\n",
      "Everything is pure imposture that seems to be the only way for the protagonist family, father, mother, son and daughter, to get a job at all and to reach the state of happiness. At one point, the disillusioning sentence is heard from the father: \"500 university graduates apply for a position as a night watchman.\"\n",
      "Everything could be so beautiful if the poor family's greed wasn't so great and their recklessness. They soon discover that the old housekeeper whom they had pushed out of their position has a dangerous secret that could endanger their new positions. This triggers a chain of surreal, mad and wonderful situations that lead to the poor family losing everything and more.\n",
      "But against the background of the madness of the rich family and their airs, all the sins of the poor family were finally excusable. It fills me with sadness that the poor, without rights always remain the poor and without rights, and with every attempt to change their fate they just slide deeper into their Schlamassel.\n",
      "Incredible screenplay, uncanny script with a completely unpredictable plot despite the anticipation of anomalous outcomes.. Clever comedic infusion with artistic representation of the consequence of deep social divide.\n",
      "I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation.\n",
      "Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's \"Get Out,\" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, \"Parasite\" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!\n",
      "Parasite masterpiece in this decade, excellent work.\n",
      "I'm not that guy who is doing a review on every movie I've liked or disliked, but this one is more than SPECIAL to me after watching it. I haven't seen such a remarkable movie for years, even the Oscar winners.This movie combines drama, comedy and romance which fits the movie perfectly. It will keep you engaged from the beggining till the end. Nothing and no one will be able to steal your focus and attention from this masterpiece - incredible!All appreciations for Bong Joon Ho for this movie. I will let you to discover it further, and leave your review/opinion on IMDb.10/10.\n",
      "Watch this movie. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was happily suprised that I was watching a masterpiece.\n",
      "I like the characters personality; I like how the film manages to build up the tension; I like the characters relationships; Every character feels important to the progress of the narrative; I like how the film manages to present the different perspectives of each family.\n",
      "This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.\n",
      "All the actors were fantastic. Ending was beyong immagination. Very dark thriller story. Well u need to watch to know the real parasite.\n",
      "Movie won the oscar, still I would vote Tumbbad compare to Parasite.\n",
      "10 stars for the acting. First 1hrs felt little slow, overall 6 points.\n",
      "I did not enjoy this movie at all and nearly walked out. My 2 adult daughters and I went, 1 had read the parent guide and was totally unprepared for the sex scene. It was WAY too graphic. We ended up looking away from the screen, but it was disgusting. Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor. There are solutions to our issues and I wish the media (including \"entertainment\" media) would stop pushing their agenda.\n",
      "What a creative film!\n",
      "I find Parasite as a wonderfully written story with amazing sequences of suspense mixed with a very well added comedy.\n",
      "What an overwhelmingly finale!, this may be one of the best movies of the year that i've seen by far.\n",
      "This is without a doubt one of the best movies I saw in 2019. The story is so original, it's funny, it's strange, but it could really happen.\n",
      "Tis reall shows how important it is to have more asian cinema and to have more asian americans be featured more in movies. This movie sows that asians can act and can have nuanced stories and not just all stereotypes. I love how genre bending this movie is and the performances...oh my gosh thats all i can say...oh my gosh..... ANYONE THAT WANTS TO WATCH THIS PLEASE DO NOT LOOK UP ANY SPOILERS DO NOT ASK ANYONE JUST GOT IN AND WATCH.Song kang ho is amazing. Park so dam is amazing.......theres nothing i can say but everyone needs to see this. This is the reason why this isbest picture and how it swept the awards season.\n",
      "Brilliant movie i ever watch makes my breath goes away !!!\n",
      "An interesting movie with a unusual concept and a great finael. Has a good balance betweem european and asian style, but i think it was long a bit. A good movie, but I don't understand this hype, and the enviable place in the top 250\n",
      "Every detail of the film is in the hands of the director with incredible precision, presenting an absurd social fable that is easy to dismiss as bloody-eyed. Audiences will be fascinated by the plot of the film, and they can easily understand the class gap presented by the film. Bong jun-ho USES techniques to largely eliminate the absurdity of the story into absurdity. It has the halo of the palme d 'or of cannes, but it has no cinema threshold, which is the ideal result of balanced art.\n",
      "Up until the end , the movie's is filled whith surprises and you definitely will not guess whats going to happen\n",
      "Amazing acting and script , well done.\n",
      "\"Parasites\" is not about a class or a group of problems, not about the parasitic relationship between poverty and wealth, but that everyone can have problems.In fact, the shortcomings of human nature is an inherent phenomenon left over, the human gene is from the competition for resources and competitive selection, is engraved in the blood of the bad history and relics, even if one day to achieve unlimited energy technology people no longer worry about livelihood, this feature is difficult to eliminate in a short time.But modern people are people because of the ability and rules of self-restraint, and if there were a criterion for distinguishing between the top and the bottom, it would probably be the capacity for reason, intelligence and empathy.\n",
      "When your daughter is stabbed or your son is unconscious, you won't focus on other's expressions or a man's smell. If you do, either you're a fake parent or mentally unstable.\n",
      "This movie has very unreal scenes.\n",
      "If you are nice, why are you eating other's jobs? If you are not nice, why are you letting old household inside?\n",
      "This movie shows lower class people as dirty parasites, scheming & looting others. I don't think everyone is like this.Poor people can stab others but rich people can't even talk about a body smell?? That too with their wife, in private??? You listening to their private conversation in intimate moments, reading personal diaries, lying about yourself is alright because you are poor?You can't stand anybody peeing in front of your house but feel bad when your boss doesn't feel right about your smell.Carrying a rock alone in that basement was really stupid.\n",
      "This movie made no sense at all after second half. I'm torn that joker didn't get Oscar.\n",
      "This is not really a review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions of the film.A film that wants to make a huge social criticism and does it very well for the first part and also for the central part and then gets ruined a bit in the final which makes everything too hasty and obvious for some things but also extremely incongruous for others. Let's talk about the plot which in general is brilliant and wants to tell the disparities between rich and poor but also how people can be fooled in a great way if you know what to do and when the film seems to have finished surprising it still manages to bring out something that keeps you glued to the screen. So to conclude wonderful movie but I didn't like the ending.\n",

      "Parasite is very well written and filmed, having many twists and scenes that leave you in complete shock wondering how someone managed to think about it, Bong Joon-Ho film has several genres within it, it goes through a very sarcastic comedy, for a terror, with a lot of suspense and tension involved, still being able to deal with social drama. This movie is stunning and completamente amazing, You need to watch at least two times to get all the inside things that this movie brings\n",
      "It is so interesting when someone it is able to do something knew and stand out this days, with the internet it seems like everything has already been done, and this movie was definitely something knew, the way they told the story and the shoots made watch the film much more unic.\n",
      "Beside all the action that this movie brings they also made a criticism about the differents classes, showing us the upper class and the lower one, how maybe a raining day was good and calm for you, but for others could be the complete opposite.\n",
      "Give me a break! That should be a film which deserves 4 Oscar's? Heavy handed directing and foreseeable script! Sorry don't get the hype! Only good thing: the film makes you uncomfortable!\n",
      "Parasite first don't expect something beyond your thinking (Connection between human and money) this is top in drama category, Oscars Worthy? Hmm yes it is, what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn't lose it's value the original script that doesn't fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn't leave any real plot holes, showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting, emotional, and unexpected series of events from the three sides, surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings, wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes, if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category, every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie, highly recommended for drama fans, 9/10⭐\n",
      "What a phenomenal film! This is an amazing one! One ofe. Thebest tottally recomend it.\n",
      "I don't write long reviews, and I'm not going to here. All you need to know is that this film is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Acting was superb, directing was world-class, plot was near perfect. Seriously, go watch this movie right now.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho once again delivers a great film with unexpected twists along the way. Parasite is a film about a poor family of four that slowly but surely worms their way into a rich family, by mostly luck and subtle persuasion. The son becomes an English tutor to the rich girl, the daughter becomes an art therapist to the young boy who can't sit still, the father becomes the driver for the successful man of the house and the mother becomes the housekeeper for the rich family.It's a family affair of course and things are well for a while as their employers are none the wiser. Then the old housekeeper comes back and it's revealed that she has been keeping her husband in the basement for about 4 years. Then, well. Things go downhill from there. There are death and murders. Some accidental, some purposeful. But in the end, I think they had a semi-hopeful ending.\n",
      "Set against an urban background bathing in pollution, floods, and the North-South tension as an ever-present echo in people's psyches, Bong Joon-Ho achieves a revelation of pure innocence of simple humans that are puppets of their circumstances. The relentless positivity of each studied family, even the little basement couple's, their love and dedication to each other keeps the audience in all the way through. It's hard to point the finger at any of the characters as the victim or the perpetrator, except the outside forces or the cutouts posted in the hiding place of the Housekeeper's husband. A Korean tradition by now, masterfully applied in the Wailing and The Chaser, there is an effective tonal play coating the baseline with humor which intensifies the suspense.\n",
      "Such a realistic live-movie. Opening with a funny scene, becomes to thriller, a comparison about the rich and the poor nowadays.\n",
      "With a masterful script and Bong Joon-Ho's (usual) brilliant direction, this film is easily one of the best of the year. The entire cast give amazing performances which keep you gripped and thats the main difference between this and Roma. I myself am not usually one for foreign films so if your first attempt at a foreign film was Roma and you found that a chore to sit through as I did, I urge you to watch Parasite. You won't be disappointed and the trailers do it absolutely no justice. Definitely a best director and best picture contender at the Oscars this year.\n",
      "...is that this fiasco rates above so many amazing movies on the IMBD top 100. This rates better than Casablanca?!? Inglorious Bast*rds?!?! Have our standards really sunk this low?\n",
      "Great movie , you'll find a lot of emotional moment and highly intensity.\n",
      "First of all , i Just wanna say that \"Memories of Murder\" is Still My Favorite Joon-ho Bong Film, But that doesn't Make this any less of a masterpiece in my Book, Definitely One of the best films of this decade,what a superb Mix of comedy and tragedy, Happiness and Sadness, joy and sympathy.\n",
      "First up, the movie is overrated, mostly by film critics. From a critic's point of view, it deserved a 9/10 solely for the great manipulation of scripting, acting, plot design and pace-setting.Plus, I would understand why film makers/ critics are crazy about this movie as the Director successfully played the audience, tricking them to accept a typical family, class-climbing drama with the simplest of tools and minimal resources into a blockbuster. Thus, I rate it as 9 as well.However, from one's own enjoyment as an audience, it is just hanging between a so-so 7/10 and probably, a better 8/10 as there are some solid and memorable moments that I truly enjoyed.Still, there are many reasons to why this movie has not done enough to justify a perfect score or rated as a masterpiece from a production point of view, especially since it did not deliver enough punches to make it relatively great in the big screen.The GOOD,\n",
      "Its success mainly lies in its ability to engage the audience (I would not say to all but mostly with South Koreans and foreigners who is interested with their culture) and my greatest applaud for it would be the deliberate shift from a classic cliche of Poor vs Rich. Instead, the two sides never collide in a direct manner, that is the only refreshing point of the typical plot and that in itself, is REALISTIC.The BAD,\n",
      "the movie does not live up fully to its title, Parasite as the effect of parasitic relationship would be to cause its host, harms to certain degree of annoyance.\n",
      "However, the host family in this movie barely felt any sense of hostility or annoyance or discomfort from the \"parasitism\".\n",
      "In fact, the accident to the Host family in the end just is completely unrelated to Parasite theme of the movie.Is it easily a fine line between cheap drama, shot well in terms of cinematography and a great classic as there are no elements of a blockbuster tool or shortage of an A-list cast to match its perfect score rating.\n",
      "In my opinion, instead of the camping twist that everyone is talking about, the impressive note that could have been a game changer would be the flood scene. Unfortunately, that was not well played and became a redundant scene instead.Still, the director is a genius, I would call him the Magician of the Cinema world as he effortlessly got everyone hooked into this illusion of a drama turned blockbuster. Well done!\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Great emotional beats, the three family units were all well written and the actors were great at communicating their roles and motivations\n",
      "Entertaining writing, the conflict in the first half was genius, while the second half was very unique\n",
      "Lots of moving parts, small stuff contributed to a larger society or culture\n",
      "Themes of class, wanting and deserving were expertly communicated, characters and story did a great job relating to them\n",
      "Very pretty settings, well shot throughoutCons:\n",
      "Second half is not as entertaining as the first\n",
      "Morse code stuff at the end is a little sillyBest part: getting rid of the old housekeeper, height of clever writing, entertaining family unit, was a great exercise in making the viewer want bad people to succeed\n",
      "Worst part: the mom threatening to involve the police with the underground people, I think they were trying to say the good life corrupted her to become a piece of crap, but it seemed out of character because of how quickly she responded like that\n",
      "I think there are far better movies that have been underrated I believe this is not better than \"meet the parents \"\n",
      "Highly recommended! A refreshing and unconventional genre-mix of comedy, drama and thriller elements, based on a strong social commentary about still existing class struggles in highly industrialized societies. Sounds a bit weird? Well, yes it is, but that makes all the fun of it, especially when serving here as a great example for the importance of intelligent screen-writing. A highly inspired ensemble of actors join and you have the surprise-of-the -year-film!\n",
      "I don't know, I wasn't very impressed. The beginning was rather a drag, I did like the plot in the middle, but it fell apart quickly for me and it crashed at the birthday party. Watchable, because it's unpredictable, but too hyped I guess or maybe it's just not my style.\n",
      "I have seen many Korean movies and they are al great and winners but not this one, and this one takes the cake?Movie lovers these days are a bunch jokers or what?Film critics and fans have one thing in common: give 10 out of 10 just because they read the headlines.It's bizarre that we live in a world that biased thinking makes the movie bigger.This is not a winner the real winner from Korea is JSL or Old Boy or The Host.\n",
      "What a movie! It was such a pleasure to watch, the hours kept passing and I was completely amazed by the masterpiece that the briliant Joon-Ho Bong made. This is the kind of movie, that makes me so deeply in love with cinema! So, all I can say is thank you Joon-Ho Bong for making this speechless movie.\n",
      "... last year \"they\" came up with ROME : A year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City in the early 1970s. ... now arrives this soap-box genre project .... is the world of cinema and snob film festivals becoming so much inclined towards kitsch box-soaped melo dramas ?\n",
      "A great Korean movie that doesn't disappoint. This movie starts off as a comedy drama, then turns into a mystery followed up by a thriller and ending with heart. A great ride for those not afraid of subtitles.\n",
      "Saw \"Parasite\" yet again and was once again entranced by the movie's brutal depiction of the ramifications of being vulnerable. But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. \"Parasite\" is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black & White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved \"Parasite\", watch Jordan Peele's \"Us\".\n",
      "Best storyline I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Would definitely recommend seeing.\n",
      "Often we come across this saying that \"Ignorance is not the same as innocence\" and another saying that \"Ignorance is bliss\". This film captures them both. On the one hand there are the Kims, a family of four living in sorrowful condition in a semi basement structure, on the other hand there's the wealthy Park family, living in a rich neighborhood uptown. But with riches, comes ignorance. An eventful twist in the tale for the Kim family, leads all of them being employed by the Parks and how they start to feed off their hosts, just like a parasite, much to the ignorance of the ignorance of the Park family. When all things seem to be settled for the Kims, there comes another turn of events which gives the film a deeper metaphorical narrative. Parasite is one of such pictures that makes you look into the society you live in, makes you uncomfortable at times and questions your ignorance. You may think that your housemaid is working for you but is she really? Would you trust your car driver? Or your child's tutor?\n",
      "I was hoping for something more.I thought it was going to surprise me but it wasnt.It is fun but lacking of wow factors.\n",
      "I'll give this a 10 because there is no room for improvement. My first 10. Loved it. A mix of everything in one movie. Cannot give any spoilers away..you'll have to watch for yourself. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "The movie has high ratings and after what the director said about getting over subtitles, I had to give it a go. Parasite is not bad but I wouldnt give it a 10. Its a beautiful film and I loved the comedic storyline. However, I did not like when they introduced the ex-housekeepers husband hiding down in the basement. I felt like that whole plot felt messy. Like they started something and didnt know how to finish it so they just did something random. Maybe that was supposed to be the point, but it messed with the comedy that the movie began with. Parasite went from being witty and funny, to trying to be a suspense-horror film and it just didnt go well together.\n",
      "I've watched South Korean films most of my adult life. Films such as \"The Way Home\", \"The Handmaiden\", and \"Train to Busan\" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests. Yet, this concept is nothing new in SK films.\n",
      "From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies. I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again. I'm glad it won the Oscar for best foreign picture, totally deserved.\n",
      "I really appreciated the film. The director was subtle but his end result was strong and intense. It made me very uncomfortable. I probably would not watch it again, but it is worth watching. Acting was without a doubt great.\n",
      "The ending left me truly staggered. Bong joon-ho's originality was mind blowing, and easily recognizable as inspired by Psycho. A very subtle Hitchcockian touch to the flick.Truly great film.\n",
      "This a real gem. It made me laugh, think, shiver. I love satires and this is one of the best I've seen.\n",
      "The Movie have a few very interessting situations, in which the audience don't know if it should laugh or be serious. It's a Arthouse Movie and not a Blockbuster with very much action in it. The camera, the location and the story of the movie a very good. The house of the rich family reminds me a little bit at the house in the movie \"Ex Machina\". The style of the movie is similiar to other korean movies like \"Burning\" or \"Oldboy\".\n",
      "Maybe it's because I watch KDramas but I did not like this movie. One doesn't leave this movie and say, \"Oh, I wish there would be a sequel!\". Or, dream happy thoughts about the joy of watching it. All I can think about is who reviewed this movie and what were they thinking when they awarded it? Is this \"Top Drawer\" for what people want to see? Is this ugly, uninspiring and violent film one we want the next generation to prolificate? I hope not! Give me, \"Crashing Down On You\" as a movie and it would probably bring in as many dollars as Downton Abbey. This movie hasn't gone off the charts with numbers of viewers. It was slow, off kilter, bad language and unreasonably violent at the end - it was like a bad \"Chuckie\" movie. This film has probably ended some to watching Korean films.\n",
      "I will admit I'm a bit late but it really was a happy new year after watching this MASTERPIECE!!\n",
      "Straight away I had a inclination that this film would be amazing from the cinematography right from the beginning. The story line was just so captivating and I've never seen it done before. I HATE starting new things or watching new films but I'm so glad I did with this!\n",
      "No wonder it took the OSCARS by storm\n",
      "One of the best film I ever seen in my whole life. Masterpiece.\n",
      "I admit I wouldn't have gone to see a subtitled movie if it hadn't won Best Picture. Don't normally enjoy reading movies. This movie was worth it! Got drawn in immediately with the characters and stayed enrapt as the plot developed. No dull moments for sure. Did make me think about class and how the haves and the have nots lead parallel lives, with the haves not really \"getting\" the have nots. Loved this movie!\n",
      "Holy crap this movie was fantastic I've never been so invested in a foreign film before. Go see this immediately.\n",
      "Parasite is an awesome movie. I would totally give full 10 star, but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal, I didn't like the end of the movie...I was not sure who actually the parasite was, the family, or just the guy in the cellar? Who was actually supposed to be the hero, bad and good guy in the movie? somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad-ass...\n",
      "The window looks like a movie screen. At the outset, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho immediately evokes Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\", the 1954 mystery thriller about the man in a wheelchair who diagnoses a neighbor's murder plot against his wife from across the courtyard of an urban apartment complex. On a subtextual level, photographer L.B. Jeffries(James Stewart) is a voyeur; he glimpses scenes from ordinary people's lives that were never meant for his eyes. Film theorist Laura Mulvey, in her essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\", linked with moviegoing with voyeurism. We like to watch, more or less, is what Mulvey surmised. When Lars Thorwald(Raymond Burr), the surveilled man, does nothing integral to the cover-up of his wife's murder, Jeffries naps with his body faced away from the mini-dramas unfolding in each apartment square. Ki-woo(Choi Woo-shik), in \"Parasite\", the 2019 winner of the Palm d'or at Cannes, would rather squint at a tiny screen, as demonstrated by the camerawork, a downwards tilt, in which we see the young man staring into his phone instead at the world outside from the sofa of his family's semi-basement apartment. Just like everybody else, Kim Ki-Woo would rather watch a movie on a five-inch screen, instead of the communal experience you get from traditional movie exhibition. But Bong, for the sake of contrast, replicates Hitchcock, with four voyeurs, not just one, watching a man urinate in their alleyway, a nod, perhaps, to Italian neorealism. Later, the same man returns to relieve himself, but this time, Ki-woo's college friend, Min-hyuk(Park Seo-joon), defends their garbage area with thrown bottled water. Both projections of liquid, the water and retaliatory pee, are subjected to slo-mo, transforming narrative into spectacle.Ki-woo is unemployed. So are his parents and older sister. To pay the rent, they fold pizza boxes; they copy the woman on the pizzeria's website. This repetitious task may look mundane, proletarian and unsexy, but there are people with fetishes, and these fetishists with a predilection for androgynous-looking women who convert cardboard into boxes are voyeurs, too. The Kims don't use Microsoft cell phones, but if they did, the Lumia would run Windows, an apt description of what Jeffries sees from his vantage point; open windows, which run in diametrical opposition to his rear window. Mulvery recognized that the photographer with a leg cast was a peeping tom. Jeffries ogles a woman he identifies as \"Miss Torso\"(Georgine Darcy), who does calisthenics in what looks like a proto-sports bar. The moviegoer identifies with Jeffries; the moviegoer also likes to look at women in various states of undress in the dark. The \"male gaze\", as she coined it, because of wireless streaming, no longer, in filmic circumstances, is no longer confined to a theater seat; the female image went mobile and saw light. The woman who is good at making pizza boxes has no control over her own image.Min-hyuk tutors the girl of a very rich family. Ki-woo's old high school buddy needs a replacement, somebody he can trust, while the English-speaking student attends college abroad, in America. To get the plum job, Ki-woo can't show that he's overawed by his luxurious surroundings. At the Park family's domain, he has to be Ki-woo in italics, an actor; a cool customer. Yeon-gyo(Cho Yeo-jeong), the girl's mother, insists on observing Ki-woo conduct her daughter's first, and potentially, last college preparatory session. When Da-hye(Jung Ji-so) errs on a practice test question, the tutor grabs this rich girl's wrist with two stern fingers, and reprimands her for lacking confidence, which, in effect, levels the playing field for Ki-woo by being the man made out chutzpah, not money. Ki-jeong(Park So-dam), Ki-woo's sister, hired as an art therapy teacher for Da-song(Jung Hyun-joo), the Parks' young son, is even bolder; she banishes the micro-managing mother from the room. Yeon-gyo would never guess that this pair of young adults live in the ghetto. If she knew how disparate the socioeconomic gap between both families were, both Ki-woo and Ki-jeong would probably be fired on the spot. Along with the meditation on voyeurism, \"Parasite\" shares with \"Rear Window\" the depiction of class-consciousness. Although Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly), a Manhattan socialite, gives L.B. Jeffries an inferiority complex, this strained relationship withstands the photographer's emasculation, because the female fashion tastemaker, a seeming first lady of haute couture, believes that \"there can't be much difference between people and the way they live\". In \"Parasite\", however, it's not just class consciousness, it's class warfare, since money matters to both the Park and Kim family alike. Park Dong-ik(Lee Sun-kyun), an information technology firm CEO, talks repeatedly about lines that the \"help\" can't cross. The chauffeur, Ki-taek(Song Kang-ho), Ki-woo's father, overhears Dong-ik telling his wife that he smells; an odor which could be more metaphoric than literal. In \"Parasite\", all the compromises to fit in are made by the Kims, whereas in \"Rear Window\", it's Lisa who has to change, slumming she does, as exemplified by being interested in the book \"Beyond the High Himalayas\", for the sake of the fragile male ego. She has to remake herself in L.B. Jeffries image of an ideal woman. That's not how the world works anymore. All the splendor in this rich family's house turns the Kims into parasites.The window at the Park residence looks like a movie screen, too; and this window is in the backyard, a rear window. Nothing but green grass, a perfect lawn with tastefully chosen plants and flowers at its borders. But then, after the Park family comes home from a camping trip ruined by rain, Da-song pitches an Indian tent, transforming the performative soundstage into a western. Now there is a genre film waiting to happen, a western, just like how \"Rear Window\" turns into film noir, when he realizes the machinations of Lars Thorwald. The point-of-view shots in the Hitchcock film all come from Jeffries' perspective; the audience never sees L.B. from Thorwald's vantage point. In other words, Hitchcock doesn't employ the shot/countershot when Thorwald understands that somebody is watching his every move. Joon-ho, on the other hand, shows the Park house interior, not as a POV shot, but as a reverse shot; an omniscient one, in which only the real audience, not a diegetic audience of one, sees the melee between the Kims and Moon-gwang(Lee Jung-eun), the former housekeeper, and Geun-sae(Park Myung-hoon), her husband, who lives in a bunker secreted away within the house. Although Moon-gwang and her imprisoned husband share the same class status as the Kim family, the ex-housekeeper, who once doted on the house's famous architect, judges not just her former employers, but the help staff, as well, for being philistines. Moon-gwang narrates a flashback scene in which we see herself and Geun-sae not just inhabiting the place like riff-raff, but experiencing the living room as aesthetes. With a great sense of nostalgia and loss in her voice, Moon-gwang describes the sunlight, when it hits the glass, the reflection then casts a lovely glow upon the entire house. It's coded talk for celluloid. A reminiscence that is starkly contrasted to the mis-en-scene, in which the aesthetes and philistines fight over incriminating digital footage on Moon-gwang's cell phone. You can watch \"Rear Window\" on a cell phone.Ki-taek tells his son: \"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. Because life cannot be planned.\"Lisa goes off-script. Stella(Thelma Ritter), L.B.'s housekeeper, tries to stop her, after they discover no evidence to support foul play when they dig up the courtyard flower bed. She climbs the exterior staircase to Lars Thornwald's apartment. Lisa crosses the line, echoing Dong-ik's words, but in an extra-diegetic sense, as she transforms herself from spectator to subject; another actor in L.B. Jeffries' movie. He watches his girlfriend find proof, Ms. Thornwald's wedding ring, just before the murder suspect returns. Lisa's ad-lib results in the conviction of Lars Thornwald. Conversely, in \"Parasite\", the lay of the lawn is sandwiched between a rear window and, quite pointedly, rear bushes, where Ki-taek and his boss hide, dressed as Indians for Da-song's birthday party. Unlike L.B. Jeffries, his cross-generational counterpart, Ki-taek, despite being positioned as a voyeur among voyeurs(his wife and children), never was the spectator, because the relationship between spectator and subject is a fluid one, always interchangeable, the two positions. Technology transformed the world into a movie screen. The Park family is an aggregate of Lisa, but unlike the clotheshorse, Dong-ik, the IT CEO, especially, believes that there is a difference in how people \"eat, talk, drink, laugh, and wear clothes\". In the chauffeured car, Dong-ik sits in the rear seat, a barrier, but at the birthday party, hiding behind the rear bushes, without a visible barrier, Ki-taek knows that it still exists, even though they are dressed identically as Indians.The voyeur doesn't have to sit in a darkened theater anymore. It's not 1954. The voyeur carries with him a cellphone. The Park living room, metaphorically speaking, is the theater. But nobody has to be on the sofa to watch the ensuing melee, in which Ki-taek crosses the line and stabs his employer in the heart with a large knife. Films are mobile now. The voyeurs are in the backyard, close to the murder; spectators and subjects, sometimes one, sometimes both.\n",
      "It was a really good dark comedy. It was boring in parts. Definitely some flaws. I'd say the 1st half was the better part. It didn't deserve any of the oscars it received. Snow piercer was a better movie by the director and even that didn't deserve any oscars. I love the director though.\n",
      "This isn't a feel-good movie. It is is the cold harsh reality of whatever the movie's message was. I was too grasped on the story itself to see the bigger picture. That could be the message itself. It really took my perspective of life and twisted it.\n",
      "This movie was ok. Nothing incredible. Interesting idea but nothing special. This movie was not better than Joker, Once upon a time in Hollywood or The Irishman. Its just my opinion.\n",
      "3 observations came to mind after watching this film:When you have a film whose sole purpose appears to be to make some sort of metaphorical analogy of society, you will invariably find gaping holes in its plot, which the director will simply expect you to overlook.There is no longer a \"safe\" outlet where one can find honest reviews of any sort, for any film, including forum sites, where people are supposed to share honest, unbiased opinions. And definitely not this site!The goal of the army of \"recruited\" reviewers is to get you, the consumer, to watch the film. Period.\n",
      "A very nice plot with lovely actors and an unexpected twist.\n",
      "When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing.\n",
      "I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here.\n",
      "I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color.\n",
      "Parasite was a hell of a film. It kept me engaged and wondering where the plot twist would place itself. To my surprise, there were several twistings of the plot, if you will. All in all I enjoyed and celebrated the construction and deliverance of this project.\n",
      "Parasite is an amazing film which depicts social disparity in Korea with an incredible sarcastic tone. It brings forward the idea of the American Dream on a surreal atnosphere, with one of the most effective twists in cinema this year. Having the rock serve as a metaphor to the plot itself and how it progresses was a very smart choice by Joon Ho.\n",
      "9.5/10, favourite scenes: The peach sequence, The opening scene and the scene with the twist.\n",
      "This was simply amazing and has raised the bar unfortunately for all future movies I watch.\n",
      "A normal film with a non-credible story that has been idolized by the masses for frankly no reason.2 hours where the best parts are one only: a beautiful italian song from the 60s.Assigning a 6 as total score I'm generous.\n",
      "Despite the positive reviews of the film critics, it didn't inspire me much. Honestly, after watching it, it was hard for me to imagine how this film won Oscar and other awards. Both in terms of technical aspects, as well as the characterization and the way the story was told, I believe it was an ordinary film. Therefore, I would give it 60 out of 100. The only thing I liked was the story itself and its message for the audience, regardless of attention to professionalism in storytelling. During the film, I was waiting for a scene passionate and influential but I couldn't get it. However, I suggest you watch it. It worths doing that. Happy New year 🙂\n",
      "If it was only the 8.6 on IMDB I could say it's because of the accounts, or anyone can vote or something like that... But it has 6 Oscar nominees, won Palm d'Or, and hundreds of other awards and I really can't get HOW?\n",
      "It's an ordinary movie, I'll only remember it for how overrated it was.\n",
      "English is my first language and I'm always hesitant to watch foreign films because of the subtitles. It's challenging and sometimes an effort when I want to relax and watch a movie. I'm so glad I made this choice to watch the Parasite. The film is original and very well shot. I loved the actors and by the midway point I forgot I was reading subtitles, the film pulls you in to its world. Fantastic film and I will check out more of the directors work.\n",
      "Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple, drawing the viewer's interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements, after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally.We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for, no \"good guys\" of the story. The film focuses on \"crossing the line\" which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it.\n",
      "This movie is about perfection in all aspects of its execution. I did not blink at all the whole time. Jeez, even my first two sentences of review sound like it's an action-packed thriller. But this movie makes itself everything, from satire to horror. Great!\n",
      "The way this movie quickly escalated made it a must watch totally worth it.\n",
      "Being an Asian myself, it feels great to see Asian films win the Palme d'Or for two consecutive years. Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story. Most spectators, while watching the first half of the film, might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs. Well, the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer. The second half is full of vehement conflicts, as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared. The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric. Educated and civilized as they are, the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy. Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe. Impoverished people, despite trying every means they are able to get hold of, be it wily tricks or honest labor, will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder. Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair.\n",
      "Parasite is one of good movies directed by boong joon ho, but I think the best from him was \"memories of murder\" movie, and this movie is number 2.The lead character acting was flawless, especially kang-ho song. He the only one that brings thrill to the story.I think this movie is lighter than memories of murder, but i think more people like it. I think parasite a little bit overrated.\n",
      "So I finally saw Parasite and after weeks and weeks of hearing about how great this movie is, I didn't think it could possibly live up to all that praise.Well, it somehow managed to be even better than I anticipated.\n",
      "How the hell did Bong Joon-Ho manage that?!This is an incredibly tense, darkly funny, beautifully shot and amazingly acted masterpiece and I loved every minute of it.From now on, I'm staying away from basements\n",
      "The story is very common in Asia. But I just don't like how everything looks. So dark and scary. A good film to show the real world, but not a good film to enjoy.\n",
      "Good actors, well filmed, but the story is predictable and too depressing. It does not deserve at all its oscars and all this fuss about it.\n",
      "I had this film ruined for me by Twitter and STILL thought it was excellent.My mind would've been blown if I'd have been oblivious.\n",
      "My first Korean movie in US theater!!! Great script & surprise storyline and funny too. Very entertaining! Even though I am not familiar with any of the actors but they did a wonderful job to keep me engaged to the movie. No wonder this movie won many awards!!\n",
      "The movie \"Parasite\" has one of the best screenplay in the history of cinema. Director and author Bong Joon Ho transcends with a story that is super original, smart, witty, and capable of holding the audience until the end of the film. Bong Joon Ho jokes and discusses the disparities between rich and poor through a family that uses every subterfuge and trickery to be part of a higher layer of society. But once infiltrated, they realize that they are still considered second-class, even for the aroma they emanate. A great cast that enhances even further the strong plot. This is a novie not to be missed.\n",
      "This is one of those films that will throw you off if you watch the trailer, but that is a good thing. It keeps your attention from the first to the last shot. Very dark comedy extremely well executed.\n",
      "This movie is great. The cinematography, the acting, the music, the writing, the directing, everything was great! The movie has some really funny scenes too.\n",
      "This is a darkly comedic, shocking, masterpiece about rich and poor.\n",
      "That sums up it all. When the characters seem to have been made to order, so as to fit the plot no matter what, chances are you won't enjoy the film. You will still be curious to see how it ends, though.\n",
      "One of my favorite films is \"Parasite\". Despite the fact the film's plot reflects social inequality, it is presented straightforwardly and simply. Throughout the story, the film asks us to ask questions in our heads. More than that, it is excellent in terms of production. Every point of view, color grading, and sound effects are meaningful and exciting, drawing the audience even deeper into the film. Overall, it's still a fantastic film with a great script. To make it more understandable, the film concerns heavy topics like class and social inequality. The audience can answer the question at the end of the story that the villain of the story is not poor or the rich, but social inequality, which causes people to be villains.\n",
      "Very well made film. It was very thrilling and each scene had you wondering what was coming next. The ending with the violence was disproportionate to the very well crafted first 3/4s off the film. After it has you feeling a bit disturbed, well made but the ending was too violent for good taste.\n",
      "Do not watch this if your IQ surpass amoeba´s!!!!One of the worst movies I have ever seen.There is absolutely nothing in this crap worth of anybody´s time and attention.Except for the opening 5 mins or so, there is no smart moment in its132 min runtime.Title is fitting though.\n",
      "Well written. the ending was amazing, left me with an open space so my imagination could fill it as i would like.\n",
      "A great plot! Fascinating. Should've cut more unnecessary scenes though to get to the pace. I have to skip some prolonged story lines that doesn't add value to the story and characters.I love each character arc. I love the story. It was awesome.\n",
      "Even if subtitles aren't your thing, you can enjoy this. Great story, so unique and well thought out. Honestly, it's creative storytelling at its best. From the opening scene to the outstanding ending, it's just a great ride.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" Directed by Bong Joon Ho, maker of critically acclaimed movies \"Memories of Murder\", \"The Host\" and \"Snowpiercer\", is a superbly crafted and a masters work who is in full command of his craft and so confident in his filmmaking that it doesnot hold anything back. It is\n",
      "socially relevant and totally unique and original blend of horror, comedy and thriller.\n",
      "Rating: 9.5\n",
      "Great Acting, Incredible Direction, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay (Both how Comedic it is and how trilling and powerful it is) even though it is in Korean and I was reading subtitles, Score was great in how it complements the movie, Incredible Symbolism in the commentary on Class Conflict, The Movie is broken into two separate parts (A comedic half and a thriller half), The pacing of the movie is very off because it spends too much time on the comedic side when a little bit more should be placed on the second half due to the commentary it is trying to convey, The issue with the pacing leads to the ending/epilogue to be very rushed, Overall Incredible Movie.\n",
      "Just watch the movie. trust me. A truly Masterpiece from Bong Joon Ho.\n",
      "As per me the movie does showed the consequences of \"bad guys\" in the end and no doubt that the first half of the movie is so amazingly plotted , the boy got referred then he refer her sister then she refer her father then mother - this really made it interesting but somehow i found the second half not that much interesting.\n",
      "Good film but way too many plot holes or grandiose surreal situations. The social theme was great to show the difference between lower and upper class, while maintain equal footing and save face when they met. When the driver got fired for adult act presumed , why wasn't she dismissed ? - this fell flat to be satisfactory answered. The rich family even thought possibility of drugs ..but kept her on? The movie should of ended for her there. Why was the ex-house maid husband stuck down there without any knowledge of rich family. Seemed far fetch and same when main actor father went down there. Flicking light would of been fixed or traced to underground passage. Numerous other questions but too long to write. The praise it got is overblown as far from sustained perfection through, albeit entertaining moments .\n",
      "This movie is literally a MASTERPIECE\n",
      "A criticize of all classes, even your place in society, everything can change so quickly. The way the different topics are covered, the way the film is built.What makes it stand out even more is its originality. Who has ever seen such a mix of topics (which are not necessarily directly addressed) without thinking \" that's too much\" ?Impeccable acting, developed characters, a dynamic film... What more could you ask for?\n",
      "Everything was going great until the ending came. Why did he kill his boss? And also the basement guy?! Well that was unexpected. Why was no one stopping him and why did he bring the rock to the guy? The ending could've gotten much better.\n",
      "This movie is so traumatizing that I had to stop at one hour and resume its viewing the next day, but guess what: the second half of the film is even worse, in a GREAT way...\n",
      "I wasn't expecting something as good as this. Excellent. A modern masterpiece.\n",
      "I don't blame this movie.. overall it has story (Ok) , good screenplay (though most scenes were so predictable!) and a typical chinese thriller drama movie.. still wondering So,is this enough to won Oscar?!\n",
      "Thats why the rating is so high on this.Its a good movie, with a clever idea but not really well enough excution to deserve a rating of +8.WHY should they ever even think for a second about letting the previous lady in to the apartment? They had thrashed the place, and she was about to pass next to them... Why even think for a second about letting her in?And there are more things that are a bit \"really....? Come on...\"\n",
      "Rich like hell, and they NEVER check references... yeah.And I was looking forward to the \"horror\" and I got.... nothing. A stupid totally unexpected attack from the father. Like why?-1 just for that. Uncalled for, stupid, and not even close to be motivated in the movie itself.\n",
      "TLDR : Worst movie I have ever seen,without a dobut.Plot:There is a poor and a rich family.The poor family lives in a small apratment somewhere outside of the city,while the rich family lives in a big mansion.The son in the poor family somehow becomes a teacher of the daughter of the rich family,although he is uneducated and not qualified for that job.That simply makes no sense to me.Then he gets the job for his sister,who becomes a psychologist for the rich's family young son,while also not being qualified for the job,and he presents her as Jessica who used to study in America,and not as his sister.The movie becomes pretty predicatble and naive at this point,everybody can realise that they will eventualy get jobs for both their parents and that their goal is to kick the rich family from the house,which is really shallow plot if you ask me.\n",
      "Then the daughter of the poor family leaves her underwear in the car,what makes the father of the rich family fire the driver,and you guessed it-he hires the father of the poor family as a new driver,although he doesnt have any recommentadions(i don't count fake recommendations here)\n",
      "And then the poor family founds out that the maid is alergic to peaches,and they get her sick.As a big surprise,the mother of the poor family becomes a new maid.\n",
      "What a deep movie so far !\n",
      "As very smart criminals they let the old maid get into the house,and she visits her housban in the basement where he has been living for four years,Yes you have read it correctly,he has been living in the rich's family basement for four years without anybody noticing it.Then the poor family and old maid & her housband get into a fight,instead of cooperating thogether,in order to steal as much money as they can.\n",
      "At this point I asked myself,can it get more shallow than this ?\n",
      "Then there is 50-ish minutes of them fighting and hiding in the house without rich family noiticing that they are there.And finally the husband of the old maid(who is btw. insane,what is disgusting) comes out of the basement and tries to kill people,what is very badly acted.REWIEV:The plot is so shallow,predictable and stupid.Rich family is fireing their employers without any real evidence of them doing something wrong,but just because poor's family members told them so.And then they are employing the rest of the poor family memebrs(mom and dad) without them having any job experience nor recommendations.\n",
      "I understand that the poor family members are suposed to be the villains here,but they r not \"interesting vallians\" like president Snow in The Hunger Games,or Darth Vader in Star Wars or Joker. in Batman seriesThey are not vallians,they are just parasites.They are not even \"smart criminals\" but rather stupid ones like burglars in Home Alone.\n",
      "First 30 minutes of the movie were OK-ish and i would rate them 6/10 ,but after that it gets super predictable and shallow.There is also a guy in the basement who is pressing the switch with his head which is really,really disgusting.\n",
      "I wish there is option to rate this movie 0/10 and turn back time so i can not watch this movie and live my life for extra 2 hours in total.\n",
      "This is one of those movies that makes me want to live the Earth and find a new planet to live.In my opinion,how this movie has 8.6 rating and has won Oscar is bigger mysteria than how the univers was created.\n",
      "I am so disgusted by this movie that even though I made my imdb account back in 2013,I decided to write my first rewiev.\n",
      "Good movie, nothing more nothing less..8 is a fair rating... 9-10 gets perfect movies for me...\n",
      "From my point of view, I love how the movie tell the story, it doesn't make me feel confuse a lot, but it has some. I love when I movie pull me in the movie feeling, I have many emotional during the movie show, some part was heartbreak, and some was suspenseful. This movie can reflect what really happen in South Korea society, but I trust it doesn't have only in South Korea. This movie can makes other know more about poor person that we might unforeseen. After I watched, I ask myself who is the real parasite poor person or the rich one or everyone is parasite. This movie has a lot of small detail such as speech, action such as in a gag it also has some real situation which is bad joke in their life too but when they play joke it makes me laugh too. Not only details in the action but the scene has a lot of small details too such as tone of movie, sound, and camera angle such as the divide line in the movie that always divide between rich person and poor person. I trust that everyone works really hard to make this movie, performer can do good perform and script writer can write really good script too. But I give 9/10 because some scene it's a bit hard to understand such as about the person who is maybe the old mate's family, I confuse in their relationship how they come and why he is here. May be I miss some part of the movie.\n",
      "Parasite thoroughly deserved the best picture Oscar and for once in a long time it's a winner that will be remembered as a classic. It's a master class in film making!Don't read reviews or a synopsis, just watch the magnificence unfold before your eyes.\n",
      "A magnificent black comedy by Bong Joon. Parasite is about class difference, greed and a lot of other things all wrapped into one. A highly engaging film, perfectly written and masterfully directed. It deserves all the awards it has received. 9/10\n",
      "The Kims, a clever but out-of-work family living in a Seoul basement slowly inveigles themselves into the lives of the Parks, a wealthy family living in a designer home looking down on the city, only to discover that they are not the only people abusing the Park's unwitting hospitality. Bong Joon-ho's Oscar winning exploration of class distinctions is an entertaining spin on the 'upstairs/downstairs' diptych and is very well made, with an engaging cast, great production values and cinematography and an excellent score. Next only to 2017's 'The Shape of Water', 'Parasite' is the most unusual film ever to take home the Oscars for Best Picture and Director (but deservedly on both counts). Fun and memorable.\n",
      "Being an american it is difficult to know when foregin films are released and how to watch them but this film was a surprise. The picture quality was probably one of the best ive ever seen and really complimented my television. The acting was excellent for such a varied age cast and the story was unique, it kept me guessing and definetley cements South Korea as a movie up an comer in my mind.\n",
      "This should be a nomination for a foreign language Oscar. This is enjoyable and fun but not deserving a 9 or 10. The Asian move \"Farewell \" is a superior movie. This is mostly unbelievable and has a questionable ending sequence but still enjoyable. It is worth seeing and deserves a strong 8 and Oscar consideration.\n",
      "The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade.\n",
      "With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling & acting) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it.\n",
      "All of the watchers can get the idea of the contrast between the families that's for sure. Interesting -not the most interesting- plot works just fine but movie couldn't give me the feeling of emphaty which it tries to give. Rich family was wierd but it doesn't make them the villians. You don't kill people because they don't like your smell and crying in front of the picture of the man you murdered won't be a redemption. Writer tried us to grow sympaty for him but it didn't work for me.This kind of unjustified things pushed me a bit and ending wasn't satisfying that much. Acting and cinematography took credit of my rating. Thanks for reading.\n",
      "Movies have always had a certain point of perspective or a certain ressemblance, but not Parasite. Its like nothing else before, its not only a comedy, its also a horror, drama and a thriller with a great message behind it. The acting is good i feel, but of course i cant tell perfectly because i dont understand Korean. The reason this movie is good is because of its spontaneous and ambiguity. Film writters often do films where they answer all the question in your asking yourself about the story. But in those case, you watch the movie and you dont really think about it afterwards because often those answer are boring or too simple. But in this case, the film is good because it dives into something relatively ordinary but always make you wonder if there is something more to it. The way the events occur are nothing like any other movie. It has a marvelous ending with full of sense. I really like the way the director portrays the simple emotions of life and the class of society. If you are open to new ideas and new way of looking at a story you may like Parasite.\n",
      "The film is funny most of the time but i think they were better films to win the oscar...\n",
      "It's so good for a movie to make me feel like unseeing the movie✌ or maybe if I were a part in the movie plot I wish to change some decisions and actions , I mean to say I am so into this movie, that I can't sleep without thinking for few days.. Korean movies are making me obsessed with fantasy..\n",
      ". . . even more deplorable than the USA under POTUS #45. The Wealth Disparity in South Korea is five or six times worse than America's, if you can imagine that! A tiny fraction of PARASITE \"people\" live like Corrupt Corporate Capitalist\\Communist U.S. CEO's, but the vast majority of the remainder 99 Per Centers struggle for survival in roach-filled hovels deep underground, subject to life-threatening floods of raw sewage during the frequent year-round monsoon rains. It's an absolute ordeal for the ordinary normal average Koreans to keep a set of dry work clothes available in order to perform their low-paid menial jobs for the monied PARASITE Class wallowing in the conspicuous consumption of their ill-gotten Wealth. These work environments are flagrantly unsafe. When employees perish, the Miser Clique dismisses them like squashed bugs and hire replacement victims, complaining all the time about the Smell of Squalor to which they condemn their fellow man. PARASITE concludes just like another 2019 film--JOKER--with the onset of a long overdue Kill-the-Rich Movement.\n",
      "Just watch it people !! I assure you won't regret it. I love it how the film can move you from one state of emotion to another in just a blink of an eye. I laughed, shocked, confused altogether but I enjoyed it. I'm so thrilled watching this. I kinda wanna watch it again while it still in theater.\n",
      "This is not the first movie ever to try and combine 5-6 different genres and be jack of all trades. Each one I've seen so far failed, and this one is no exception... The story is rather simple and movie is simply too long for such simple story. If they made it like, let's say a 90 minutes long gory comedy it would be just fine.  probably worth seeing but definitely not a masterpiece or the best movie of 2019\n",
      "When you set out to watch a foreign film you never know what to expect. And you can only hope that the film will keep you off phone so you don't miss any important subtitles...\n",
      "Parasite takes you on an emotionally gripping storyline, where you will find yourself fixed to your screen for the entirety. The superb directing, and In particular writing style of this screenplay complement to each other and will not disappoint. I was so pleased that the ending of the film ties the rest of the storyline together and really does justice for the rest of the film, cause who likes a bad ending? This film did get a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and it was defiantly deserved.\n",
      "Movie who play with the social ascension all along in the movie. We follow that poor family that integrate a rich family. The movie have a comedy side clearly, sexual content too. The movie was worth to watch. But despite all the struggle to the poor family to avoid his own condition, we can clearly see that their condition will follow them for the rest of their life and they will never be able to rise the social conditon that they are in.\n",
      "The worst film i see in my life. Its boring, horrible, 2 hours of my life lost. I dont know the 8,6 score in imdb.\n",
      "At first it's a bit slow. I had to repeat it again to have a better understanding what it is about. I am glad it's up on Netflix and able to see what this movie is about. Someone recommended it to me last year. Oh boy it's really good. I don't want to keep talking about this and just watch this movie. They deserve all the awards in this film.Watch Burning too. It's really good. A bit similar it's dark as well.I just made a comment so I can leave a review here. 10/10.\n",
      "Truly one of the best movies I've seen so far. A first part which seems quite classic but intriguing, and then a memorable second part that makes us go through all the emotions. An instant classic.\n",
      "I herd good things about this movie but I never expected I would love it so much. It was brilliant. Reminds me of another brilliant movie I just saw JoJo Rabbit. Like JoJo Rabbit that movie's dark humor gets you swept in before hitting you with just pure darkness (although you get a better shining light with Parasite)\n",
      "It's a well done picture. I'm taken away by what a good story about social status is was.\n",
      "Recommend highly\n",
      "I've seen some Korean movies such as \"I saw the Devil\" or \"A Bittersweet Life\" but ths one tops them all. It was the first time, that I felt different feelings for the same movies. I laughed for a scene and 3 minutes later I was grabbed on my seat for the tension.\n",
      "The characters tend a little bit to the stereotype (the naive rich wife, the spoiled children, and the hard working poor family) but enjoyable to watch. You feel attracted to them because you can understand their despair for trying to \"fit in\", especially the younger son.\n",
      "However, I recommend this movie. Beautifully directed, with some nice shots (the last one when the poor father flees after murdering the wealthy father), convincing acting and a interesting subject about societal classes.\n",
      "The only flaw is the characters who have a too stereotypical part but it can be easily forgotten.\n",
      "Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of this year. It's very well directed with a engaging background score, captivating screenplay and stunning cinematography.The film flows through multiple genres from comedy and drama in first half to horror and thriller in second.Story revolves around a impoverished household trying to procure jobs in a wealthy family using unscrupulous methods. Bong-joon-ho deals with more than one philosophical arguments throughout the movie but never loses his focus of the central plot.With masterful direction of Bong-joon-ho, film was able to smoothly transition from a tone of comedy to tragedy effortlessly. Parasite might be his best work to date.\n",
      "This was a breath of freah air, very original. Had no idea what was going to happen next...even till the end. Well acted. Just wish I understood Korean!\n",
      "The most grotesque movie of the Oscar awarded movies I've ever seen...Don't fall into that \"I'm sophisticated because I watch Korean movies\" trap\n",
      "Parasite was such a mesmerizing piece of film. It's storytelling was weird, absurd, unexpected and somehow came together really nicely. It's hard to describe this piece due to how many genre's of film it covers, but throughout the film I've felt like there were multiple layers of metaphors that I was missing. It's not your typical film, that's for sure. All I can say is that you should go in blind, it's worth it.\n",

      "I do feel this movie is really well made. Alot of things worked well and the movie was enjoyable. I liked the mix of humor and darkness. I really enjoyed the actors and the way the movie was put together.I'm still working on what the movie was trying to say.

      "Complicated but beautifully told movie. The struggle for getting a better life for the Kim's (Parasite) family is shown strongly in this movie. Very very good movie. When will Indonesia could make such a movie.\n",
      "Unusual but compelling film. It's a singular triumph of Korean drama.

They do justice to their respective roles. Great script. Great direction.\n",

      "Wow! Brilliant yet with some fragmented story lines. Very funny and then alarmingly dark. Found the violence and over the top change in storyline in the last 1/4 of the film difficult to watch and really disliked it. After, I wish I had not watched this film. Very difficult to rate. I guess I am tired of all the violence. So glad though to see a movie made in South Korea come to the mainstream theater here.\n",
      "Better than 'Birdman', are you out of your mind? The next thing you will say is that this is better than 'Police Academy'? How insulting? I'm not saying this movie is bad, no way. Nor am I saying \"Parasite\" is good either - because it is not. What can I say, I'm waffling all around the middle? The obvious inadvertence to materiality perfectly conjoins with the script's puerile jabber. Scene One stumbles onto screen and swiftly kicks out any semblance of reality. A family unable to butter toast become shifty, successful deadbeats swindling really stupid people out of their livelihood. Talk about poor messaging. Like so many 'Art' movies in the past. It seems designed to entertain only the elite. A kind of movie embraced by a few and soon forgotten by all. If I gave this movie a mediocre score, it would be too high. But it won an Oscar, so that tells me - ahhhh - nothing really.\n",
      "The Screenplay is soooo good.\n",
      "Joon-ho Bong is one of my favorite Directors working right now.\n",
      "An unordinary story which takes you on a journey where you never know where you end up.Somehow South Korea produces so many quality movie its unreal.Great movie, the less you know, the better.And watch Memories of Murder too, imo his best work ;)\n",
      "One of the most exquisitely directed, and well-crafted, films of the decade. Give Joon-ho Bong an Oscar from now!(8.5/10)\n",
      "Perfect script , Ph of the gods , and the direction is is a work of art that combines with the palate of colors that create a great atmosphere.\n",
      "The soundtrack is normal and the characters are great.\n",
      "Damnation on poverty, damnation on class differences, damnation on worldly regret, is money really the standard of human superiority !!! Is it true that the poor man has no religion and does not know God? And does the poor have no mercy on the poor ?! Is the poor more guilty? What a movie I really enjoyed, it was full of concepts, thanks to good South Korean cinema and congratulations\n",
      "I just watched Titanic and this and I saw in both movies how people who has that stupid paper ,WHICH IS CALLED MONEY, look at people who doesn't and it's disgusting. I hated it when in Titanic they put the rich people on the boats and lock the poor people deep down in the ship.\n",

      "\"All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.\"\n",
      "Whilst I loved everything about this film, the best moment for me was the son's plan at the end. Simply summed up, everyone comes to a fork in the road, you can choose the \"easy\" way or the hard way, every choice has trade offs, the easy way can often end up being the hard way, just ask any criminal currently sitting in jail. I liked the son's plan the best over any other plan throughout the movie, but I did not see it coming. Yes some reviews have stated it is a movie about the class divide, but it is more than that. Even the rich are trapped one way or the other, by their choices. Great casting, interesting plot.\n",
      "How come that the girl didn't report to police about the basement after she found her teacher in blood?!\n",
      "Unusual but interesting story with great characters.\n",
      "I'm still uncertain if this is an excellent or just good movie. On the other hand I have no doubts it still keeps my mind busy with its twists, drama, subtle humor and hidden messages.\n",
      "In conclusion:\n",
      "If you like korean filmography you should definitely take the time to watch it.\n",
      "Everything about this film is brilliant: the progressive screenplay, the simplistic production design, the casting and performances, etc. Even the trailer was exciting! A very Oscar-worthy movie.\n",
      "Like many of the Users reviewing this film, I had high hopes when I rented it.I thought it started out well. Unlike some of the reviewers, I kind of liked the family of grifters (especially the daughter). In fact, my initial rating was 10 stars; however, as the movie continued, the stars began to fall by the wayside.If the movie would have been about a family of grifters, who use imaginative ways to imbed themselves into the lives of a rich family, and then develop a storyline from there, this would have been a likeable, if less imaginative, movie. Unfortunately the plot veers significantly away from this by first introducing a weird, and unbelievable character living in a basement fallout shelter, and then, turning violent and bloody for no apparent reason.It's too bad as the movie started out with so much potential and some truly comic scenes (i.e. leaving the windows open for \"free fumigation\" and the little boy's \"surrealistic\" paintings which are nothing more than scribblings).And no, don't tell me that I need to have a better understanding of the socio-economic conditions within modern day Korea to truly appreciate this movie. It's not my job to educate myself in order to appreciate a movie. It's the movie's job to allow me to appreciate it. If it doesn't do that, it's a waste of time.\n",
      "I promise myself i wont get one myself when i'm older, for a good reason.Yes, One might argue there are plausible plot-holes, still the movie is easily one of the best thriller this year.\n",
      "Technically the movie sector is a way of entertainment, and Parasite is a really good example for it.\n",
      "The film has everything! Thrilling adventure, a family drama, dark humor and twisting scenes. In the middle of the movie everything twists and chains you in your chair. Joon-ho Bong put up a really good job. Directed really good. The casting was really good, with the well-played actings and good directing the characters reflected their emotional conditions very good.\n",
      "The one con i can point out about the film is the slightly weak ending. It could've been more emotional, tragedian and exiting.\n",
      "Over all its a really fun movie to watch, infect the best one recently. These kind of movies don't come often.\n",
      "I could not wait to see this film again as soon as I walked out of the theatre!The film making is incredible, script writing is perfection! And the beautifully shot cinematography all blend together to create such a funny, sad and often tense story!\n",
      "Wow... This movie was a masterpiece. Acts, scenes, music, shocking accidents and specially difference between poor people and rich... I always remember this movie. It made me to think about Shop Lifters movie. Thank u all agents. Remarkable movie 👌\n",
      "The sudden uproar at the 95th minute of Parasite, a poignant story about a poor family of four living it up through unfair and illicit means and invisibly enjoying the riches of an affluent family of four living in a tony neighborhood, made me stop sipping from my cup of hot water and stare at it, thinking how can a bunch of people create such a moving film that does not stop at one or two messages but delivers this funny yet sad thing called life in its entirety. TN.\n",
      "This is a good film, but personally it's not the best I've seen recently.\n",
      "I watched this before all the hype exploded and the movie went mainstream and thought nothing much of it at the time. I enjoyed it though, it was a great story and very well made, but didn't think it worthy of all the hype. I went to see it again after all the hullabaloo and didn't really think anything different for the first time. I didn't miss anything and I still 'get' it.There was a little too much slapstick and ridiculousness for me, and the acting was only ok. Kang-Ho Song was definitely the best of the bunch.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" directed by Bong Joon Ho is a fine film about one horrible family taking horrendous advantage of the wealthy Park family, and a strong message to our global culture.I was deeply impressed by this gem of a film, which only strengthens the creative vision of Bong, as well as the fascinating cinema of South Korea.Fantastic direction - Bong Joon Ho is a master at building suspense from simple scenes and shots. Formidable cinematography. A sovereign effort in production design. Deliberate and effective pacing throughout. Taking all this together with a very interesting script and characters, and an excellent film is realised.Highly recommendable.\n",
      "Now it's the time to stop that longing, Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. Since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished. The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie.\n",
      "I had high hopes for this due to the Oscar awards but was left rather disappointed. It was an odd mix of comedy and serious drama with unconvincing characters and a bit of a stupid story at times. Very different but for me fell flat and very overhyped. I've watched much better thought provoking films with good social commentary.\n",
      "Unique,elegant with a different point? The movie is really good and the fact that cleverness is all we need is in this movie. Shows the difference between the rich and the poor in a different way. The last part is quite unsatisfied! But the family got broke both the family ! Greediness has also it's own limit.\n",
      "Usually I don't like movies, where i have to read subtitles, because movie is in foreign language, but in this case - i have to say - all in this movie was perfect - actors, directors work, writers...in these 2hours and 12 minutes i was excited to see how the movie will end up.\n",
      "And I'm glad to say and knew, that this is Oscar winning movie.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho have to make a lot of new movies to our next generation.\n",
      "Just as a flatworm or a tapeworm enters the human body unnoticed, stay in the stomach and starts multiplying to damage the human internal system, a poor family becomes a parasite to a rich peaceful family.The concept of humans being parasites is superbly told through incredible cinematography, editing and background score.\n",
      "I watched this film not expecting much but the way it developed a sense of dread and anxiety crept in.\n",
      "The film masterfully builds up and quietly holds the underlying tension and by the end it explodes in everyone's face leaving you gasping for air having held it for a longest time wondering what will happen next.\n",
      "I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged.\n",
      "And my mind was blown when the third act went bongkers haha.\n",
      "I watched this film 3 weeks ago. And still trying to figure out what it all meant.\n",
      "Don't miss it.\n",
      "So well crafted and shaped that it can at times feel a little obvious. It is a very good film and has something to say, an important message for our times.\n",
      "Ok I get it. It was original. Foreign films often get more attention from film critics just because they're foreign. There were some truly original thoughts in the plot. Some parts were comical. Some were more graphic than a real horror movie.Most importantly what the hell happened to the love affair between the tutor & student?? That was never addressed.There were several parts that had no relevance even later in the film.\n",
      "Le film commence pour la comédie, tout d'un coup Pour la tragédie et terminé de manière romantique.\n",
      "I've been watching Korean movies for more than 10 years. The only people who think this was a great movie are people who have never seen a Korean movie.South Korean movies are edgier and smarter than anything Hollywood produces.\n",
      "Parasite:\n",
      "There was no class discrimination in this movie. What I saw was a bunch of pariahs preying on a very trusting, very naive family, ignorant to the plot unfurling at their expense. These people ruined the livelihood of nice people who had job security. They lied to this family. And the family paid the price.As for the man who held his nose, wasnt the parasitic family in raw sewage the night before? That said this movie will keep you in suspense. But again it's not the best Korean movie I have ever seen.If you want to see a good korean movie watch The Man from Nowhere or Handphone. or A Company Man. You can watch Oldboy or Mother. These movies are all available on prime. You to see how parasite pales in comparison to just his hand for the movies. Hollywood, take note.\n",
      "Parasite has been on my watchlist for about a year now. I went in with exceptionally high expectations, given the glowing reviews and high ratings. Having watched it earlier today, I can confidentially say, it was the most disappointing movie I have watched, so much so, I felt the need to write a review. It's a movie that simply doesn't live up to its hype whatsoever. Not only is it a poor representation of the class divide that exists in many parts of the world, portraying a lower class family in a degrading and deceitful way, but most if not every scene that was meant to be suspenseful, was just outright anti climatic, to the point where I was like \"oh... is that it\". To make things worse, the movie was 2 hours long! 2 hours that I will never get back.\n",
      "If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham, then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise. However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones.Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh.\n",
      "I must say this movie is so good. It make you laugh and then cry. Being an indian i watched this movie with the english subtitle. I love it !!!!!!\n",
      "They way the story runs it catches your attention more and more.\n",
      "Very funny movie, fast paced, nice aesthetics\n",
      "relatable plot\n",
      "The film is Evolutionary. It destroys all the backgrounds we have of the The film is destructive. It destroys all the backgrounds we have of the rich and rich classes of society and gives us a gray experience of both. The script has bugs that can be ignored (such as when the father goes into the basement in the end but doesn't see his injured son in front of him). Breaking the old cycle of good and evil is the hard and valuable work that Joon-ho Bong does well.\n",
      "The Park family is the epitome of riches. The Kim's dwell in a subbasement and live off of assembling pizza boxes. By sheer fate, these two families are brought together. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik) and his sister (Park-So-dam), the Kim children , gets the unexpected opportunity to get work as an English tutor and an art therapist for the Park family children. Unbeknownst to the wealthy family, the Kim's father is hired as chauffeur to the aloof businessman Mr. Park, while Ki-Woo realizes he can, by hook and crook, get his own mother hired to fill a newly opening for housekeeper. The Kim's are providing services while the Parks become the whole bankroll for the parasitic Kim family. The golden opportunity becomes unsteady when underhanded dominance raises its head.Bong Joon-ho's tragicomedy is nearly flawless and deserves its many awards highlighted by the Golden Globes and Oscars. PARASITE makes the Silver Screen a remarkable experience.\n",
      "I realized that the family's plot to replace all employees of the rich family when they plan to replace the driver. So the rest of movie is expected. Then the basement secret is really a surprise. Wish the ending can be more touching. Parasite: is the poor family or the rich family?\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie on the big screen!The suspense of an entire family trying to weasel their way into service of a rich family is just the top layer of this movie about life choices, social class and the depths of what you're willing to do for your family.\n",
      "This was may first time to watch Korean movie.\n",
      "I think this is a modern and national unique movie.\n",
      "Many scene reflect Korean social problem, for example disparity, diplomaism and so on . Because of these, this movie could be a unique, not following American ones.So i can assent on that this was awarded Oscar, one of the most authoriative movie award.This is not related to evaluation, i noticed that Korean people use english in their daily conversation more frequently than Japanese.\n",
      "I heard that the importance of English is acknowledged in Korea recently, so many parents make their child to learn English in his childhood.\n",
      "I guess that these condition appeared in this movie.\n",
      "Just another black humor Korean movie. There are much better Korean Movie's. Don't waste your time on this one.\n",
      "Masterpiece across all human emotions,\n",
      "Insightful at every level\n",
      "Parasite is my second korean movie after oldboy and i have fallen in love with this country.parasite is the kind of moveis you will never forget the soundtrack , the cenimatography all amazing.\n",
      "I am shocked! Really wonderful film and it is not american. Thank you, Korea, but the ending was meh, that's why i give 9 stars.\n",
      "The movie revolves around two family with totally different social and economical status , the movie shows how patriarchy works on society.but leaves a question who is parasite the people who r from lower catagory of this society who works for higher catagory people as they need money , but at the same time , the people who is on upper side they also can't live their live smoothly if poor people don't provide them service .moreover full of surprising twists and turns with a pinch of comedy but talks about a deep rooted issue in society .\n",
      "OK nice film but not the best of the year and also not deserving that much award. I think the story is childish and boringly exaggerated. 7 is the exact point it deserves.\n",
      "Really mundane and heartfelt until it's not! Exhilarating, edge of your seat thriller!\n",
      "South Korea's leading filmmaker Bong Joon-ho (Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother) shows off his flair and skill once again with his latest entry Parasite. This is an enormously evocative film which creates (and leaves behind) various moods and atmospheres on its way through the inventive, but nevertheless fairly predictable plot which twists and turns in somewhat gimmickry ways. Watching Parasite for the first time is like watching a really clever movie for the second time: you know what will unfold, but you're still quite amazed by the audacity and skill of the presentation. Whether or not you enjoy Parasite on a meta-level, however, will arguably depend on to what degree you make any use of Bong Joon-ho's dab at East-Asian social classes anno 2019. These are not arguments that present themselves logically; they are offered through the absurd behaviour of the movie's two conflicting families - none of whom are sympathetic, even though Mr. Bong ultimately asks us insistently to care for them.\n",
      "Well made movie but i suspect there are a lot of phony reviews posted here to gain an Oscar win. I liked the acting and story line.\n",
      "However there needs to be some redemption (despite the political statement of classism).\n",
      "Cruelty can be a means to develop a plot into something more transcendent. I didn't grasp any of that, just a descent into hell.\n",
      "Too much over the top sensationalism.\n",
      "This film tell us about movie is not about budget, but we (filmmaker) can run with idea\n",
      "Thought provoking, self reflective, socio economic critique. Highly entertaining film that mixes genre styles or tropes giving a wholesome movie watching experience.\n",
      "The agony of poverty and class inferiority is the raging theme of Parasite. At first, knowing the title of the film and the directors previous films i thought this was going to be a \"Apocalyptic virus outbreak\" kind of film, But it turns out a metaphor for the plot of the story - A poor family finds a rich family and slowly becomes a part of their house and their life and in the end the parasite does what a parasite does.\n",
      "Wow! I can't understand how or why this excellent film can be compared to ROMA. This is pure gold. Roma was bad in a lot of aspects, bad acting, bad rythm, history/screenplay, etc. Even using a great camera such as Alexa 65 was a great disappointment. Now, this film Parasite is in every area a superb film. We need more movies like this!!!\n",
      "This is the best film of 2019 so far for Korean cinema. Casting was superb with good story.\n",
      "I gave it 8 because poor family didn't look poor and also for the last part where his son become successful in a minute.\n",
      "Overall its a good film to watch.\n",
      "Enjoy Watching....\n",
      "The film is perfect especially I checked twice the sence which the rain destroy the Home of Poor family and they did not have any place to go but in the Other hand for rich people the rain just make the weather better and the day after rain when Rich mother go to the city with poor driver she said : it is just blue Sky after rain night . the camera show a shot in Poor driver eyes who lost all his house because of the rain.\n",
      "all people who involve making this movie ... thank you\n",
      "we are waiting for another movie from you\n",
      "After watching movies Please say that it is not normal. Have all the emotions Not like general movies If listening to it from Korea, it will be fun to watch. Worth the ticket to see\n",
      "Beautifully written and very masterfully crafted, definitely one of the best Korean movie of this year\n",
      "But the biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on excellent performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable and cheating, with deceit,overall performing is immersing rich families. Until the emergence of another parasitic family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot. The final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, made me feel suffocated.\n",
      "I am happy people are giving a try to foreign-language films, but I couldn't consider this a masterpiece: The film is boring, predictable , the characters are really not interesting, and they made a really dramatic mood to make an obvious message, I don't see any necessity of exaggerating such a simple meaning. The rich and the poor cliché\n",
      "How courteous is the Japanese\n",
      "He always says 'excuse it, please'\n",
      "He walks into his neighbour's garden\n",
      "And smise and says 'I beg your pardon'\n",
      "He bows, and grins a little grin\n",
      "And brings his hungry family in\n",
      "He grins, and bows a little bow\n",
      "'So sorry, this MY garden now'.That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable.\n",
      "The film is not bad, it opened the way for me to the world of features of South Korean cinema. but I can't give it 10/10. I expected a lot more from a film with such a buzz around it and four Oscars, two of them for \"best Director\" and \"best film\". the idea and message are clear, but I'm only talking about the first hour of the movie. somewhere in the middle of the story begins to gain momentum incomprehensible to me, and the genre of the film changes in the opposite direction. the ending of the film is no less strange. apparently, these are the features of South Korean cinema that I could not understand, alas. I put this film 8/10 and believe that it received this rating from me as undeservedly as its 4 Oscars.. .\n",
      "I don't understand why this movie has received so much praise. I don't know the technical details of the movies, but this movie got 4 Oscars, 4 Oscars! The script was not top-notch, although sometimes surprising things happened while watching it. The acting was not outstanding either. I really don't understand what this movie has that can get 4 Oscars. Maybe it's my ignorance. I was very disappointed when the movie ended, my expectations were very high. The ending was not satisfying at all. Only unexpected things happened and the movie ended in a mess. This movie has the characteristics of an average movie. There's nothing legendary about it.\n",
      "This movie is damn ...#masterpiece#fun#darkcomedy#oneofthebestmovie# ........such a different concept 💡 ✨ 😍\n",
      "This movie deserves every bit of attention it has got. Parasite is a surreal experience of luxury, scheming, and deception. I can not wait to see what Bong Joon-Ho has for us next.\n",
      "Well watched it on Amazon Prime. It's clearly a story on Survival, Greed and Realisation. It's a one time watch not worth Oscar , sometimes its too funny to understand on what basis do the Oscars decided on Best Movie\n",
      "One of the most amazing movie. Those who don't like they don't know about the inside picture of the movie. great job by team.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" (2019) is a masterpiece cinematic work created by South Korean director Bong Joon Ho. The film became the first South Korean work to be awarded the Palme d'Or, the Main Prize of the Cannes Film Festival, and also won four Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Original Screenplay.The plot of \"Parasite\" tells about two families from different social strata, whose lives are intertwined together when one of the families starts working for the other. Through sharp social commentary and unexpected turns of events, the film explores themes of class differences, social injustice and human nature.One of the most impressive aspects of \"Parasite\" is its deep and multifaceted script, which explores complex aspects of human psychology and social dynamics. The film skillfully switches between different genres, from black comedy to tragic drama, which makes it fascinating and unpredictable for the viewer.Director's m.\n",
      "Super movie of all time in the day of corona.this movie is having a good storyline also have some great amazing scane that make us totally amazed.\n",
      "It's describing our society these days. You can enjoy it and giving you a new perspective about how lifes in world works. The plot was spectacular with some twist, giving you a stage of excitement about what will happen in the next second.\n",
      "Storytelling is one of the most important elements of a good movie, and parasite is a perfect example. From the beginning we see everything wrong with the lifestyle of our main characters. We follow their individual character arcs through to the end. This is a complex movie with many subplots and ideas with deep symbolism, yet I was never confused or overwhelmed. Fantastic worldview with such a great developing plot with such interesting elements every scene.\n",
      "Dramatic, okay. I don't understand the motive behind the movie & the plot . The scene was alright. Okay movie just the same 👍\n",
      "This is definitely worth a watch. I think this film is going to be a catalyst for an appreciation of foreign films given the Academy Award. For us that are accustomed to foreign films, this film the the type of quality we generally expect and I personally wasn't blown away but I do believe that it's important this film won Best Picture(especially given where we are culturally). This film is actually an easy access as well as a great starting point if you want to go down the wormhole and discover even greater foreign gems!\n",
      "While i watch movies i want to get immersed and not THINK about symbolism, so for me the exploring of the topic of class differences didn't offer much new for me. Even though the characters weren't in a black or white scheme, i didn't felt connected to something real and the main deceit plot was not that engaging.\n",
      "So its about certain rich people dehumanizing poor people, this was not enough new there for me.This movie could be more for movie lovers who are into artistic shots,novel characters and symbolism.\n",
      "A huge disappointment. Had the film ended after the first hour, it would deserve 8*. Like this, it is a tasteless hodgepodge.\n",
      "The story is so well balanced between the two families, that you can't even tell who the lead actors or the supporting ones are. It is also one of those very few movies which don't have a Hero-Villain storyline. The way it dealt with social discrimination and flaws in human nature is beyond extraordinary. It clearly explains why it is only the third film in history to win both the Palme d'Or and Academy Award for Best Picture. A rare masterpiece indeed.\n",
      "This is a well written and well performed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.\n",
      "The trailer to this movie does not give anything away, and that makes me super happy because wow, this movie caught me off guard. Beautiful cinematography, intense moments and a great cast. Also I need a bowl of ram-don... NOW!\n",
      "This director is one of the best in Korea, one of how many jewels more than this is the best of all. Memories of a killer or the host are also very good. In addition to the way it is carried in whether several generos as a comedy moment, suspense, tension is a unique expectancy.\n",
      "This movie lives up to the hype. It's a work of art. Every single element is perfect. Must watch!!\n",
      "Finally a movie comes what matches Hollywood's standards of cinematography and direction # Ideally a very simple tale of a struggling family trying to make ends meet thru a con job when desperation becomes the hour & that goes horribly wrong at the end # but what makes or let Parasite deserve the Best Oscar Movie award is the drama that unfolds in each of these characters justified to their suitable roles , epic dialogues and role play give a definite meaning to the film , but what Boong John Hoo could have done is continued the timeline after the climax unfolds since he stretched it this far to get the message of class divide thru a comical yet satirical approach thru a con family trying to meet ends and justified the true purpose of the movie , that backstabbing in the climax got a bit too far and took away the message of the film and instead the previous climax when it rains showed the true perspective, should have continued with that & with the character of Kang Ho Song proving his loyalty and finding out the true thief in the end and make it thrilling with a twist with still ends to meet like they ended up where they started at the grave end of things # Beautiful Movie shows a degree in Direction of Cinema does hold weightage # So ideally it's nice publicity for a Foreign Film to win the Oscar to gain worldwide audience and throw light on a different culture as this year I dunno Hollywood couldn't live up to its directorial concepts despite big names , Well done Bong Joon Ho could have ended up well and more insightful had it thrown light on other subjects in the city but certainly a great attempt # Korea @ Parasite #\n",
      "Impressive, uncomfortable, a masterpiece.\n",
      "at times you can feel the smell that the moments emanate\n",
      "There is a scene where the family sits for a drink in the house, they break a glass and spill food every where on the floor, but when the owner of the house arrives, they manage to clean everything and shoves it under the table..and luckily no one notices. Actually they are all drunk and manage to leave the floor spick and span without using the vaccum cleaner.. not really the best director..the movie was awesome though..\n",
      "I walked out near the end of the movie.\n",
      "I highly recommend you don't spend time and money on it\n",
      "It made me very uncomfortable watching two hours of people scamming other people (and worse) for personal gain.\n",
      "Yes, you see that in movies all the time, but this one simmered in cruelty in slow motion...surrounded by beautiful people and sets.\n",
      "I didn't like ANY of the characters in the movie and that is hard to do\n",
      "I felt a hollow sadness when I left\n",
      "Maybe because it had a lot of \"10's\" or maybe it is a reflection of what society thinks is a good film.\n",
      "The only redeeming quality I saw was that the Korean people are sweeter than us , like 1950's bad guys in suits.\n",
      "Visually out of this world, Parasite is a very captivating film to watch. The artistry of Bong Joon-ho carries profound storytelling from beginning to end, rich of deep metaphors and allegories. This tragic but powerful and timeless cinematic masterpiece creates a beautiful but dark aesthetic, relaying heavy on the theme of inequality.\n",
      "It has everything. It's funny, it's sad and it will make you fuming. You will feel with all the characters. The ending had me for a while; at the end it gives you another type of twitst. A very good movie. 8/10\n",
      "Winner of four Oscars, Palme d'Or 2019 and Best Foreign Motion Picture at the Golden Globes, Parasite boldly attempts satire about Seoul's haves and have-nots.The South Korean film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay. It has also made cinema history by becoming the first foreign language film to win Best Picture\n",
      "Parasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits - a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants.\n",
      "Definitely not the greatest film ever made but pretty damn close. The cinematography is consistently amazing, all the performances are incredible even the child actor who plays Park Dasong isn't that bad. Screenplay is very impressive despite the fact that the pacing of the second act feels a little bit boring. Really impressively implemented social commentary because it's really subtle. Mr Kim's motivation for killing Mr Park makes sense as you can see the distain me feels for the Parks in his earlier performance and it obviouslt comes to a head when Kijung is stabbed. The conclusion felt a little messy but was effective, but probably could have done without the \"flash-forward\" sequence. Overall incredible 10/10.\n",
      "The movie is great movie, unique and exciting. I just think it was too hyped up. I believe this is first time Americans saw Korean Thriller. That could be the reason it won so many Oscars. I can name several other Korean movie with actually same Actor in it, that are better movies. Don't get me wrong this was great movie and I really really enjoyed it but the way every single person made it into the greatest movie they've see ...well it's not or probably those people haven't seen enough videos. It's fun and exciting movie it's a must watch for any movie lover.\n",
      "This story contrasts the living status of two Korean families due to differences in their earnings. The movie is set in metropolitan, therefore does not show distinct Korean culture. The drama is comedic, but not much of a thriller. The film is a good-watch but overrated.\n",
      "Slack in the plot and the blurring of the overall message, which is quite understandable, but weakly beaten, leave the attentive viewer with a number of questions rather than viewing satisfaction. However, the series may be of interest to the work of artists and actors, and can also be useful as a first step in getting acquainted with Korean cinema (although for many it has already been overtaken by Parasite in this regard).\n",
      "This is ok ok for me... If u like that type of movies then watched Trapped (bollywood) movie.\n",
      "A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the \"good guys\" or the \"bad guys\" at any given point during the movie.This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category.\n",
      "While I myself did not love this movie like other people I have to say this film is so smart on so many levels. It is beyond anything I may ever be able to do. While I may have not loved it liked some other people I still think this is truly one of the greatest movies of the year. 9/10\n",
      "Dark and humorous with an unexpected turn of events.I think one of the best things about Parasite is that for a foreign film it doesn't feel like a foreign film. At least in my experience foreign films always felt somewhat polarizing like either you watched them or you didn't and I feel like this movie is a good starting point. It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn't expect it to be that way.I highly recommend watching.\n",
      "It did start off a little slow (or maybe it was me getting used to watching a movie with subtitles for once) and I had no idea what to expect from this movie. But man I did not expect the direction this movie takes at many moments. I found myself jaw dropping, laughing and over all just adoring the choises that were made during the production of this masterpiece.\n",
      "Funny. with a great twist . I will totally watch it again.\n",
      "Such a great and funny movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. This kind of movies makes me happy!\n",
      "It breaks the stereotypes of hollywood of course,It's a breathe of fresh air.\n",
      "I think it's the fatigue of the audience with hollywood movies that helped it with the hype,Globalisation played its part as well to win them oscars.\n",
      "I think their incentive was well-deserved as i haven't seen many good movies this year or movies that are built of unconventional values.\n",
      "4 oscars? 4? For what? This is what you get when you falsly sue real movie makers and let amateurs work. I'm shocked seeing thos mediocre movie gets such praise. Did we truly lost our minds? This just shows how political everything got. 4 oscars for this? This is average B production movie. It is not comoplete garbage, but 4 oscars. You lost your mind.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best films in 2019 and the trailer goes in a completely different direction and does not spoil the whole film.\n",
      "Will always remember the first time I saw Parasite in the cinema! A complete jolt awake - totally unexpected, electric storytelling brought together by masterful direction and acting. A thrill to watch.If for any reason you still haven't seen this masterpiece, don't read any reviews and just go watch it. It is best enjoyed without knowing anything beforehand !\n",
      "I was hearing so many good things about Parasite in December before the Oscar win but after it won the Oscar I knew I had to watch Parasite and boy was it a great experience. All the characters are fleshed out Bong Joo did a great job with the direction, the cinematography is top notch, acting awesome. The class divide story and the plot twist at some point (I won't tell you when go watch the movie) was all a great critique of the poor vs the rich and how they view each other. This film didn't necessarily have any heroes or villains just poor and rich and sometimes both sides are evil.\n",
      "A fantastic dark comedy with unpredictable twists and turns.\n",
      "All actors and director both done great work i can't explain\n",
      "Parasite tells a quite surreal story which could absolutely happen. The characters are realistic, I liked how nobody is a clear good guy or bad guy. On the other side maybe you need to be the part of Korean culture to fully appreciate it, but for me it didn't hold that emotional drama that many other viewers liked. It wasn't that funny in the comedic scenes, and other than the social cass divide which is seen in many other movies it wasnt really deep either. Overall a good movie, but did not deserve the oscars it got, especially considering Jojo Rabbit was another contender for best picture, and in my opinion blew out Parasite from the water in every regards\n",
      "The plot of this film is captivating. The cinematography is simply amazing. I'll be watching this title several times a year.\n",
      "I found this film to be trying to cover too much time in one film. You cannot convey depth and soul in such a rush. It was a check list of trying to be quirky, deep, etc. It did not work. I previously saw 3iron and that blew me away. This film has a very high score and I do not understand why. It is overtly formulaic. No character is given enough time to become anything you can relate to really. It is a hurry and that does not work for something like this. It is like Indie film for mainstream mind. I was not moved by it.\n",
      "This movie was really good. I loved the whole plot of it. It has a really good plot twist in the end. I really hope we get a sequel.\n",
      "This has to be the best movie I have ever seen. The performances of every actor and actress is absolutely amazing. The plot of the this film is amazing and the ending leaves it open to what could happen in the future. It is a great mixture of comedy and thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I found myself being sad that it was over when it was done. This will definitely not be a waste of your time and if you do not watch it you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.\n",
      "I just couldn't expect to this. Brilliant and captivating. Deserves every damn prize\n",
      "I like the film but some scenes are kinda wird for me. But I think you should definitely see it\n",
      "This movie literally has it all and you're hooked within first 2 minutes a cinema masterpiece can't wait to see what's next\n",
      "This movie had a lot going for it. It was a great mix of dark humor and social commentary. The premise of a lower class family rising above their station by working (well, conning) their way into the lives and home of an upper class family was an interesting one. But the movie took a real left turn about halfway through. I get that the director had a broader story to tell here, but the tonal shift felt far too jarring for the film to be cohesive to me. It's like I went from watching one movie to watching a completely different movie. Going from humor and intrigue to being downright depressing came across like a bait and switch, not that it was the director's intent for this. But as a viewer, I was left frustrated that I never got to see the second half of the movie that I thought I had begun to watch.It's not a bad film overall, but be prepared to get the good vibes knocked out of you and be left with a downer of a story.\n",
      "Worst movie EVER. Cannot believe how the hell this movie have got 8,6 in rating. Use your time to something more valueable.\n",
      "It feels nice seeing a movie that's not in english from time to time. Nice, original, served it's purpose, but we won't talk about that. I like that they didn't insist on the love story between the childs, that's cringe. Here are two scenes that worth a mention, I believe: The scene where they finally got some nice food at home but they cut the stake with scissors. Nice scene, well thought. The other one is when the fat irritaiting woman tried to climb the stairs and the other fat irritaiting woman welcomes her with a \"THIS IS SPARTA\" kick. LOL\n",
      "Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen! \"You've never seen a movie quite like X.\" Such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it's impossible to be taken seriously, like how too many major new movies are gifted the m-word: masterpiece. So how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly, brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory? And what do we do when we see an actual \"masterpiece\" in this era of critics crying wolf? Especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren't needed? I'll do my best because Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. Just trust me on this one.\n",
      "Best movie i had ever watched.Good Concept 😇\n",
      "I like the way they potrai their roles quite Excellent\n",
      "Wowowowow, this is one of the best films I watched in a while. It was well crafted and the acting was great.It made a really good showcase of social divides across different classes and the extremes that one will go to in desperation. It also showed how the rich think of the poorer proletariat as less than, shown through the odour comments throughout the film, it is this lack of respect that lead to the patriarch's murderous actions.I feel like the house also represented the aforementioned divides in society, the basement representing the lower class and the place of desperation, originally used to hide from loan sharks and after used to hide from the police. Above the basement, the rich family lives, literally above, which could be seen as a metaphor for the place they hold in society, towering above those who are less fortunate. This is a theme, repeated again when the protagonist's house being so low down, is flooded by the torrential rain, whereas the Park's house isn't affectedThe shifting of the film's tone from an upbeat, fun atmosphere (reminiscent of a bank heist film, e.g. Ocean's 11), to a dark sombre tone was powerful. It also presented the unforeseen consequences that can occur when these people are pushed to the extremes. You could also argue that it was the greed of Ki-Taek's family that dealt them this fate, their lack of empathy and consideration when causing the other people to lose their jobs is what started this, however I'm of the opinion that this whole situation was the symptom of a greater issue, wealth inequality. If the state pension system was better perhaps the Geun-Sae wouldn't have had to stay in that basement for so long. If the Park family weren't in a bubble, perhaps Ki-Taek's father wouldn't have snapped. If there was another way to get employment, Ki-Taek's wouldn't have had to resort to greed and forgery to get money. All these things could have been prevented through a better social support structure, perhaps this is the message of the movie.This film was quite poignant and I believe it really achieved its goal of showing how the less fortunate, people on the fringes of society have to live, what lengths they are driven to, perhaps some people will never understand but this film certainly made a great effort.I'm not surprised at all that this film won best picture, it's a unique film and the soundtrack is powerful too, might I add.\n",
      "I couldn't help but laugh at the gullible rich family when the poor underdogs manipulated them and got jobs in their house. The second half is a great thriller. The movie has many twists that will leave you baffled. I don't want to spoil it for you. It is a must watch .\n",
      "There's a lot to Parasite. A very complex story, only a few sets, but dozens of strands.In some ways, it's a very good film. For example, the imagery is outstanding. Also, it's one of the most original films I have ever seen. I never guessed what was going to happen next. I was completely surprised remarkably often. Bit this also brings with it a negative. So much happens that the film started to drag for me. I noticed I was getting restless and was genuinely grateful when the film ended.The acting is good for the most part, but occasionally reaches theatrical heights, which felt tonaly wrong.Overall, I'm glad I watched it.\n",
      "In the opening scene the family is underground where is sad and dark=(povert), as Kim's family moves toward they move in to the light=(hope,wealth), how ever when the things fall apart, light disappeared and the family moves back to darkness, the final shot reflects the firts one but now is way more darker. Also when the rain star they ran many stairs signifying that they are going back to where they come from. And also in the begging the dad said he hates cockroaches but at the end he becomes one.\n",
      "I watched dozens of Korean and Japanese or Chinese movies. I am aware that to fully enjoy them, you need to understand the culture of the country and you can't just judge it, based on your own culture.\n",
      "Keeping this in mind, I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. My ex and my friend considered it \"boring\", but they usually don't appreciate subtle storytelling.I wouldn't say that the movie is boring. Parts of it reminded me of Bin Jip (the parasite aspect of living in someone else's house or family), a small part reminded me of the family in \"The Host\".I understand that the movie is about money, about social class, etc. That being said, I do feel the movie is a tad overrated. It is by no means a bad film, I did enjoy watching it, especially how good the family is at conning the family so easily and how blind their \"host\" family is to their true intentions (take for example that the youngest son actually did notice the morse code and could have prevented things, but his father or mother are so distant from their own son, they didn't even bother to check his Indian tent).This is a typical Palm d'Or movie, like Suzhou River. It rewards the patient viewer, but will bore those with short attention spans who can't appreciate subtlety. Personally, I think \"The Wailing\" is a far better Korean movie anr \"Brotherhood\" the best I saw so far. Parasite is good, but those who know Korean cinema will see that although good, this movie is barely above (Korean) average (which says a lot about the high quality of Korean cinema though).\n",
      "The part where the dude was in the bunker killed me. I was shaken and did not expect it to do that. Anyway, watch it.\n",
      "This was an amazing film, from the metaphor of the American dream to the tiny details in lighting and cinematography it was wonderful. every scene looked amazing, everything was where it needed to be and the framing was wonderful. i don't believe the son ever managed to buy the Park's house, the distance between the two classes was just too big.\n",
      "These movie is LESSON and the movie is filled with spectacular actor's please do watch movie you will really enjoyed... Finally thanks to DIRECTOR and PRODUCERS for these PHENOMENAL movie.. Only one word.. AWESOME\n",
      "The film Parasite follows the story of a South Korean family living day to day in desperate measures to find steady work but by sheer luck and manipulative tactics they are able to find work with a family who are living their dream life of riches. This Tragicomedy captivates you till the very end and that's a rarity in today's era without the blinding use of CGI and fast paced super hero movies. I thought maybe the Oscars were hyping this movie up but it truly deserved all the awards it got and shows true craftsmanship in its screenplay, cinematography, character development, acting, and so much more.\n",
      "This movie shocked you Avery moment. Story is very power full.\n",
      "A poor family doesn't have jobs because they have no educational diplomas. And the reason why they have no diplomas is that they are too poor to afford them.The movie comes to the climax when the dismissed nanny comes back and exposes the basement. Ah, it's always like this that the poor try their best to pretend they are rich, like parasites. The mother says,\" the rich are kind because they are rich.\" But actually, they don't think so. From the moment that they hear even their clothes are thought to carry smells, they have been cheating themselves.The most frustrating plot for me is that the hostess compliments the sunny weather while the family loses their home in a flood.\" Thanks to the rain\", she says.To a degree, I like the ending. The father hides in the basement and starts another parasite life.\n",
      "It's a nice movie overall. I personally like this type of movie; it has the elements that I like, e.g. the contrast between the poor and the rich- their different living conditions and lifestyles. However, I would like to see more locations rather than just between the two places where the two families live. I would also like to see more interactions between those in the underground hiding and those living in the house, something like The Hidden Face, with more suspense and a better twist.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is perfect in every aspect, from its themes and plot to its title, which has a deep meaning. It's another great work from Bong Joon-ho.\n",
      "Good movie but it wasn't a good choice to win an oscar\n",
      "This movie starts out well, with a rather humorous idea for the storyline, a family of grfiters insinuates themselves into a well today household by lying and deception. Then the movie influence perhaps by Quentin Tarantino films, disintegrates into a grisly ending of murder at a child's birthday party. Some are trying to exalt, including the Academy of Arts, into something symbolic and important. Frankly, it comes across to me as sadistic violence as a form of enjoyment. Sorry I went. Maybe they should call it 'the Academy of Deviants' because they seem to like those kinds of films best!\n",
      "It's hard to explain for me... at first I think it's only comedy movie but at last, it showed me I was wrong. I said to myself I liked this movie..and also scared of it..\n",
      "It was interesting movie of real life. This is my first Korea movie ,so I think it good.\n",
      "Every aspect that makes a \"great\" movie, this film has. I could not find a fault, no matter how hard I tried. \"Perfection\".\n",
      "To be honest, I didn't know where this film was headed halfway through but I must say I was surprised in the best way. The mix of genres the underlying tones of survival of the fittest and class was outstanding. A must watch.\n",
      "I saw this on Hulu and I must say this was definitely worthy of all the critical (haven't seen 1917 and loved Once Upon a time in Hollywood and JoJo Rabbit; 2019 was a verynice movie year)/commercial success it has achieved. Most Americans don't bother with foreign language but hopefully this will help to alleviate that. The melding of differing genres kept me intrigued for the duration, definitely worth watching again!\n",
      "Moive tell about different between poor and rich people status how rich people think about the poor peopleThis moive great and masterpiece 👍Watch moive with family also.\n",
      "The beginning of the movie is so fictional and if you keep watching you don't regret.\n",
      "Very original story with a lot of symbolism...but I was expecting more of a plot twist based on critic reviews. I also struggled with reading English sub-titles while trying to follow actors emotions...found it distracting. Maybe it's one of those films like Inception that requires several viewings...except Inception was waaaay better :)\n",
      "I really enjoyed this movie it was funny at times and the characters where great it was a bit gory near the end but that was alright the acting was great also it deserved the four Oscars it got including Best Picture so I would definitely recommend this to any one the best foreign film I've seen.\n",
      "This movie was engaging and even suspenseful at times. The acting and directing are both very well done. But, the ending is over-the-top pathetic. Had I known, I wouldn't have invested 2 hours of my life for an utterly useless contribution to anything good. Pass. Save your 2 hours of life. Go for a walk. Rewatch Dumb and Dumber - you'll feel smarter than after wasting time on this attempt at a ground breaking movie. The Oscar win proves that Hollywood is morally bankrupt and void of ideas.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I feel like I could turn off the sound on my TV and just watch everything visually unfold. Everything from the camera's perspective is just beautiful.\n",
      "With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il) as the film rapidly moves from one plot point to another. It results in a gripping yet poignant watch. The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.\n",
      "Very captivating movie, will keep you on the top of your chair at each moment.\n",
      "If you liked Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, then you'll definitely enjoy this South Korean masterpiece. (Note Mr Trump: in Korean with subtitles, but easy to follow subtitles!)\n",
      "I don't want to add any spoilers, so I'm restricting my comments.\n",
      "This is a story of a poor, struggling clever family that manage to inveigle their way into a wealthy family's life. The plot goes well until...\n",
      "This is a great film, it made me laugh, it made me think, it surprised me continuously. All the actors are consistently real and interesting. The story line progresses nicely and then hits with a number of surprises that I did not expect. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and do not want to say more that might give away any of the interesting twists that occur. It has been well reviewed by many and should do well in the theaters.\n",
      "A surprisingly interesting plot showing the sides of the life of poor people. It describes what a person is capable of for the sake of a good life. An unexpected ending that makes you believe in the best, but do not relax and go to your goal.\n",
      "It was a good drama movie with some comedy mixed in with it. I thought the ending was far fetched but it still was a powerful ending. Amazing acting!!\n",
      "I had all the feels while watching this movie. It expresses the brutal reality in the most surreal yet real form. One of the best movies of the decade and the acting was superb. Personally I would prefer more storyline explained for ex; how did the family become so rich, where did the poor family come from, what kind of a childhood they had etc in order to understand the psychology behind the actions of the characters. Maybe if it was a mini-series it would have been a better idea!? But as I said it's my personal opinion. Overall my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the movie. 8.5\n",
      "A brilliant must see, combined with Ho's direction, the script he co-wrote with Han, the performances of the cast, Jung's score, Hong's cinematography, Yang's editing, Lee's production design, Cho's set decoration, Choi's costume design, action sequences and visual, the story and world in which Parasite explores proves that without a doubt it rightfully won the Oscar for Best Picture of 2019 and stands as one of the absolute best films of the 2010s!!!\n",
      "(The article involves spoilers)\"Parasites\" released last year is a seemingly ordinary and profoundly won the Palme d'Or masterpiece.There are some intriguing scenes in the movie, which is the episode where father Kize stabs President Park when his daughter loses too much blood. Indeed, a person who seems to be easy-going, why did he start killing at this juncture? Moreover, there is no sign of anger before the murder, let us analyze the large amount of information contained in it from this point.Everyone also saw that part of the reason was the previous action-when President Park picked up the car key under the body of another bottom man, he pinched his nose. This is to avoid smelling the damp odor that he had been staying in the ground for a long time; and this behavior aroused the resentment of his father Keizer. Other than that, I want to say that this is not the only reason. Let us analyze one by one.First of all, President Park 's aversion to the behavior that is temporarily called \"moisture\" seems a bit abnormal at this time: the tutor who was asked by his wife has been stabbed in the heart, and his life is punished. He is saving lives, but at this juncture he still has to avoid the \"bad smell\" of the people at the bottom. This seems a bit abnormal, and some people will think that this is a \"play\". I think this illustrates a point: he is more than unaccustomed, he strongly hates this taste.This action caused Kizawa, who was originally in the camp of President Park, to fall to the camp on the side of the deceased holding the key. Yes, they tried every means to get themselves a job, become a \"parasite\", and gain wealth. They are all private animals, but their encounters are the same. Compared with President Park, he has a class gap.After all, why did President Park strongly hate this damp smell? There is a reason for everything. One of my personal speculations is that President Park was born into an ordinary family, rushed into the upper class by his hard work, and married Mrs. Du who appreciated her talents. This requires a process, and after this process is finally carried out and succeeded, the person who has risen in status will feel aversion to the people in the relatively lower class before him. This aversion is often stronger than the people who are already in the upper class; not to mention him At the time, we were dealing with people from the bottom who were \"lower\" than the civilian class. This layer of disgust is in the bones, so it is so disgusting to smell that smell, which explains the \"abnormal phenomenon\" above. Similarly, the Kize family also experienced a change in status caused by a change in status. Before \"Parasitic\" came to President Park's house, when both parents were in the state of unemployed nomads, they saw that the drunkard outside the window did not dare to provoke peeing at home, or his son's friend, the drunkard roared away. But when they saw the drunkard again after they had a job, they fought hard, feeling that they had a bottom, and felt that their status exceeded that of the drunkard. This also proved that after the promotion of status, they would hate people who stayed in the previous class. Similar stories like Fan Jinzhong received preferential treatment after lifting, too much.Let me say one last thing here. Why do you think President Park is ordinary? The above is just one reason, and many other small details can also prove this point, like being unfamiliar with aristocratic education, and finding tutors for the children are all controlled by Mrs. Du; like when the children are camping on the grass, they are willing to He slept casually on the sofa. Or if you find a foreign object in the car, you can carefully and rationally analyze its origin. This detail is a relatively important quality from the civilian to the upper class. Of course, these are speculations, and there may be other reasons behind these actions. If the personal assumptions are really set by the writers, it can be said that this movie is very intentional and has a lot of details.Returning to the above, in addition to the strong aversion of Kizawa, which led to the scourge of murder, President Park 's behavior also has another layer of relatively comprehension, that is, the whereabouts of the Kizawa family will be exposed. The corpse in front of him was a low-level person before his death, and he could see it on the outside. The smell on his body was similar to the driver, nanny, and two teachers in his home-they could be elegant in appearance, but their heart and some behaviors could not hide their truth Appearance. In addition, Kize was very excited when introducing the babysitter, combined with his own meticulous analysis above, so that he could infer the secret of this \"parasitic family\". Keizer took this into account, so he could only destroy evidence that would prove that they were a family. Similarly, this reasoning also has a small problem. Because her daughter is almost dead, and the hostess sees her husband 's driver suffering from the serious injury of the tutor to this point, it also feels a bit strange. This matter will be exposed sooner or later, so kill Park The president has no way to hide the truth. Killing and not killing, neither of them can stay here for a long time. The grief of losing their daughters can't be restrained. It can only be said that under the circumstances, a blank brain did not allow him to consider so much. The pain and helplessness of Keizer on this frame of the play can be said to be shocking.As mentioned above, there is a gap between strata. This is to say another point. Class differences are insurmountable. Before the homicide, Keizer asked President Park again if he loved his wife deeply, and then President Park took it seriously, shifting the topic and saying, \"Please treat today as an extension of your work.\" There are subtexts. The president is unable to stay with his wife every day due to other reasons for his busy work, so he said how much he loved her, and he felt ashamed when answering this question. Being stabbed by someone lower than himself, he felt humiliated, so he said this. This sentence is actually meant to say: you are not suitable to evaluate me, you are not qualified, and it is your job to do your job. Keizer naturally sensed this meaning, he was angry, he was dissatisfied. He was dissatisfied that he had to be treated as a servant. He was dissatisfied with why he was not equal in life. The dissatisfaction with society eventually vented to the dissatisfaction with people, and this anger burned when President Park pinched his nose. Perhaps, at the end of the film, Kize didn't understand why he had to become a \"parasite\" in order to live a good life, and children like Duosong received a good education from an early age. He lacked effort or luck. Of course, he didn't realize that when President Park \"despised\" him, he also \"despised\" the drunkard.I'm afraid this is the weakness of human nature.Therefore, this whole tragedy is accidental and inevitable. Too many reasons, too many fetters, led him to the extreme. The main theme of \"Parasites\" is much higher than it seemed at first glance. Although the whole story is about the dialogue and style of partial comedy, there are some heavy pictures and deep themes behind which are worth thinking about. It is just three simple families, but it contains so many intrigues, which is really surprising and regrettable. Some of these details may never be discovered by us.\n",

      "Bathing in the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the darkroom will only lead to flesh and blood. Holding the stone of poverty can not be sold for life, and the smell of cheap can never be eliminated. Bedbugs curled up underground, using potions to open windows to sterilize themselves; hosts on high, using money to hire people to sterilize themselves. The rich suck the blood of the poor and rise, the poor live in the rich man's house, the ghosts share food in the same room, and the worms parasitize and develop enmity.\n",
      "I don't think this was one of the best movies of all time. I havent seen many East Asian fims before, Parasite was the first Korean one I've ever seen, so for regionally Im unaquainted with the style.I really enjoyed the movie - it was a great watch thru-and-thru, but I feel like the second half twisted too darkly too quickly, and the pacing in general, besides that, just seemed... Off to me.I definitely think it deserved all of it's awards and it's acclaim. Maybe I need to see it again, like I said I thought this was 'truly great'.\n",
      "Wasn't really horror or creepy more like comedy / drama.\n",
      "I love Korean movies, but this movie is horrible. I wasted my time! Or maybe I can't understand the movie. Anyway I don't recommend it.Boring,\n",
      "Worst movie I have seen all year.\n",
      "I love how everything changes in this film. I won't spoil anything from parasites because everyone has to see it. The way the poor family infiltrates the big but still vulnerable family is fantastic. The spectacle is great and the plot twist in the middle and at the end is just one word to describe WOW\n",
      "A very very well made movie with fantastic acting, storyline and direction. Even just with the subtitles, you understand the movie fully because it is so gripping. It seems natural ! Its funny, dramatic, emotional and what not.\n",
      "This film has different genres which makes the film unique.Overall, if you're wanting a movie of mixed emotions (comedy, horror/thriller, mystery, sad, psychological, etc.), this movie has it.The story of the family mixed with different genres and sub-genres such as comedy,thriller,suspense,horror is done seamlessly and quite brilliantly such that it feels earned. The shift in the quirky fun heist comedy to horrific edge of the seat thriller is the highlight of the film. There is meaning conveyed in almost every scene,every shot constructed with such precision with much deeper layers into it connected throughout the film,for instance, the Native American reference or the line that Mr. Park crosses that urges Mr. Kim to take such a sudden and extreme action.Such films don't come very often and this movie proves why Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today.\n",
      "A fantastic story and casting. Movie is all about getting job to a family who are in need for their bread and butter . But some circumstances changes and they lost their family members. It will be great to see this movie on big screen.\n",
      "I regret not watching this movie sooner. This film made me wonder if it really exists, all because it is such a distinct and unique plot at the same time, told in a splendid way. The mystery is satisfying and the horror is impeccable. He is a perfect example of the bubble that nobles live in in society and the lack of empathy that overlaps both sides. Every cut and every scene was perfectly timed. In a plot with a long duration, I didn't lose my concentration even once. We have here a majestic representation of the conflict between social classes. We don't need to speak in English to represent something that happens all over the world.\n",
      "As far as I can remember, the last time I watched a Korean film was in January last year and it was \"A Taxi Driver\". Most of the movies I watch, apart from those in the big screen, are mostly recommended or are heavily talked about. I heard about this movie, Parasite, a few months ago when it won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival in May, becoming the first Korean film to do so. My expectations were too high, but this film did not disappoint. It is obviously one of this year's best cinematic offerings.It was a good decision not to read anything about the plot of this movie. All I knew before watching was that it is a \" satirical black comedy thriller film\". I expected the \"satirical\" portion to be the reason why this film is universally acclaimed. But my mind couldn't do away with the word \"thriller\" (look at the movie poster, it's already creepy) since I don't normally watch thrillers alone.It was indeed a thriller!I was thrilled to the point that I was so stressed I had to pause the movie a few times to catch my breath. I was stressed but it was the kind of stress one discreetly craves in a movie since the stress gives satisfaction. There are no supernatural beings in this movie. No robots, no science fiction, no ghosts, no zombies. But as for the criterion of being a thriller, it satisfies with flying colors.The shifting of the mood in this film is shocking. It starts like a heist film - something that feels like the Ocean's movies. Then it transitions into something that feels like a documentary about poverty. The first half makes your heart skip a beat while the second half slows it down, without getting repetitive or monotonous. And then you reach the final scene where you begin to think a lot about everything that transpired.Parasite is a film with a beautiful narrative where metaphors, symbolisms and parallelisms all run up and down in a staircase. The social commentaries are evenly laid out from the first scene to the last one. This is a film about class struggle, about the gap between the rich and the poor, about mental illness, and about realities in the world that are difficult to acknowledge.This movie has so many layers it is probably best to watch it with a lot of friends because there are so many things needed to be discussed.What good is a movie when you don't want to talk about it afterwards?\n",
      "I can't begin to explain how horrible this movie is. I painfully watched the whole movie expecting it be good. If I can rate it a negative I would\n",
      "\"If you make a plan, life never works out that way\" A classic line carved in the frame of new concepts and innovative structure of new cinematography. \"Parasite\" belongs to drama? \"Parasite\" belongs to psychological horror? Minute by minute, my mind and thoughts weren't able to keep up with the con family's plan. Through Boon Joon-ho's symbolic symmetrical following shots and a strong narrative all the way till the family dinner at the upper-class house. What lies between those wines is something that the audiences wanted but never expected? There was a shot of the former housekeeper shutting off the light of the basement stairs when it was placed between Kim Ki-jung and Mrs. Park, with a flip of a switch, the mysterious curtain of the house opened. Clearly Boon Joon-ho knows the fine line between a soap opera and a drama. Carrying those anxious and bubbly fragile plans of the con family, I was able to look back and reflect with the father, his emotional status is the needle that penetrates and pinpoint the map of this story. Class between class, what do we expect from wealth and what do we despise from the poor. When we look at these two family, what I noticed is the \"benefit\" that the poor family acquired from the rich gradually shifted into hate later on. By using Mrs. Park's ignorance and her pursuing of reaching a certain hierarchy in her specific social status, and Mr. Park who is the main income source of the family but constant absence of family. Preciousness runs through the upper-class, their vanity of stepping stone to those who truly has exclusive and graceful lifestyles. Surprisingly the story of \"Parasite\" never used something as tangible and as cheap as money to be the bait of desire in the film. Instead it used something as common as daydreaming and curiosity, as we can see, the poor family came to the house with a purpose of fulfilling a purpose of living in quality and wellness. They never planned to harm or manipulate the Parks, all they ever want is sunlight and a clean space with each other. But their plan was jeopardized by another similar family that longs for a stronger purpose - shelter which is conflicted and somehow shifted their impression towards the Parks. To them, the Parks are the emotionless snakes that harvest their effort and their goal of being well in the same society. The scene when two families revealed themselves was tremendous, seeing the Parks reveal what's behind their deceptive looks and words, and seeing the Kims burst with a stronger bond and unity between them is such a horrifying and realistic comparison. Then when we think about it, did Mrs. Park pass out for her husband or for the end of her \"class\". Or we can ask was Kevin's dream of eventually moving into the house realistic or just another anguishing and beguiling plan of his\n",
      "I watched this movie one week ago, was bored after 30 min and shut my pc down. Then my father and friends told me to give it a chance, I was like why not. I am so happy to listen to them, I have never seen a movie going from super boring to super thrilling and shocking. This movie well deserved an oscar. Avoid spoilers.\n",

      "This movie is being raved about everywhere and has won numerous awards and I'm still pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. At first I wasn't sure what to make of it but I soon realized an hour after watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Everything is really solid and I can't think of much that I can point out and say that is wrong with the movie, it's the culmination of a bunch of really great individual pieces coming together to create something bigger - the whole is greater then the sum of its parts. I went in basically blind and I hope any future fans do too but if you're not convinced, tight and unique story, very suspenseful, and charming characters. If any of what I just said sounds interesting, you should go watch this movie. I'm only giving it 8 stars because while I think the movie is great, it doesn't show itself noticeably excel at anything that other movies don't, still very solid and I would highly recommend.\n",

      "This movie reflects the current status of Korean society. The huge gap between rich and poor has brought huge differences in people's mind and material. In fact, these differences have not changed since ancient times. The oppression of \"slave owners and slaves\", \"nobles and civilians\" and \"landlords and peasants\" has never disappeared, but we were born in a good era and we can't feel the cruelty. The most powerful thing is to make you feel that part --- the truth clearly.\n",
      "This is basically a film about income inequality in Korea. Sure, this can pretty much apply to most of the developed countries around the world, but the interesting thing is that many of us don't realise that income inequality also exists in Korea, which is why I suspect the film was set here as opposed to the United States (or even Australia). The film opens in what is known as a half-basement, basically a form of lodging where the poor people of Korea live. Here we have the main characters earning a living folding pizza boxes, and hunting for a wifi connection to leech off (which is one of the reflections of the parasite in the film).The idea of the parasite is an entity that is living off the life force of another, and in this film we have the family slowly move, one by one, into the house of the wealthy Parks (who we don't know why they are wealthy, they just are). However, one of the twists in the film is that we eventually discover that they aren't the only parasites that are living off them. Mind you, it is interesting that the Parks are portrayed as being incredibly naieve, which is the state of mind that is required for the parasites to survive. If we knew that we had parasites living off of us, then we would no doubt act to get them removed, even if they weren't necessarily doing us any harm.In a way, the Kims are con-artists - they need naievity to be able to survive, which is why they end up targeting the Parks. This becomes clear when Mrs Park chooses not to review the certificate, but rather relies entirely upon the recommendation. Mind you, this is the essence of being able to succeed, not so much that you have the knowledge, the skills, or the certificates, but rather that you have the connections. In fact, having worked in the corporate world, where companies do tend to encourage people to recommend friends and family, no doubt because it is much easier to go through the employment process, than to employ strangers (though of course people whom I have spoken to, tend not to like recommending friends, especially since they end up getting burnt).The ending is interesting though, and while it seems that there is no particular reason why Mr Kim ended up stabbing Mr Park, if you dig a little deeper you find out why. Mr Kim's daughter had just been stabbed, but he is not concerned about the life of a girl that seems to be dying, but rather the life of his son who has just fainted, so he orders his driver to let her die as opposed to saving her.Stairs play an important role in the film, as you ascend stairs to get to the Park's residence, but you descend stairs to get to the Kim's residence, and further there is also the bunker hidden under the house, where we discover that it is the dwelling place of a man who happens to be hiding from the loan sharks. Sure, he was successful, but when things when wrong, he had to descend the stairs, which references his descent into poverty. There is also the idea of smell, and that there is a rich person smell, and a poor person smell. Mr Park references Mr Kim as smelling of the subway, which suggests that only poor people use the subway, while the rich people have somebody drive them around.Sure, it probably isn't the greatest film out there, but it does certainly raise the issue of income inequality. The thing is that the Park's aren't necessarily bad people, and this is certainly nothing new - parasites have existed throughout human history, where the poor have relied on the rich for their survival, but then again, the rich also relying upon the poor for their own status and lifestyle.\n",
      "5 Minutes after watcing the movie for 2 hours I felt like rewatching it just in hopes to see the \"plan\" the son has in the ending.\n",
      "Definitely lives up to the hype, so much better than I was expecting\n",
      "Went in with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least. Didn't know much about the movie prior which is the best way to go into this. The film takes you for a ride with moments of comedy, terror, suspense and everything in between. Very well done and solid acting all the way around except for the \"simple\" wife which I didn't care too much about.\n",
      "We have been always fascinated with the Korean movies . But this one is different , it's deep and entertaining full of thrills and surprises. Recommend watching for a night\n",
      "This movie is very nice and thought-provoking, it shocked me and struck me.\n",
      "This movie was sick (you know like good). I felt like I was waiting for everything to come crashing down at any moment, it was insane how much you wanted the family to succeed in their endeavors. They were lovable, even though their actions were meant to be revered you felt like you could relate to them. This movie definitely deserved the praise it received.\n",
      "That ending tho.....\n",
      "I watched this movie (before Oscars) and I know this movie will get awards for sure! And I just came to know that this movie got BEST PICTURE on Academy Awards! WELL DESERVED!Parasite created a history in Academy Awards! A MUST WATCH!\n",
      "I have watched the movie, it does not deserve all these awards and flattery at all. The story is good, and the film in general has a good quality, quite a bit, but it contains many directing errors, like how could the maid's husband tear up his bonds himself? And the father when he came out at the end of the movie, his beard was shaved and he is still very young ... and many other mistakes that make it unworthy of any Oscar. Perhaps it is a political game to say that the Academy is not racist. But even though, it should have not be done this way.\n",
      "I am not in Korean movies or music, so I watched this movie only because it won the Oscar.I was wowed by the concept, gripping narrative, and character development. The way the director showcased the class difference was unique and unlike anything I have seen before (I have watched limited movies, so I could be ignorant).All in all, I am gonna watch it again someday.\n",
      "So many things to say about the movie. It was indeed entertaining, but some aspects were really ill though and just pure stupid. Especially near the end.These are just some of the things I remember :when the daughter's stabbed, the father just sits there watching her loose blood and his wife fighting the murderer, and what does he decide to do next ? Oh hang on I'll go stab the house owner make a run for it leaving my daughter/son who need help. Who in his right mind would do something like.The son surviving a very bad injury to head after loosing so much blood, like what ? Really ? And don't even get me started on the stupid idea of making him come up with a plan to be rich all of a sudden to buy that expensive house.\n",
      "Parasite is a widely successful South Korean movie that won several Academy Awards and is one of my most favorite movies. This movie belongs to the thriller genre and uses metaphor and symbols to portray a deeper meaning.\n",
      "Through showing the contrast between the lifestyle of the rich and the poor, the movie portrayed how different the world is for different people. Although the end of the movie has a very tragic and somewhat gory vibe, the start of the movie was like that of a dark comedy show. In the movie, there was an ambitious poor household, the Kim family, who were with no jobs. There were 4 members in the family and all of them were clever charlatans. As the movie progressed it was seen that all of the members got jobs in a very wealthy family by using tricks. To get the jobs they had to fire the previous workers. Through deceit, they made the house owners, the Park family, fire all their previous workers. At this point, the movie turns a little dark and strange. It was seen that the previous caretaker of the house was also in extreme need of the job and upon learning the deceit of the Kim family, hoped to gain access to the house by blackmailing the Kim family. Both parties fought for the job and ultimately killed the previous caretaker. Then the movie turned even bleaker when Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park due to his lack of empathy for the poor.\n",
      "What makes this movie such a masterpiece is the apt naming. The name parasite refers to the hierarchy of the society and its living conditions. The poor must rely on the rich for their existence in our current world. They must serve the rich. But the poor must fight amongst themselves to get the opportunity to serve the self-absorbed rich. Even then they remain unseen, the society does not share in their joy, nor does it flinch in their misery. In the movie, there was a scene in which the Kim family lost their home due to heavy rainfall. It was a matter of absolute devastation for them. But the rich Park family called the rain a blessing as the weather after the rain was very soothing. This portrays how different reality is for people of different classes. In the movie, there was a scene where a man killed the daughter of Mr. Kim in front of Mr. Park. But all Mr. Park did was ask for the car keys so he can leave the danger zone with his family. Mr. Park did not care that Mr. Kim's daughter died. There were many more scenes in the movie which showed how little the poor means to the rich and how brutally the poor must fight to find the opportunity to serve the rich.\n",

      "Since there are already lengthy reviews here that explained and summed up how original and excellent this movie is, I will focus on the emotions that I felt while watching this unexpected story. The scene that made the most impact for me is the part where the father and children hid under the table while the two owners of the house had an intercourse in the sofa next to them. Beforehand, I had felt a lot of the embarrassment the father was feeling, and it was this scene that I felt it the greatest, aside from the \"killing\" part. We should remember he's a father. He had been setting aside his pride for the longest time, and in that moment his pride was shattered within earshot of his children, and the \"love making\" is making it even worse. The comments about \"crossing the line\", his smell, and other factors a parent would understand, he was absolutely humiliated. And to think that among all the characters of that poor family, it was him that seemed to be a little \"better\" the rest. It felt like a scene that I have been watching for for years, poor parents doing everything and receiving humiliation for their family's sake, and the ones above that doesnt give a damn. To be fair, the rich family didnt seem to be evil, but that's what makes this movie's message so genuine and precise. sometimes, we dont know ourselves that we are doing wrong, because it is already etched in our society. And I loveeee how the characters are really realistic. I love how the director didnt opt for the \"one side is evil and one side is likeable\" play like most do. It just made the meaning very genuine fpr me. And let me just praise the trailer. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and the movie did justice.\n",
      "One of the best scenarios in recent years. Very smart, full of symbolism and links. The first half of the film was perfect for me, as they infiltrated, a funny and rounded story. The quality drops a bit in the second half of the film when the genre and tone change. The very end of the film was also not the end to the end and when it ended I had no sense of delight. I think it is a great satire and a critical society, the division between the layers exists and is quite pronounced today, it is not possible to move from one layer to another, there is a big difference between them. It is said with us: A full does not believe a hungry man.\n",
      "This is just a pure masterpiece. You can see movies like this one only once in couple years. It was intense, interesting plot, amazing actors. Everyone was telling me like first half was OK, but second was boring so film is just Meh. How dare you? If you're basic person who loves only MARVEL or DC films of course this movie is not for you, but if you want to see something more deeper than that pick this one you won't regret. Totally recommended, my favourite movie of 2019.\n",
      "A movie has a capability to move you, into the very inside. A movie is a mirror that shows you the darkest places with brutal honesty, if done right.I'll never forget this film, for the very simple fact that I could see people around me in the characters portrayed. I can see a human life and it's worth, in his own eyes and in the eyes of the world.We are always in a fight to live in a fair society, where we are just and do everything asked from us honestly and hence we'll be safe and pious and everybody will love us, but that's always your story. I won't get surprised anymore, no matter what someone does to me, as this movie shows what humans are capable of in given circumstances.I've seen and admired Mother India, and numerous Indian films dealing with the social divide prevalent in our society, and it always hit me in my heart. I saw this in times when I thought things have changed, but the fact is that they can not. Life is lived in levels, at one level you smoke a cigarette sitting on the broken toilet seat through which sewage is leaking and filling your home, and at another moment you are stabbed right into your heart by someone living in a dark pit for 4 years, while your dad wearing an Indian dress because his boss said so, whom he is about to kill in a few minutes in a house that the driver will go on to own.Every situation in the movie could be just elaborated immensely upon, and this is a movie one must watch to explore the power of cinema and it's reach. It has already went on to set an example, and I'm sure it will be among the greatest films of this century.\n",

After a while it sunk in: This movie is a freaking piece of art. The way it changes half way from an entertaining and comfortable adventure-like plot to a shocking crime scene that enlightens issues related to social layers and class differences, had me consufed at first. But it was deffinately a necessity not to become «just another movie», but one of its kind. This production is unique.\n",
      "This film is what happens massive amounts of government funding is poured into a local film welfare system, since it now seems fashionable to have disdain for the west these days, most people in the west are practicing telescopic art appreciation, and the general public had been dumbed-down to the point that Hollywood can't make a dime with anything other than comic book characters. This film is visually dull and predictable. The characters are uni-dimensional and unrealistic, and the plot is beyond implausible It is Kung Fu Hustle without all the charm and CGI. My disbelief remained un-suspended through the entire cringe-fest. This film is beyond bad. It is insulting.\n",
      "Everything scary is going to happen slowly snd there is no fear for director to show dirty sides of humans.The most important reason that makes the film Parasite admirable at first glance is the way Bong Jung Ho looks at the poor family in the film. Something like the look Koreida had in the movie Shoplifters. Depicting people who, although they live in the basement, although they are poor and do not have proper jobs, but they are by no means lost and hopeless people.The basic question that is ironically expressed in the film is why a family with such intelligence is so poor and their place is underground?\n",

      "I loved the movie and it's concept. I felt the ending was a bit disturbing. I would personally recommend for teens who are 15+. Kids might find this movie a bit disturbing. Loved how the family got themselves a job.\n",
      "Fun and exciting movie\n",
      "Junho Bong is the one of the popular man in korea\n",
      "I totally trust his movie is always fun\n",
      "Amazing Movie. The movie depicts the grim reality in an unusual funny and sad way.\n",
      "I watched the movie knowing how much praised it was, so the expectations were pretty high. I really liked the 1st half of the movie, the one establishing the whole \"deception\" situation . It was very smart and had 100% of my attention drawn to it. I consider the moment when the family sits at the living room and the doorbell rings a chasing point for both the plot and my overall view of the movie. It turned really weird really fast, with some small plot-holes (as of my own perception).\n",
      "I'd give a 9,5 to the 1st half of the movie, to the other half probably a 7. Still, decent movie overall, good acting, interesting idea, nice music and picture...it deserved the oscars it received, no doubt about that.\n",
      "And cinema is indeed a nice way to learn the culture of each country through the stories that are being told every time. I mostly watch European and American movies, so it was very interesting watching a Korean movie, and i did pick up some traces of their culture. Stonks!!!\n",
      "Greed and class discrimination. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect.\n",
      "Heaven and earth are not kind, on the basis of my humble opinion of all things. After millions of years of evolution, a small part of humanity eventually evolved into god and a large part descended into mere survival parasites.\n",
      "Yes, this movie is well-filmed and well-acted. yes, if you have the time and interest, you can speculate about what the movie might mean as an allegory. i'm sure the theory and politics of the movie are admirable. BUT... 90% of the film is simply unpleasant to watch.\n",
      "none of the major characters is likable - much less heroic; no one succeeds or even grows. every character is amoral. one small example out of dozens: a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15-year-old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18. our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student.\n",
      "i read that \"get out\" originally ended with the hero dying, that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie. parasite feels to me a horror movie like \"get out\" without the redemptive ending. or think \"inglorious basterds\" without the redemptive ending.\n",
      "There should be such a journey in the course of everyone's life. It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life. \"Aunt\" is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie. In the tenderness and tenderness, Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle-aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup. Teacher Huang Meiying, who plays her mother, is both acting and funny. Every move makes people shout \"It's too subtle\"! The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan. After she separated from Xu Yiwan, the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes, striding among a group of exotic faces. That was both the liberation and rise of a woman, and the best ending of the whole story. I really like this adaptation of Little Lady. As a kid (actually until growing up) I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together. Because it's too long apart, I can remember very few details, except for two places, one is Laurie's tassels on Jo's apron, and the other is the secret code of their pillows.\n",
      "Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong, giving the director a personal explanation: this is the needs of the times, and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster. And I asked my question in a publisher's tone: I can't see why she wasn't with her childhood sweetheart? I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood. (Well, because of this I'm willing to give this movie five stars, even if it doesn't meet my expectations in a few places.) Once again, I would rather embrace such an open ending. I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period, but I do n't accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person (to his sequel).\n",
      "The genius of the film is non-linear narrative, which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light. Some transitions were very genius, especially the comparison between Beth's first scarlet fever and his last death. Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong, and it really made me cry. It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth's body in the book, which kept me upset. And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb (also Beth said write for me. Amy said Beth is the best of us). Through a story, it deeply tells the social reality, and will make you automatically, think of more social reality, and make you dissatisfied with all the rich and poor. Its ability to arouse empathy and extend the association has been achieved. What you and I come into contact with every day in our society and experience every day. What this movie does not talk about, all broke out through the perception of this movie. This is the real power of this movie.\n",
      "The film finally leads to a very sad ending. In the end, fate returned to zero, and all changes returned to the original point. After getting his father's Morse code, Jiyu vowed to make money and then bought the house in an attempt to make his father see him again. Of course, all this was realized in Jiyu's dream, but can it really be realized? Not to mention whether it can make enough money, even if it is done, can Jiyu's father really see the sun again? Isn't it a real cage waiting for him? Don't forget, he is a murderer.\n",
      "You will find that the real scary part of this story is why Jiyu's father, driver Jin, finally killed President Park. The social phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has made the poor intolerant, but the internal grievances are extremely deep, in this psychological and mental state. The slightest disrespect of the rich will cause a chain reaction of torrents and tsunami. He noticed that the uncle who rushed out of the basement waved his butcher knife towards Kiting, and driver Kim, after his middle-aged uncle fell, had nowhere to vent his anger. He eventually inserted the knife into President Park. However, killing President Park can really eliminate his anger? Can he reverse his fate? I'm afraid the answer doesn't need me to tell, everyone already knows.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the greatest films of the last decade and maybe of all time, but it's sure that it's the greatest international feature film of all time\n",
      "This movieA miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.\n",
      "I'll keep it short.This is one of the two best movies I've seen this year, along with Uncut Gems.\n",
      "A biting comedy, that bites a little too much towards the end. I am not a big fan of that shock conclusion. This great film didn't need shock to make it come alive.The movie reminded me of satirical comedies such as Tootsie and Down and Out in Beverly Hills. Movies that take these interesting characters and puts them in environments that forces them to come to terms with life itself. It also reminded me of Billy Wilder. This is an old-fashioned fairly tale comedy, slapstick and all. Mr. Song is a a terrific actor and I hope that he and Adam Sandler are nominated for an Academy Award.\n",
      "Although the poor family is poor, the family enjoys it! The relationship between the adults of the rich family and the children is very tense. The son is pretending to be stupid. The parents are difficult to control (although they are frightened on their birthday). The daughter is not valued at home. From the scene design of the noodles, the daughter is at home. Status! Bong Joon-ho is a genius, since childhood, he reflects the contradictions of various classes in Korea (including family conflicts)! As long as you look a few more times, you can find more details every time, and the response is very reasonable!\n",
      "Wow, what can I say? It started out as a very clever comedy and gradually gets quite dark. I was very moved at the end. A hard film to describe really.The longest film I've ever watched with subtitles and it kept me engrossed all the way through, you never really know where it's going. Watch it.\n",
      "But whomever shouted the nip flick shoplifters, thank you, both shows a kind of reality that is true, in western perspective we often have this illusion than korea an japan are perfect societes, but reality is, everyone hussle and struggle at some point\n",
      "A very boring movie, waited for so long for the movie to end quickly. I was expecting something more at the start of the movie, but it ends up getting more and more unwanted to watch.\n",
      "Parasite is a gripping and unsettling film that combines elements of black comedy and social commentary to great effect. The film tells the story of a impoverished family of four who scheme their way into becoming employees for a wealthy family, only to discover a dark secret that threatens their lives and livelihoods. With its masterful direction, compelling performances and original screenplay, Parasite is a thought-provoking film that leaves viewers questioning the nature of class and privilege in society. This is a very original work of art that would definitely capture your attention, no matter whether you're a casual movie watcher or an experienced cinephile.\n",
      "I purposely didn't find anything out about this movie and it was worth it.\n",
      "It was one of those films where you don't have a clue what's going to happen or where it's going. It's brilliant and the acting is amazing. I've not see a film like this before. The only film that I could very loosely compare it to is Once upon a time in Hollywood only because you didn't know where that film was heading also (I loved that film too).\n",
      "The Parasite was definitely a worthy winner of its Oscars.\n",

      "Enjoy ...\n",
      "It's unsettling, it's funny, it's tragic, it's exciting, it's horrifying. This is a movie that will definitely grow on you the more you think about it. I like movies that are both entertaining and meaningful and this was definitely one of them. There are no \"villains\" or \"heroes\" in this story, just three different classes, (upper, lower, and lowest) striving to live while feeding on each other.\n",
      "No ones movie can logically explain and tells a story about a social class cases. How the director create a deep message the meaning of \"parasite\" about rich and poor. The \"parasite\" things begin to the movie when the previous housemaid ring the doorbell and then the movie turn from funny and bright to scary and dark. And the disturbing scenes of the movie when the basement guy come out from his place and trying to kills all the parasite family member and everything turning into blood. Then years later the father of kim face his fate to living in that basement and live a lonely life.\n",
      "I don't understand high ratings for this and I don't understand the Oscar award. Grasping vicious characters abound; bloodbath and no redeeming message. I rarely walk out of movies and stayed through this one to the awful end, but I had to force myself to stay in my seat. Hated it.\n",
      "A great movie with mindblowing ending. very recommended!\n",
      "A slightly absurd satirical comedy with a sad ending.\n",
      "The first half is a bit of comedy. The transition of the painting style in the middle scared me. I thought it was frightening (of course not). Next is a series of lying slots ... The plot is cleverly distorted, but the look and feel is not bad. Every emotional point of the audience is well grasped!\n",
      "This movie was not at all what I expected, which is great !\n",
      "I have to say the actress Jeong-eun Lee's performance was freaking awesome !!!!!!! She's the best part in the whole film. I was thoroughly convinced by her performance.\n",
      "Overall, this film is great. I can't comment much on other aspects of the film without spoiling it. The final act is slightly weaker compared to other parts of the film, but still they are all great !\n",
      "It's best you go to see this film without knowing anything about it. That way you can get a much wilder ride out of it.\n",
      "A masterly crafted movie with multiple layers of meaning. Full of enexpected twists and turns, packed with details and visually crafted in a masterly fashion.It's hard to properly write a review without giving out spoilers but this movie truly deserves to be enjoyed unspoiled.\n",
      "What I loved about this movie was the story. A simple and tragic yet original story of some unfortunate families. It tells you the way people are ready to survive with and without having social insecurities. It portrays good and bad sides of all the characters.\n",
      "Considering the rave reviews, I'm stunned how much I disliked this film. Could not wait for it to be over. My wife on the other hand liked it so I kept watching. The garden scene was in my opinion in poor taste as was the scenes back home with flooding rains and sewerage. Mind boggling it won best picture. Must be me though as everyone else loved it.\n",

      "What is most impressive should be two plots. The first was Jin Jiyu, when the family found the basement and knew each other's secrets with the Wenguang couple. As my eyes snuck into the dark basement along the fast follow-up lens, the similar techniques in Flash gradually appeared in my mind, which also made me feel very frightened and surprised. The stairs that continue to turn step by layer. In this portrayal of the lives of the bottom people, I feel strongly how terrible the word poverty is.\n",

      "Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hidingThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come.\n",
      "We people watch movies to entertain ourselves. But this movie, 'Parasite' is very depressing. It has exploited the topic of poverty. The end makes us feel sad.Give it a pass if you don't want to get depressed.\n",
      "The producing and directing was just brilliant. I can't believe how good the cinematography of this to film is. Everyone, every thing, every shot is a brilliant artwork. I watch it and then rewatch it the day after late at night. I absolutely love this movie. It has been over a year since this film won best picture. I still haven't recovered from the excitement I felt when Parasite cleaned house at the Academy Awards. Absolutely breathtaking.\n",
      "The must movie parasite wonderful screenplay and direction.all cenima fun please the movie. The legendary movie by Bong Joon-ho and all actors and actresses welled and the last end scene is very well so please watch the movie the climax is awasome. So pound of bong joon-ho.\n",

      "First of all, my friend recommended me that movie so I saw the movie first I thought the movie will be boring but after sometime I can't get my eyes out becaus it was suspicious and funny movie. The narrator and the actors were excellent and the ending is quit good.\n",
      "Overall I really enjoy the movie😇\n",

      "It was the most mysterious film I've seen in a long time. The story is full of surprises. The person watching will not regret it.\n",
      "This story shows how possible is making a low cost film with great results. It is simple, but the trama is original. Well, not so original but very well directed. This film represents the low-income people of Korea, as any other country has its social problems, and let us know how far people can go when facing hard times.\n",
      "Parasite was directed by Bong Joon-ho and tells the story of a down-on-their-luck family that takes a special interest in a very wealthy family everyone in this family is unemployed and slowly but surely they find a way to all get jobs working for this wealthy family in very private positions a driver a housekeeper a tutor and the whole time this other family has no idea that all these people are related and scamming them. But when something rather unexpected happens it changes both families lives forever. I excited every minute of the film it's extremely funny in essence. It's a social satire because we're watching two very different families and how they perceive things the characters we follow who are sort of scamming these rich people literally live lower than the others they live farther down in the city when there's a rain storm the wealthy people think it's beautiful but for these guys they're thinking that's a bad luck our whole neighborhoods going to flood and where this film shines is that so much of this is told through visuals we get this great sequence where this family is trudging through a flood trying to get back to their home and we just have these incredible images playing out on the screen with beautiful breathtaking cinematography of the city and seeing how people from a certain area are looking at this rainstorm versus people who have to take buckets and get water out of their rooms through the window because their entire house is filling with sewage like in the opening sequence the family notices that their neighborhood is being fumigated for rodents and bugs and stuff and they leave the windows open because if all of this mist gets into their house which the poor family could not refuse. This movie shows two families with very different backgrounds. And it shows that poor families want to be better.\n",
      "Parasite, which combines elements of crime, comedy, suspense and social criticism, is almost perfect in the rhythm of the story. This paper attempts to analyze and interpret some of the problems in the film from different perspectives.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" is a masterpiece of a film that expertly blends social commentary, suspense, and dark humor. The movie follows the poor and cunning Kim family, who scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, only to discover that their new hosts have secrets of their own.Director Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking skills are on full display in \"Parasite,\" with expertly crafted shots and a precise attention to detail that elevates the film to a whole new level. The cast delivers outstanding performances, with Song Kang-ho's portrayal of Kim Ki-taek standing out as a particular highlight.The film's themes of social class and inequality are presented in a unique and thought-provoking way, challenging viewers to question their own biases and privilege. \"Parasite\" is a darkly comedic and thrilling masterpiece that is not to be missed.\n",
      "This movie was so enjoyable from start to finish. Didn't know where is was going and that's what I found captivating.So refreshing\n",
      "This movie hit the spot for me. It was unique and thrilling. It starts off with a poor family essentially infiltrating a rich family doing various jobs for them but it escalates far past a harmless con. Near the middle it gets crazy and I thoroughly enjoyed the end. Very good movie.\n",
      "Parasite is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It is a great thrilling satire and connects you with the characters and storyline. It is the perfect example of how beautiful a film can be and how playful it is with satire. These are one of the films you wish you could watch over and over again, a film unmasking itself each minute. This is what makes Parasite so great.It's ratings satisfy me greatly and it deserved best picture for 2019. I absolutely love this film and I do not stammer with any other South Korean films being placed over it or fought with Parasite unless we are talking about OldBoy. Although, I prefer Parasite, the more entertaining one.\n",
      "Best movie i like how the plot changes true masterpeice\n",
      "Superb plot. Rich and poor divide was and has always been there, but the way this film has exploited the theme to bring out how humans at various levels play out their part is undoubtedly praiseworthy. A must watch.\n",
      "Amazing film. Masterful direction and performances. Best of 2019.\n",
      "It's an awesome movie which shows the standing and needs of a family in society which they might do anything to obtain\n",
      "If you watch this movie you will probably like it or love it. Why? Because you are supposed to love it.It's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie.It is completely implausible, slow moving and has very little story.But you will like it. Everyone already told you to like it.\n",
      "I had a good time watching it. It's minimalist and resourceful, it is a dark comedy about class that isn't overly and when it is it's an absurdist gesture. I think the physical metaphors come across as a little funny in this way, the use of varying vertical juxtaposition as a theme that varies from the \"ghost\" from downstairs and the Park's so oblivious to what's bellow them they fail to notice their cab driver in frame below them. I do think this movie does try to cover a little too much ground and it blurs boundaries in a way that the exposition and ending are not much to take away from as the shenanigans throughout the movie. Watched the film spoiler free, but if I was told several people will die in this movie for example, I would be surprised as how that would be presented. The start of the movie is not ambivalent but is to me just generally unclear besides to describe a poor lazy family with some light comedic aspect. Still a great movie, I see why it's so loved. Funny, absurd, and clever in imagery.\n",
      "From its foreign dialogue to its perfect cinematography, this movie will keep you glued to your screen. I saw this movie not knowing anything at all about it, with no expectations, and yet it has been one of the best films I have seen. This film takes any genre you can think of to its maximum: drama, suspense, horror, action, vengeance, happiness, sadness, and many more. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it is simply just that good. Hands down the best movie of 2019.\n",
      "Parasite has just earned the title of the first foreign film to win best picture and it Very much deserves it, as Parasite is one of the closest things to a flawless masterpiece I've ever seen. From the great cast, the beautiful cinematography, the genius script, every aspect of Parasite is good. This is undoubtably director Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece and some of the best work of any director. It's story will grip you with is realistic characters and masterful twists, and the intelligence with which it highlights issues of today's society will haunt your mind for weeks to come.\n",
      "The acting and story is top notch. I watched 3 times already and I really enjoy it. We need more director and storyteller like this, too many mindless kids calling them directors and make 'films' that insult the viewers.\n",
      "I suggest you to watch it! Not predictable and enthusiastic thriller\n",
      "It may be best to go into Parasite knowing as small as conceivable almost the film whereas settling into your situate. Permit its moderate burning brilliance to crawl up on you, and thou should be liberally compensated.\n",

      "the kind of movie that compels one to sit and admire.........the hype around it.\n",
      "the film maker had faith in the audience's stupidity levels to appreciate whatever garbage he felt like throwing in the movie.\n",
      "I saw this movie back in October 2019, much before its hype and while the first half of the movie is intriguing, it takes a downward spiral after that with its foolish plot.\n",
      "*Spoilers*\n",
      "mix of cliche / indigestible scenarios e.g. infiltrator family becomes uncannily cunning and smart as they take up one job after the other.\n",
      "a man staying in the basement, for years, unnoticed.\n",
      "infiltrator family's overboard feast while the owners are away, and guess what? home owners return right at the moment (who could have predicted that!).\n",
      "the people living in the basement using morse codes via a light bulb for looong messages, but the owners never bothering to fix the light bulb.\n",
      "and then there is the climax scene with killings... purely weird, unbelievable and nonsensical.While overall the movie is ok, esp in the first half, but it definitely doesn't deserve the attention that its getting. This is explained in director's interview where he says he spent 2-3 years on writing the first half..... and the second half and especially the climax, he wrote in 2-3 months as if he was possessed (high IMO).\n",
      "Such an attention is a disgrace to the other good movies out there over all these years that never got nominated/won an oscar. Its a dark joke on other movies.\n",
      "One of the best movies I have seen so far. It is intuitive, funny and keep you watching with fascination. The best is that you can't predict the course of the movie and it continues to surprise throughout. I can highly recommend anyone to watch this movie.\n",
      "Parasite is one of those movies where it gets you excited in the first half, then just tears you apart in the second. It's either a hit or miss for this style of film making, but Parasite did it perfectly. The best part is how it surprises you in such an unexpected way that it makes you depressed. The ending is insane, and when you thought it couldn't get any crazier, it got crazier.At the beginning, the plot was about a poor family who would slowly integrate each other into a rich family's household by use of manipulation. I love the original plot, it was clever and original. It also brought in a lot of dark comedy and excitement. The second half is completely different, it was about the poor family trying to keep their secret from the rich family. The second half brought in the intensity after a pretty relaxing first half. Because of such a drastic change in themes and moods, it feels like a roller coaster full of emotions. Very few movies were able to make me laugh and smile to just sadness and intensity in just 10 minutes. The pacing was also a really big contributor to playing with your emotions. It's very slow in the first half, then it speeds up extremely quickly in the second. All of these techniques were specifically done to play with your emotions, and it's done so well.The acting was great, everyone gave a very solid performance. No one did an Oscar worthy performance, but there was no need for it. Parasite focuses on real life emotions and how people would actually react in such circumstances. Kang-ho Song gave the best performance in my opinion, as he brought so much melancholy to Ki Taek (Mr. Kim). Overall, everyone had a great performance that was realistic and funny.The biggest reason why Parasite won so many Oscars was because of how well shot this movie is. The cinematography is very slow, and since the set is primarily in a lifeless house, everything is very depressing. The directing is also very well done. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in South Korea, if not the best. He truly deserves his awards, as he puts all of his talents into Parasite.I love and hate Parasite, but I don't hate Parasite in a bad way. It really plays with your emotions in a crazy way. Everything in this movie was done to simply toy with your emotions; the pacing and mood changes were so effective. And in a modern cinema where adapting screenplay is more common than not, Parasite will go down in history.\n",
      "A milestone in Korean cinema. Amazing set design and symbolism. Bong is a genius!This films have gotten everything to keep you hooked! For me, this film has all the basic of cinema and Bong have really mastered it.\n",
      "Parasite represents the example of a movie illustrating the social gap between the poor and the rich. With it's absurd language, utilizes a lot of theatrical elements. I recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh and cry at the same time. This movie will make you think about your place in society, but it will not make you sorry for occupying that place. There are a lot of movies about thic topic, but most of them take themselves too seriously, and their goal is to awake guilt in the spectator, thus the true message will be hidden under that feeling. In contrary, Parasite uses the language of humor, irony and absurdity. I think Bertolt Brecht would be proud of this masterpiece.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the plot.\n",
      "Very clever.\n",
      "The ending could have been a bit more in regards to the violence.\n",
      "The most heartbreaking part of the film is when he is narrating the letter to his dad and then you find out it's just a wish.\n",
      "Great twist.\n",
      "After watching few moments, I thought 10 star is not enough for this movie. But when i continue, I found that 1 star is more than enough for this movie. Regret. You may like the movie, but this movie was not for me .\n",
      "The biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on \"excellent\" performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable, with deception, It is deceitful, but on the whole \"performing\" is very immersive for rich families. Until the emergence of another \"parasitic\" family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot, the final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, people felt suffocated.\n",
      "This film seemed very good in the photographic and scenic part, good characters and a decent plot that is losing its strength at the end where in my case, I get out of the experience of those people by putting a complex and very twisted twist with a style Oriental that for my taste does not work at all. Is it the best of the year? I do not think so, but I do think it is an excellent foreign film with a clear criticism about class conflicts but I like it much more as the movie shoplifters puts it, being more realistic and cruel to the point of making you reflect and depress you for its plot. sorry for my English.\n",
      "Honestly I was reluctant to watch this movie for a long time. Because I felt Joker should have cleaned up at the Oscars. But after seeing this I fully understand the academy's decision. What a masterpiece of storytelling. It simply has every ingredient a perfect movie needs. Excitement, laughter and crying it's all in there.\n",
      "I am a an impatient person but I watched all of it.\n",
      "I was like ..wait what kinda movie is this.\n",
      "Then I realized...its a really really good one. Thats what kind it is.Super cool.\n",
      "Refreshing.\n",
      "Haunting.\n",
      "The beauty of this movie is that nothing special about it yet everything is special.the treatment given to story is very fresh and it surprises you when least expected. To get the real feel you have to watch it that how a simple story can be done in intresting way .just one word \"Bravo\".\n",
      "Its nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting and writing is just excellent. There is never a dull moment in the movie. It is one of those movies where you never have to look at the watch to see how much time has passed by. The class struggle is brought out in a humorous way that is dark and disturbing at the same time. The characters seem very real and remain fresh in memory long after the movie is over. A must watch Korean film.\n",
      "Waste of time waste of money, frankly speaking i didnt like it at all\n",
      "\"Feels good movie... Family movie... Masterpiece... Survival... Lifestyle... Life lessons... Morality...rich and poor... humanity... love... peace... Movie lovers must watch this movie.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing movie. And in my opinion could have been perfect.\n",
      "This is maybe one of the best films ever existed. AND ITS KOREAN!!! Amazing. In your face Hollywood.!!! I am a big fun of the director. Kim family vs. Park family. Wow.\n",

      "One that will leave you thinking\n",
      "In todays world a vision and film like Parasite was really an achivement by its film makers. Film was very well placed and was connected and holding interests throughout to watch. The expressions of the characters were really very funny and interesting at the same time. Overall an amazing work and well deserved Oscar.\n",
      "The idea of the film is perfect, action is good, storyline is clean, only what is missing is a little bit more of action in film, by that I mean more intrigue etc.\n",
      "In the center of the plot of \"Parasite\" is a typical dysfunctional Ki-woo family - a husband, wife and two children - living somewhere beyond outright poverty in an old damp basement. They have modern phones, but there is no way to pay for Wi-Fi, so they catch it in a nearby cafe, curled up in three deaths on an old broken toilet.

      "I truly cant believe this movie was placed in the same iconic tier as Pulp Fiction and illustrious famed prize of the Cannes Film Festival.Im looking for reasons to love this movie and cant pin anything that made this film stand out.The Beginning: 8/10\n",
      "The film starts off like any other, everythings going just fine. Then you begin to see how things can possibly get twisted. The director gives those subtle clues when this dark plot may soon reveal itself i.e. the rock, when the english tutor repeats his friend on dating this girl, the art tutor making the son behave out of nowhere and pointing out a mental disability, the ghost and much more.The Middle: 5/10\n",
      "With all these subtle clues that force an audience to question the \"why\" was...brilliant. But to our dismay, none of these \"clues\" actually lead to anything. They were cheap thrills to pass the time. Horrible.The End: 3/10\n",
      "Apparently the end was some kind of twist according the raving reviews. Expect the unexpected. I was left in my seat saying \"hmm ok, wtf?\" Yes, completely unexpected as to the driver killing the father. But because he hated the smell? You're gonna have to dive deeper as a writer or director to actually pull any emotion from an audience as to why he hated the idea of him smelling how he did.Nothing special, nothing worth remembering...a come and go film as it is.\n",
      "In the scene of heavy rain, the director used the method of comparing montage to express the group pictures of the rich and poor families in the heavy rain. Lay the groundwork for the outbreak of contradictions at the end of the following. Isn't it ironic that Mrs. Park stresses that imported toy tents for her son in the United States are more reliable and sturdy than Kim Kezer's home in the heavy rain?\n",
      "Ji Yu family rushed home, found that all of them have been flooded, people in this time of crisis, rescue must be their most cherished things. Father saved his wife's medal in a hurry , and he knew that the honor was important to his wife.\n",

      "Portrait of a society. Of a World with a lot of humans that can be capable of doing whatever they can tu only SURVIVE. The analysis of a parasite in relation with the human is impecable. Details of the director carefully taken, like the Morse code, the kid being a Indian, the terror scenes strongly built up to make you scream from inside converge great in this movie. Comparison of a simple insect that that moves with his tiny arms and legs eating, evolving, wasting resources till it can't no more. Humans are a weir race and with this movie we can FULLY Understand a reality that lives.\n",
      "A masterpiece, easily the best movie of the decade in my opinion. The biggest roller-coaster of emotion with greater suspense than any horror film I can think of. The themes of class struggles are also very well portrayed. 10/10.\n",
      "This movie exceeded my expectations, acting, direction and all other fields class of its own, benchmark set by these cast and crew to inspire global audience.\n",
      "Starts as a comedy but turns philosophical, movie although in korean is easy to understand with subtitles\n",
      "Incredible movie about differences between social classes, but in a very unusual way.\n",
      "Still unsure why this won so many awards, I recently watched again and still did not get it.I can not really review without adding storyline hence (spoiler alert)\n",
      "a family of con- artist and thieves infiltrate a house and hide in the basement the end, that's it, I really do not the understand why so many awards for a film that has no purpose or meaning, I must be confused some how but this film for me just did not make any Impression, I watch alot of 'foreign' films this does not compare to 'Along with the gods1 or 2, old boy, I saw the devil, even norwigen films,\n",
      "I do not know.As a film for me, I would not waste your time.\n",
      "A combination of intense drama and dark comedy. Will definitely keep you entertained trough out the movie.\n",
      "At first glance you think this is going to be terrible. The acting is sooo bad. The rich guy walks with his head high, chest puffed up, almost like an animated character while the poor characters are crawling, bend over like Quasimodos ... It's way to much even for a slapstick comedy. It's sort of like GOT, once you discover that everyone on screen is acting really pourly you accept it, and go along with the story. And what a great story. A few minor plotholes but it doesn't matter. The cinematography and set design makes it all worth the while. Definitely watchable.********\n",
      "Class diffrence could not be explained better. The scenario is thunk in a very good way. The soundtrack of the movie is quite good and music gives you motivation.Everyone maybe did not like the end of the movie but I think end of the movie fits scenario in a good way. The reason why I loved the end of the movie was showing the audience money doesn't bring happiness. So I found meaningfull the end of movie but the reason I cut 1 point is about the Park's pureness because at least people suspect when suddenly your servants changed but Park's family isn't like that they belive whatever Kim's family says so that did not seem realisctic to me. But overall I think it's best movie of 2019.\n",
      "Must watch movie ,m brilliant concept made by the team . Kudos to team . I love these kind of movies like it has full packet of entertainment like it has emotions , drama , suspense , romance and many more things to watch in the movie .\n",
      "I've never watched a movie like this one. It's a masterpiece.\n",
      "At first the movie feeled sad, but then got a very nice touch of dark humor. What i really enjoyed that this movie is one of its own kind. Its pushing the viewers emotions and plays around with a dramatic story.\n",
      "The scenery, the performance, the achitecture, the cast, everything knits tightly together to form a bittersweet -masterpiece if I dare say- film. It's been a while since I saw it, but it stays with you; a must see for sure.\n",
      "Sometimes you just defend a movie or an idea because everybody likes or some loud people will scream the idea. But this movie is not a masterpiece or sth.\n",
      "The family gave them jobs,money and opportunity. They were not treating them bad. They were just rich and they needed people to work with them. Why would you hate, lie, betray a family who gave you job and family and kill the man in the end with no motivation?\n",
      "The guy lives in the basement doesn't have motivation to attack people like that. (Ok let's say he got crazy because they killed his wife but the director doesn't show this! We don't see character getting crazy and losing his mind in one day)\n",
      "The father doesn't have motivation to kill the boss he just helped you and your family and you are disturbed because he doesn't want you to cross the line ? What the hell is that ? You supposed to be friends with your boss or you kill him? He tells you to do your job. His son is having health problems and the father was too worried he lost his mind, he didn't care people bleeding, he was blind couldn't think properly so what ? Everybody has a moment that can't think properly, a shock.\n",
      "The movie is too overrated. So we should kill the rich because they have money and they provide jobs ? Or this is a critic for those who is greedy. In both ways i dont like a character killing another one with no motivation or they couldn't explain well .\n",
      "An intriguing deep dive into class systems that pushes the cinematic needle. Parasite teeters on disturbing and rather brilliant, as the film progresses you begin to straddle the line of empathy for a less fortunate family that succumbed to the greed of man and a well off family's laughable negligence. The cinematography is amazing, the use of angles throughout the course of the film really drives home the class metaphor thats pushed throughout the movie. Some really stellar performances all around, definitely a must watch.\n",
      "The writer/director of \"Parasite\" , Bong Joon Ho takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected Wi-Fi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film \"Snowpiercer.\" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described \"Parasite\" as \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.\" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. \"Parasite\" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.\n",
      "In the year 2019, Parasite a\n",
      "Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of\n",
      "cinema.\n",
      "The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie. I'll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more. The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra-ordinary. The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime. Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time, strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem. Hats off to Bong Joon-Ho & Han Jin-won for creating this masterpiece.\n",
      "The film begins with a story about infantile adults, a traditional family consisting of mom, dad and adult children of different sexes, who sit around the clock in a stuffy basement, penniless, stealing neighbor's Wi-Fi, aki, parasites. And it's not for nothing that the mention begins with mom, she is the clear leader of the family, and although the tenderness is not visible on the screen, but the unspoken unity that unites this family immediately catches the eye, They stand for each other like a mountain.The film has elements of comedy and black humor, detective and thriller, there is something from horror, and something from horror films, but in fact, this is a very important action drama that gives incredible food for the mind and space for imagination.I liked \"Parasites\", I watched them twice. This happens rarely. I recommend it to those who can distract themselves from clip thinking for 2 hours and watch a rather unhurried movie. Unhurried does not mean slow. There are a lot of episodes in it when people show cunning and use manipulation. There are many moments when everyday life is shown, and when the plot turns in an unexpected direction at all. I love all this.\n",
      "This film has opened my eyes to so much more foreign film. I already enjoyed a lot of Russian film and the odd Anime, but this film was really a masterpiece. You won't regret watching it. If on Amazon prime, don't turn subtitles on thinking that's how it works, you have to have them off for the subtitles to appear. It took me a moment to figure that out.\n",
      "Great film - one of the best in the last couple of years\n",
      "I had no idea what this movie was about and I suggest you watch it knowing the same. I loved the twist and turns, the not knowing what was going to happen next. At times, It had me on the edge of my seat, other times it had me laughing out loud. Don't let the subtitles put you off either. I got so sucked into this movie that I forgot they were even there. This movie is so different to most, I feel I haven't watched anything like this before. Ignore the negative reviews. I have read some saying this movie is overrated and terrible, then i noticed the grammar and the spelling and it all made sense. They didn't understand it. This movie is VERY good. Enjoy.\n",
      "9/10\n",
      "One of the worst movies I ever watched , and first time seeing high rated movie and idiots with a scam reviews recommending it ,just a waste of 2 hours\n",
      "Absolute masterpiece. Makes me want to learn Korean just so I don't have to pay as much attention to the captions! This film does a great job holding you in suspense for the entire time. I cannot recommend it enough. It's pacing done well. Multiple stories and details are woven together so beautifully!\n",
      "The film parasites makes you think about some life moments. This story is not typical for Russia and therefore it was interesting to watch. The title really suits the story! Many, of course, unpleasant moments, but tolerable.\n",
      "This is obviously an excellent movie - great acting and directing and production and photography with excellent dialouge and a tight script. It seemed to me that the ending was 'rushed' and it was far too predictable. But this movie has some great moments that will go down as movie moments for a long time - no spoilers.\n",
      "I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such. The lead role is Kim the father, but in many contexts it is also about the son, daughter and mother - the parasites.\n",
      "Cinematography is very good.Excellent acting by all lead actors.Perfect mix of art and commercial, this is how movie should be made. It entertained audience as well as received many major awards.\n",
      "Objective as i could get, this one really had everything right for me. i even watched it at the right time even if it was too late but i think it was worth it. i loved every frame of it and it delivered its message in the best way it could. dark comedy is one of my favorite genres and this further solidified it's position and worth in my opinion. i'm not a movie critic, i enjoy them. everyone in its own. so i really don't have the dictionary or the knowledge to throw big words, all i have is my feelings and they were obvious. thank you bong joon-ho for the experience. it was the best i've had in a long time.\n",
      "Such a resourceful family, stuck in the social ladder! This movie is very different from the usual movies you will watch. It's very troubling. But you've got to watch it.\n",
      "Kim family members are intelligent yet very poor. They somehow persuades rich \"Parks family \"into entering their home as servants, housekeepers etc. Kim family starts to suck blood from \"Parks family\" Because Parks family is so rich they have already been exploiting poor families for years. So they deserve it completely.Kim family tries to be rich at the expense of others, but it is OK. They are poor, they are victims of the system, so they have right to do that. They make other poor people lose their jobs. They don't waste their time and immediately starts drinking alcohol and having a big feast in the \"host\" family's house.Joking aside, why do some people refuse to criticize Kim family's greed. They already got one good job, why not stop? Let the others benefit too. They get other jobs by defaming previous employees.I am not a great fan of \"Parks family\", but am I supposed to hate them. What's wrong with them. They are just rich and extremely gullible. They even help other families by giving jobs, they don't make them work like slaves.By the way, at the end the man from the poor family kills the man from the rich family because the rich guy hates the poor he even thinks they smell bad. (God, can you imagine that? How can a man be that evil?)The film which deserves this year's Oscar is definitely \"Joker\" which truly depicts a man who is systematically and unceasingly ignored and looked down on. It is the real critic of greedy and selfish society.Parasite got Oscar because it is an Asian movie. Joker didn't get Oscar because it is so American. It is even part of DC comics, so that makes it definitely not Oscar-worthy. The academy wanted to show they care about rest of the world and other cultures. (which is good in theory.), but art should be universal regardless of director's gender, race, or culture.\n",
      "The movie was really amazing but the plot twist wasn't the surprising, though.\n",
      "There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking. Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or.\n",
      "This definitely deserved an oscar! It's a masterpiece of photography, acting, and script. I can't say what's the gender of this movie...Start as a comedy and exactly in the middle turns to be a thriller/horror (I'm not joking, it's evenly divided).\n",
      "It's a ''cult movie'' with subtle meanings behind the obvious, when I finished I didn't understand all the things in the movie. But after a moment of reflection and see reviews and comments on Youtube, I realize the depth in history, how the social injustices were represented, and why the title is ''parasite''.\n",
      "There's no villain, there aren't the simplistic division between ''bad'' and ''good'' guys, all the people had at least a little bit of parasitism...\n",
      "There is a big hype about this movie, and for a good reason. Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names, Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses.So, overall, Parasite is good. If you like movies about real people, that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice, than watch this one. It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together. The performances were top notch as well. The story, finally, was well paced and interesting.\n",
      "Fantasy is beautiful, but reality is cold. The desire of the family to become different was quickly punctured by reality. It is not easy to cross the gap between the rich and the poor. Who is the parasite, the poor family who exudes the smell of the basement, or the wealthy family who is glamorous outside and ugly inside?\n",
      "The film won the Oscar for the first time in the history of Korean films. I wondered where it was better than other Korean movies, so I went to see it. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The film is too stereotypical and many plots are stiff. There's a lot better than this movie, and I can' t understand it won the Oscar.\n",
      "Of course, not everyone will share my opinion, but I think most people will like the film. A kind of tragicomedy, it starts cheerfully and provocatively, and the ending is unexpected, with cruel scenes. Starting to watch, I thought that you can watch the whole family))). To be honest, I was amazed by the film, I will watch it again and again, as well as look at the analysis of the film and attempts to interpret it.The theme lying on the surface is the theme of the ongoing stratification of Korean society into the poor and the rich. Someone lives in the coolest mansion with servants (the respectable Pak family), and someone in a stinking basement (the Kim family without a job). But the film is very multi-layered and everyone will find their own topic for reflection and opinion about what the director wanted to say.The main character was lucky - he got a job as a tutor for a girl in the Pak family. Gradually, he comes up with a scam and drags his entire family to work, substituting the servants. So they live and work until one day everything turned upside down, but I won't reveal the secret - see for yourself, but the plot and script are of course the highest class !!!I would like to praise the actors, they played well, I'm not a fan of Korean cinema and dramas, so I don't know a single actor))))). The actor who played the main character also starred in Train to Busan.Separately, I will praise the operator and beautiful Korea: the city and the Pakov mansion, I want to build the same one for myself)), with a huge window and access to the lawn directly from the hall. The contrast of the view from the window is shown in an interesting way, some have a beautiful lawn with trees, others have a lattice in the basement and pissing people))).In short, everyone in this film will have their own opinion, someone will consider the poor to be parasites, someone the rich. And besides this, everyone will have their own thoughts in their heads: about traditions - progress, fathers - children, socialism - capitalism. For me 5 stars.\n",
      "The dichotomy of the families involved, especially how they live, makes the whole story! What a refreshing take on an unusual theme. This seems like something made by a Tarantino fan! I want that house!\n",
      "Parasite is probably the most interesting vol I've seen this year. It was a little hard to follow but it's worth the watch, even with subtitles. Not sure I understood the end.\n",
      "Clever, darkly funny, original & thoughtful movie about a destitute family who see an opportunity to exploit a rich one. Thoroughly recommend it. Little chance of Hollywood producing anything of this quality any more.\n",
      "Not a native English speaker.I knew nothing about this movie before I watched it so imagine my surprise when I realized it had nothing to do with bugs or any kind of infection.Everyone takes different things from a movie. I believe this is a movie about capitalism, and how messed up our world is. They did an amazing job portraying the economic and social gap between the two families.We watch the poor family struggling to survive, trying to do whatever they can to make ends meet.There was someone the other day who told me they were the bad guys since they were \"using\" the kind, rich family, which surprised me very much.The villain in this story is the system, and this story explained it amazingly.\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' hits all the right notes. It's characters, story, twists and turns really drive home an unforgettable experience.10/10⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟\n",
      "Just an amazing film on every level. I've seen it multiple times and discover something new on every viewing. Great to see Hollywood acknowledge world cinema with it's highest honour. Wow.\n",
      "The directing is ameteurish compared to the other nominated directors.\n",
      "The story is interesting but not excessively.\n",
      "The characters are all paper thin and one dimensional. Their motivations and actions are not justified. E.g. the main murder is almost comically undeserved, serving only the useless final plot twist.\n",
      "Americans must not have seen any Korean movies before because this tone is very common. There was nothing exceptional about this film but it probably surprised American audiences with many aspects unfamiliar to them. That is the only reason I can imagine this won the academy award.And best director? Really? No. Definitely not. Any director that can't justify major main character actions with his or her storytelling still needs some work,not an academy award.\n",
      "A remarkable piece of work by Mr. Bong Joon Ho. The narration is so well paced that one is hooked up till the end. The dark humor on class division and how lack money and status can effect a family is very well shown in the film specially in the heavy rain scene. Loved the movies and the performance of every cast is outstanding. It a worth watching movie.\n",
      "I've had my eye on this movie for quite a while, because I have to talk myself into watching movies with subtitles. I'm am extremely grateful that I did. I now understand the multiple reasons this movie garnered it's acclaim. Name a genre and this movie covers it. If you haven't seen it, do it.\n",
      "It's very rare to see such a masterful piece of cinema. Not only is this a uniquely mesmerising story, told through brilliant acting and magical cinematography, it is also dripping with metaphor and symbolism. This is a movie that needs to be watched multiple times to allow the deeper subtleties to emerge. Without a doubt one of the films of the decade.\n",
      "The movie proves to us that the plot plays are great in expressing the social sufferings, and they are told in the form of banter. In the movie, the problem of Korean social class (the same theme as burning, which shows the serious problem of Korean social class) is designed as an ingenious story with strong dramatic tension and full of suspense. The title parasite is a metaphor, and the stone is also a metaphor. A lot of political background corners are used as embellishments, and a lot of lines can be highlighted as golden sentences.\n",
      "So watched the Korean movie Parasite. It is about poor family conning their way up into a wealthy family and things just go wild as the mystery unfolds.The chains of class created by capitalism is felt same by everyone. This is what everyone connected to. The chaos we all thrive for is served well. The whole movie is the buildup for this and he has been able to do it in his own chaotic way! Chaos?!\n",
      "One of his best works. Builds unlike many movies and comes to an end in fantastic fashion. A must watch and hooks you to the point that you don't even realize you are reading subtitles.\n",
      "Parasite is already an International sensation now, the four oscars are icing on the cake.I used to watch dubbed versions too, but from last 3-4 years i am watching movies only in Original language and with subtitles.I will suggest everyone to do the same, avoid dubbed version and watch in original language with subtitles (Intitially it can be tough to read but you will catch up soon).As director Boong Joon Ho famously said \"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\"\n",
      "Talking about the film, Parasite is kind of a revolutionary film.The first half seems like a smart con movie, but 2nd half is a big surprise. It talks about class division, discrimination on poor. It talks about limits the poor can go to live a better life and earn some money. Boong Joon-Ho's direction is flawless, the story is relevant to international level.I liked it very much.Asian movies needs more recognition Internationally\n",
      "I am a fan of Korean movies. Most Korean movies are good. This one is not an exception as to story line and actors. Comparing with the great hits like Along with the God and Train to Busan, this one is less active. What surprised me is that this mediocre get more rating than those great films. Actually, the whole movie is done in a house. I don't know why a lot of people overrate this movie.\n",
      "This movie did not dissapoint. A lot of people think the movie drops the comedy and starts going full thriller at the second half, but this movie still doesn't ditch the comedic tone of the film. I honestly think it does a great job at displsying both genres, both being exciting and funny at the same time. 2nd favourite movie of the year.\n",
      "Movie was do good unbelievable comedy , thriller, all in one package with good message..\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho has made incredible movies in his movie career, but this is without a doubt his best, as well as the best movie released in 2019, and also one of the best movies of the decade. Playing masterfully between different genres, Parasite is surprisingly one of the most universal movie of the century. I know that subtitles can be new to some, but the worth of this movie can´t be tamed by subtitles.\n",
      "Nothing much to say. Absolutely amazing. The implicit examples of division between rich and poor were beyond imaginations.\n",
      "4d ago\n",
      "Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating 9/10\n",
      "One movie I definitely recommend you DO NOT see is \"Parasite.\" For the first hour it is a clever and engaging black comedy, with pointed social satire, but it gradually morphs into an over the top slasher movie. It was like Tarantino and the Cohen brothers took over the set in the second half-- or they may have turned the plot development over to a team of adolescent skin-heads.\n",
      "The fact that \"Parasite\" has received so many accolades is testimony to the state of aesthetic blindness of our culture today.\n",
      "Extremely entertaining, with likeable, easy to understand characters and situations, we follow a poor family who finds themselves in a unique position to take advantage of a richer family. The ending was shocking but all makes sense in the end! There are many hidden symbols and easter eggs too.\n",
      "I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie, or anyone I wouldn't want to show this movie.(Okay but the soundtrack is really good though. Like really good. Like really really really good. Like re\n",
      "I am one of those people who watched this movie only after it won the Oscar. And one thing about giving in to any kind of hype is that it mostly doesn't live up to it. But boy, Parasite blew me away and how.The point the maker is trying to make will definitely hit anyone who watches it. Humor is used beautifully. The climax is mindblowing. This movie comes closest to being absolutely perfect.\n",
      "The human mind's is unpredictable, they has talent but instead uses it to become a parasite. I am quite surprised by the other side of South Korea which is featured in this film, it turns out that economic inequality, is in various parts of the world.\n",
      "It's was such a thought provoking art piece such great social commentary. I loved how the writer essentially made us feel sorry for the perpetrators \"the bad guys\" instead of the victims. It was just fantastic. It turned everything on it's head and the ending was incredible.\n",
      "It's a simple yet effective story to portray the economical and societal level differences between the rich and poor. The movie is too perfect to point out any mistakes, nothing is too stretched and nowhere is left short.\n",
      "How could someone like this movie.by far the most overrated movie to win an oscar.\n",
      "This Korean movie that took all of the Oscars back in 2019 is about a family that gets into a house of a rich family for money and they are doing several jobs. This is a very smart idea without a doubt, but there was a lot of hype because of how much of a thriller it is, which disappointed me because it was not a thriller for me, it was neither terrifying nor playing with Mt mind or something. It had its suspens but it was more of an action/ drama movie. OF COURSE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE GREAT MOVIE. The directing was perfect, one of a kind and I also was very impressed because of the sound design, soundtrack it was very strong, different of course, and it was so right for this film!!!! Good job.\n",
      "It's been 2 days since i watched this movie.\n",
      "But the story, the characters spacially ki jung are in my mind.\n",
      "At last when she died was most sad moment 😭😭.\n",
      "Although more a thriller than a true horror, the movie delivered on several levels notably acting, cinematography and direction.Don't expect too many twists and turns, but this psychological story will certainly mess with your mind in places.A great movie, easily digested thanks to some nicely voiced and believable dubbing.\n",
      "Parasite (2019) is a brilliantly executed cinema experience with an auteur level direction by Bong Joon-ho. With a terrific performance and engaging storytelling, Parasite is a film about common people with their painstaking effort to survive in the current social climate. A wonderfully crafted screenplay with its unnerving twist and turns defies my moviegoing experience. But some choices made in this film personally affected me and saddened my heart.\n",
      "Great film very well put together and very much takes an unexpected turn.\n",
      "The movie seems an ordinary story but tells economic and social differences with a fascinating and stunning narrative. Ending is unforgettable while the whole of the movie keeps the audience in a curiosity. Definitely, everyone must watch this movie at least once and think about it.\n",
      "A+ 10/10 97%\n",
      "What an awesome film. Bong Joon Ho never failes to impressed. Script is great with a lot of themes and metaphors that integrate story. Message about social issues are very well done. Tonal shift in the middle when they find out house keeper's secret is very subtle. Script has a lot of subtleties. Film benefits of multiple viewings. Bong or as academy calls him Pong directs this film really great. Acting is wonderful. Soundtrack is awesome. Editing is well done with fun montages and great pacing. First half is very funny while second is very thrilling and intense. Cinematography is beautiful and green screen is good and production design is slick. Characters are well written. Families are likeable while doing not good things. Contrast is interesting. Ending is shocking and plays a theme of planning and failing. My problems are veeery minor. I didn't like resolution to Parks and didn't like how Ki Jung died and some jokes aren't that funny, but still who cares.\n",
      "Overall:Great film which will be in film schools. Well done, Pong.\n",
      "How? How did it do that? Oh yeah because the oscars have been rigged for years that's how.Bad acting and a bad script with too many plot holes and chunks of total boredom.If you liked it then good for you. If you're pretending to like it just to seem like you \"get it\" then you are only lying to yourself.\n",
      "Here is an interesting fact which I recently realized about this movie; in his work \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\", Karl Marx refers to bourgeoisie and bourgeois controlled state as \"the parasitic body\" which must be removed in order to end the opression on the working class. However, at the same time one can think of the working class family who insinuates into the life of this bourgeois family as parasites. So who is the actual parasite? This is the question I think the director wants us to consider and ultimately it depends on your approach. Director's view on this issue is clear and it is so brilliantly elaborated in the film that I am in awe of his talent. It made me question my own behaviour as an individual within the system. It shook me and I think that is what all great forms of art does.\n",
      "Expertly crafted, brilliantly acted, and inspiringly original, Parasite brings Bong joon-ho, Korean class disparity(which can be a little heavy handed sometimes), and international film to the main stage. Every setup, every edit, is perfectly edited to establish a whirlwind of internal emotion.A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 9/10\n",
      "A lot of people don't think it's fair that parasite won at the 2020 oscars. But you know what, I think they absolutely did. The cinematography is just out of this world. And just when you think you got the plot all winded up your finger the thread spins right off and the movie takes a MASSIVE turn. Like holy the fact that the old maid came back was weird but when her fricking husband was just chilling in the basement.... DAMN. The script is just so gorgeous and detailed. The way were everything is planned out, the way it should be with a good movie. Each line fits perfectly in every scene and everything is so balanced out. From the beginning of the movie i felt like everything had already fallen into place. The actors are so good. Obviously i'd never heard of them but omg... so good. You should really watch those cheesy videos about '10 things you've missed in...' but in this movie it's actually really interesting. Like the part where there is always a slight 'line' in shots between the wealthy and 'poor' people, which makes sense to the line that the rich dad said 'he always seems to cross the line but ends up to just not do it..' It's a small detail but when you pay attention to it it all starts making sense. Or the realisation point in the end where Kim was now hiding in the basement was so mesmerising. The way they played back every move he took to get there. Also when they needed to get rid of the maid, every scene perfectly balanced out with the previous and next one. Everything fitted into everything. Just perfect!\n",
      "Masterpiece .Lust destroy everything.comedy thriller combination.ebery character perfect acting skill. great choice for oscar.👍\n",
      "It's a layered, complex film sans any heavy-handed messaging. Uncomfortable, stressful to watch, in a way. Absolutely deserving of the praise it has received.\n",
      "It really does live up to the hype, truly a great film.\n",
      "This movie will literally make you wonder what you're even watching. A con artist family ruins another families life and the father kills a kind husband and father of two for no reason. Those of you who think this was about \"classes\" or \"crossing the line\" have 0 moral compass and couldn't tell their arse from their elbow. Do not waste your time watching this dirty con family destroy another's like psychopaths or rather ....parasites....\n",
      "It's like taking steps to reach the top! The climax would blow your mind.\n",
      "I don't even know what to say. from the story line, the plot, the actors, the meaning behind the movie is... incredibly artstanding ovation for Bong Joon Ho\n",
      "One of the best movies of the decade and 2019. Surely Oscar-Worthy\n",
      "This was a weird movie but intriguing. It kept my interest and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho is a great guy. Really good directing i cant forget this great movie\n",
      "Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one! Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively.\n",
      "This oscar winning movie of 2019 gives clear pictures of our society ,where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer.\n",
      "This movie is on class war which is shown very cleverly .Even small things are shown with fine details.\n",
      "There is not much action in this movie but whatever it is they seems to be real.The comedy has also been added to this movie and that too in different way.The film has been made horror but we hardly can realize it .it is build so well that we don't know what is going to happen next .Suddenly movie takes 360 turn which is very interesting.\n",
      "overall movie is great , the only problem is that it's in korean language but with english subtitle.\n",
      "This film has interesting scenes & cinematic direction but the suspense fell flat for me. Going into this film I thought it would be amazing because of all the reviews but I couldn't cling to the concepts. This movie is in no way a masterpiece.\n",
      "Best movie I've ever seen. The story is dark but the meanings are deep. The most of the scene was memorable.\n",
      "Combining effective thriller elements with a biting commentary on social disparity, I challenge you to point out an element of this film that feels out of place. Hopefully this is the spark that brings non-English cinema back into the limelight of popular film in the United States, instead of being limited to arthouse exposure exclusively.\n",
      "An unexpected storyline which tells a lot about society in South Korea or capitalism at all? Definitely different from Hollywood movies as we know todays, very artistic with well designed environment. Made me feel tensed like movies 20 years ago, , made me feel bad for the main protagonists. Apart from great storyline, very esthetic movie.\n",
      "Only one film in the world can do that and it's this one.\n",
      "An effective story, a wonderful show, began with comedy, but ended sadly.\n",
      "I was captivated at just where all this was going and how it was going to resolve it's issues and in the end i marvelled at the technical aspects of the storytelling more than i engaged emotionally with the main protagonists and if a drama is to be successful in my eyes you really have to care about the characters. Its not that i didnt care but there were many ideas and subversive elements going on underneath all the drama i felt that it ultimately pulled in too many directions at once to be a masterpiece.\n",
      "The movie has no plot, no action, no development. It's boring and absurd. The whole time I was hoping something to happen and I ended deeply disappointed.\n",
      "It is incredibly well-written, directed, and acted. Bong Joon Ho has crafted this movie masterfully. It is one of those movies that keeps you guessing what will happen next every scene and occasionally throws you a major curveball, but not one that is entirely unexpected. Each character is fleshed out really well and is interesting to watch. Amazing! What a rollercoaster! Definitely recommend.\n",
      "To be honest, I'm a little disappointed. It's really ingenious. It's a very good story. It's linked up and reversed. The performance of the actors is also excellent. But in the end, it fell into the routine of Korean movie. Now I can understand why the director said he can't play through, because if the play through, the visibility of the film will be greatly reduced. Satire, cold humor, and Reflections on social issues are all felt. But I'm sorry, it's not the palms I'm looking forward to.\n",
      "Amazing storyline with truth and depiction of difference between two class of our social stigma.\n",
      "Don't try to define the genre of this excellent movie. It starts as social drama, veers into thriller and gets a finishing zest of horror and nudge of absurdity. No dull moment and truly entertaining.\n",
      "Best korean movie and one of best movie i see in 2019, my favorit movie by bong jo ho\n",
      "Lovely movie.but last part of the movie is just shoking.i felt like.. Wow..awesome\n",
      "A fussy poor Korean family demonstrates that class divisions can never be overcome. A leisurely thriller that keeps you in suspense but never gets sinister, just powerfully develops the characters' stories until the eventual denouement. Parasite is fantastic. It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme here of the gap between rich and poor. But that theme is so cleverly woven into the fabric of the plot that you don't think about it until the fateful scene before the last act. The film fully deserves an Oscar for best picture and direction. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene.\n",
      "Stupid story and unlogic. boring..\n",
      "Very good movie with a simple message. Eat the rich!\n",
      "Nothing much....a pure sign of deep art. An amazing artistic pattern that will leave you speechless..\n",
      "I was very hesitant about watching this movie and it exceeded my expectations more then I thought it would. I understood the premise from hearing others discuss the film. I watched the trailer countless times (You did your job Ads) and I still had refused to watch it, until my boyfriend suggested it (The things we do for love).Needless to say I was very glad to have included this in my list of films I've watched. This movie gave me every emotion you could possibly get. I felt shocked, angered, comical, sorrowful, the list goes on!I would definitely recommend this movie to all movie lovers who want to feel a grasp through their screen.\n",
      "My Lorsh i have been chewing on this film and the directions it could have taken and how different it would have been in American hands--a weak point was when they we're all caught in the house it would have made more sense for them to flee to the basement tunnels but in panic best decisions don't always prevail; moreover, an american writer would have gone all comedy with a happy ending and for me to sit through subtitles i think this film captured me in it's extreme uniqueness and sudden dark turn so after swallowing i think I'll settle on an 8\n",
      "Basking in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing the air in the dark room will only walk like a ghost. Poverty on the stone can not be removed for life, caught the smell of cheap can never be removed. The bedbug that curdles underground, with medicated open a window to sterilize oneself; The host at the top pays someone to sterilize himself. The rich suck the blood of the poor rise, the poor send in the house of the rich survive, people ghost with a room to share food, insect and beast parasitic body development enmity.\n",
      "I like this movie but the ending, everything is mix up for me.\n",
      "i just doesn't like the last one, that's all\n",
      "but i 100% recommended it though ....\n",
      "Definitely one of the best movies you can watch from 2019\n",
      "When Parasite won the Academy Award for Best Picture it made the headlines as the first non-English language film to do so. That doubtless gained it a wider Western audience it might otherwise it had, but then that is precisely what it deserves: Parasite is every bit as good as all its accolades suggest.\n",
      "Directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won, the film's story follows the Kim family, who live in a tiny semi-basement apartment. They are grindingly poor and in an early scene they leave their small window open when the street is fumigated to get free extermination. They seek to change their fortunes when an unexpected opportunity arises and Ki-woo fraudulently gets a job as a tutor with the wealthy Park family. He and his family then deviously orchestrate a series of situations whereby each member of the Kim family gets a job with the Parks, a goal they've achieved about halfway through the film. At which point a bizarre twist completely changes the direction of the plot.\n",
      "It's very funny, with lashings of biting wit in the first half. There's a hilariously cringe-worthy scene if Da-hye asks Ki-woo if he fancies Jessica, secretly his sister, whilst Ki-jung's means of getting the Parks' driver fired so that she can recommend her dad for the job is priceless. It's enormously satisfying watching the family's ingenious schemes unfold; they are horribly devious, getting the driver fired for supposedly having sex in the car and leading Yeon-gyo to believe that Moon-gwang has tuberculosis. In the second half, it becomes increasingly slapstick, as the Kims are forced to hide in the Parks' living room whilst Dong-ik discusses Mr Kim's smell and then starts having sex with his wife on the sofa, and when they return to their semi-basement apartment to discover it has been flooded with sewer water. As it becomes more slapstick, it also becomes increasingly dark and macabre, and the bloody climax at the party, partly filmed in slow motion, is as shocking as it is unexpected.\n",
      "Bong handles the film's transition from one thing to another with remarkable ease, resulting in a superbly well-crafted film. It's brilliantly shot by cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, and the sets are lit in such a way that they never look like sets, whilst Jung Jae-il's elegant and occasionally unsettling soundtrack constantly underpins and emphasises the story's shifting mood. The cast - probably unknown to most Western audiences - is uniformly excellent, especially Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek, park So-dam and Kim Ki-jung, and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi Yeon-gyo.\n",
      "Much has been written about Parasite as a satire on social injustice and Bong has stated that the title refers to both families, the Kims because they infiltrate the house and the Parks because as a rich family they leech off society. But in spite of that, the film defies simple categorization and its message isn't clear cut. Interestingly, the Park family are portrayed as nice people - there's a conversation amongst the Kims where they attribute this to the Parks having money, the implication being that the only reason that the Kims turn to crime is because they are poor. At the same time however, the Kims' self-justification is undermined when they suddenly ponder the fate of the driver they have displaced, whilst Chung-sook's unsympathetic treatment of Moon-gwang and Geun-sae is the catalyst for the subsequent carnage that leaves none of the families unscathed.\n",
      "Ultimately, Bong doesn't provide a clear-cut message about inequality and injustice, but instead presents a cast of flawed characters and leaves the audience to form its own opinions on their actions and the consequences of these. Much of the publicity surrounding Parasite might lead audiences to expect a Korean equivalent of an angry Mike Leigh or Ken Loach kitchen sink drama, but it isn't anything of the sort. It's some more complicated, less easy to define, and highly idiosyncratic and it most assuredly deserves to be seen.\n",
      "A subtle class-based satire is only the starting point.So good that no doubt a witless, celeb-packed, Enlish language Hollywood version is on its way.\n",
      "Simply put it deserved all the praise it got, and the movie is a masterpiece. One of Bong's best movies to date. Will become cult classic in a few years.\n",
      "The concept was very interesting and I liked so much the way they managed to get into the house.Although,I put 9 because the daughter was killed.\n",
      "No words.... wow, what a movie. Loved it. This is my kind of film. I even clapped at the credits. Nothing else to say except its a magnificent watch and a great critique on capitalism and why we need to end it. Loved this so much... *top 10 favorite\n",
      "This movie is too over rated. I think it suite for 5/10. Its boring and had a bad ending for a 2.5 hours Movie.\n",
      "I think it better for you to just watch from the review of other people.\n",
      "Lovely lineup, a great way to present data in a short interval. Title matches with story....\n",
      "I am a big critic if u don't know and i don't give everything I watch a 9 or 10 but this film stole my heart. This film contains everything you want to watch it contains comedy, drama, romance almost everything u can't get bored while watching this movie. It shows the struggle of the family and it shows how smart they are but they just don't have money. We could see how they steal the jobs from others. The plot is quite comman we have seen much movies like this. Is it worth the oscar? Yeah probably but as i told earlier the plot is quite common but the film makers made it as much entertaining as they could. Parasite was deeply rooted in its depiction of Korean society and the movie went very deep in the korean society. Oscar approved!\n",
      "I had no expectations for this film nor did I know anything about it besides that it won the Oscar for best film. I was BLOWN AWAY! Such a cool looking film and very suspenseful/interesting story. Not something I usually gravitate towards watching but I'm glad I did!\n",
      "A brilliant Korean movie with strong characters. Such a big divide between the wealthy and the lower socio economic class. You gotta do what you gotta do to survive! Subtitle movie, so prepare to read the whole thing but it is so very worth it.\n",
      "I seen this movie about a year ago now & i still think about it almost daily.\n",
      "Looks great. Tired plot. If you didn't know what was going to happen you need to probably read some books or watch more movies. Something. Seriously.\n",
      "Drama and exciting movie. The situation Turning situation, comedy\n",
      "Parasite ...the life of a poor family when they get a place where they were wishing and willing to get ..the poor who livetheir lives in the dream that they were dreaming forever..excellent screnplay in every inch of the movie..unexpected climax ..\n",
      "What an awesome movie plot! Really enjoyed this movie\n",
      "The first third of them are very good-looking. I thought they were comic comedies. After the men in the basement came out, I thought six people would live together. I didn't expect that the plot would suddenly change. The director had to lead a story without any sense of reality to the cruelty of realism. As a result, it became more and more painful. The last one was especially stiff. Selina said there was a smell of death in the poor. The film's depiction of the poor is not as accurate and powerful as this sentence.\n",
      "Nothing more needs be said about this movie. If you haven't watched it yet, do so immediately.\n",
      "The best movie and a different and original concept\n",
      "That's it, it's overrated. It's not bad but it's not that good.\n",
      "This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars.\n",
      "Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place.\n",
      "That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them.\n",
      "Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'\n",
      "It has a perfect narrative and good moments of tension. It is one of the best films of recent years. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!\n",
      "Amazing music, amazing plot, fantastic pacing which really makes you pay attention throughout the whole movie. Interesting story with some deepness to it - I live in Denmark and thankfully the distance between the lower and upper class is honestly not that big and the perspective Parasite gave me made me appreciate this even more.I also appreciate the directors continuous comment on global warming like in Snowpiecer - another film I enjoyed, the difference between how the rich and the poor handles rain is brilliant, and the way that enter sequence was filmed really was outstanding. Parasite is definitely my favourite movie of his so far.\n",
      "Saw it in black and white, the score is fantastic, and balanced horrifying topics with hilarious ones. A MASTERPIECE\n",
      "After watching this movie, I liked it very much. At the office, I told my colleagues that this film would definitely win a foreign language film Oscar. But I never expected the best picture Oscar award. This movie was great. The performances, the story were great. The ending a little weak, but overall the movie was excellent. A true allegory.\n",
      "Here is why I think this movie is overrated:The characters are unconvincing. Given that they all have an eye for exploiting other people for money, how did they become so poor in the first place, unless there was some kind of sudden divine inspiration? And is uncouth behavior all the working class would like to achieve once given the opportunity to become rich?Although the movie seems to be compassionate with the poor as a first impression, it does the au contraire from a class perspective. The naive and gullible rich are defrauded by the covetous poor! Shouldn't be like, the rich are covetous so they have become rich?The acting is mediocre if not bad compared to other Korean movies such as Handmaiden or 3-iron.All in all, it is a so-so movie which nobody will lose anything if not watches.\n",
      "No doubt that this is a great film. Great storytelling, wonderful characters and scenes. The build up is slow, but very effective. A lot has been written about this film in all the other reviews so I won't repeat, but one thing that was sticking out for me was the ending. Do we really believe that the father went back into the cellar? Taking the risk he would't be able to get food at all and die? And then, when they moved house, no one lived there, the cupboards and fridge empty for months... How did he survive? And do we believe that he used morse code to contact his son? How does he know that his son would watch? Wouldn't he search a different way to contact him? Call him at night?? And how can the son ever contact his father in the end, saying he should come out and they will meet again? The morse code works one way... So this ending is the only real flaw to this film. It feels constructed and overly romantic. It even spoiled the emotion, whereas I'm pretty certain they thought it was tragical and moving. So, only 8 out of 10 because of the ending. The rest of the film is pretty flawless...\n",
      "Finally something good not like the usual American bsht. Attention to detail... colours ... senses...\n",
      "Even though, it's not originally in English and you'll probably have to watch it with subtitles; Still You are going to love it so much!\n",
      "This is one of the best movies of this year , what i like about it is that from the very beggining until the end you never blink an eye , the events getting more exciting as you watch , and the idea of the movie is brilliant , classism in this movie is perfectly displayed and the idea is different , i really enjoyed it and highly recommand it\n",
      "Directed by Bong Joon Ho, i had high hopes for this movie (As i loved memories of murder and okja). It was a perfect blend of comedy, dark humour, class difference. I don't want to spoil the movie but the plot is good too. I didn't like the first few minutes of the movie because of some cringeworthy acting but as the movie progresses they all reedeem themselves. Some scenes were forced into the movie which didn't contribute in any way to the plot of the movie. The cinematography was flawless. And the ending was bittersweet which according to me is perfect. Overall, it is a must watch movie.\n",
      "After 30 minutes, you should notice this is not a proper comedy, as something bad must happen. Now, a lot of spoilers; please do not read the rest if unwanted.\n",
      "Poor married-and-loving couple with two children get all of them hired by a rich family. To accomplish this, they use false identities, lie and deceit, what involves accusing previous servants (also poor and weaker) of evil deeds and\n",
      "behaviors. Although they all have no job and don't even know how to fold pizza cardboards, they magically excel in their different roles as language teacher, (fake) fine arts/psychologist, high-end car driver, and maid/cook/housekeeper.\n",
      "The rich man owns a successful business, and both he and his not-so-loved wife are basically naive, notwithstanding that they have an issue with poor people's sweat and soap.\n",
      "The situation turns difficult when the previous housekeeper reveals that she has her husband hiding in the basement,what damages the staging of those who are not even shy about using the foster home as if it were a stable.\n",
      "So, the joke is over and now they kidnap, torture and commit murder.\n",
      "When the tortured gets released, a massacre begins. The poor irresolute dad gets finally angry, because the rich dad thinks of his own son first, and kills him. Then he flees and takes refuge in the basement, becoming the only real parasite\n",
      "(he lives on what he can steal, which the previous occupant did not).\n",
      "The circle is closed when his son decides to do what apparently the bourgeoisie commonly do: study, work, get rich and buy the house to free his father. Note: everything would have been better from the start if he or anyone else in the family had taken that path; maybe hitting them with a not so deadly stone would had it done.\n",
      "The idea that this is an allegory about something seems to make no sense. Inequality and injustice implies that someone has no opportunity to improve or it is denied; but it is not what happens here. If we try to look for any subsequent message, we would get some quite implausible ones. For example: a) Poor people are cunning, envious and even murderous by nature (but this is untrue and not the case for the laid-off servants); b) Rich people are bad and mean as don't care about the poor (but they would not be so so naive, worry about their children or give jobs to people who needs them); c) Poor people are allowed to commit unspeakable acts because it is their right to defend themselves from the power of the rich (but there is always someone poorer and richer than you, then you would be able to hurt someone/s while tolerating being hurt by other/s). d) The exploitation of man by man explains some inconceivable acts, but only from the perspective of a decadent bourgeois morality (what would imply that the final solution is the absolute independence of the individual, transforming him/her into a freelancer whatever the society where he or she lives, and nobody - applicable also to film writers or directors - should hire work assistants or home employees, even more as they are probably poorer and will cheat due to some particular exploited's moral rules). Of course, the son would hire no one but enslave his parents.\n",
      "In my opinion this plot is just a sarcastic farce, much closer related -but not comparatively valuable- since Aristophanes to Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, the Marx Brothers, Naked Gun, Monty Python, The Simpsons, Shitt's Creek, and so on. That solves many of the prior questions, as irrelevant. But with a vengeance: many viewers empathize with the mere criminals or their mean strategy, simply because of 'this world's uneveness' and/or they anticipate (or been told) that so is the right thing to do. Some others, like me, will just retain some worthy scenes and dialogues, and forget the rest as a failed attempt. And hopefully, future reviewers may enlighten us with much better insights. The Oscar, not the story, made it indispensable, at least to alert the jurors to be more mindful. Without such a prize, my rating would be one notch above.\n",
      "Superbly acted, brilliantly written and gorgeous to look at. Not faultless and a couple of cracks/gripes in the last act but overall a beautifully constructed film.\n",
      "Nice to be kept thinking long afterwards and looking forward to seeing again.\n",
      "A truly well deserved oscar winner🏆🎉🏆. This has to be one of the best movie I have ever seen. The movie keeps you engaged and thrilled till the end. The director has extraordinary capabilities to have presented an ordinary plot into an overwhelming rollercoaster ride. A must watch for all the thriller folks out there.\n",
      "I first thought not to watch it but as soon as the story goes on we get mix with the characters . They are unbelievable , amazing , authentic , fantastic and funny .\n",
      "Its a good movie with every twist and turns. Scriptwriter has given its best shot with this movie.\n",
      "The poor is \"clever\". The rich is dumb. There's no depth in almost any of the characters. Every one in this movie has a paper thin character that only serves a very superficial role. Not to mention all the plot holes that can't last 3 seconds of thinking.Setup is nice, but the poor mooched half way through but the progression stopped by the intrusion of the 2nd parasite. Right after the serious of incident all the tention they built up got washed away, instead of let it escolate to a meaningful conflict it resolved in a chaotic farce.It's a nice topic and the setup has it's pretentials. But they end up with shooting the pellet with less than half berral of powder.It's a ok movie, but way far off from winning an award.\n",
      "Feeling sad because i can't rate it 20...! Just awesome... !\n",
      "Great movie, and for those that think this isn't a masterpiece, well, they don't know movies or maybe it's the subtitles. I think it was a brilliant movie that leaves you thinking about it for hours afterwords. Get past the subtitles and fall into a new world...\n",
      "The 6 oscar winning movie PARASITE by Bong Joon Ho is an amazing film and this movie like the rest of Bong joon ho's movie usually are talking about social class likem, snowpiercer and Okja, but this movie PARASITE is definitely his best movie EVER, but not to waste time let's get right into the review.The movie starts with the Kim family trying to get wifi using the local coffee shops wifi they live in the very lower class and they are living in the ground most literally, they find an ad for small time job like folding pizza boxes, the fumigation team start to spray chemicals into the streets, the mother(Chong sook) suggest to close the windows but the father(Kim Ki Taek) obliges saying that it'll kill the bugs in the house so they continue to fold pizza boxes while coughing cause of the smoke, the pizza delivery woman criticizes the family saying the folded the pizza boxes wrong and how they can't sue it so they will dock their wages but the son( Ki woo) haggles with the delivery woman saying that they will take the dock wages and if he can get a part time job.Right off the bat you can tell that the family is poor and lazy, they fold the pizza boxes to the point where the pizza delivery woman says it's unusable, they have to scrounge for money, food, and jobs and you can tell they aren't in the best situation.The Kim family starts to eat dinner but there is a guy peeing right next to the window, then Ki woos friend Min tells him to scurry off,Min comes to drop of a gift a Scholar's rock Min is a guy who has life pretty sorted out, he is a tutor and is in a good college, he tells Ki woo that he has to go to a university so he recommended him to the family he tutors so he can get a job, Ki woo's sister (Ki-Jung) forges him a diploma from oxford so he can show the family that he is from a good school, Ki woo walks up a driveway to the house which is big and modern and beautiful, the maid( Moon gwang) wakes up the Mother(Yeon Kyo) she reads his transcript and watches him tutor her daughter(Da hye) to see if he is worthy of tutoring her daughter, after the lesson he gets paid the he tells Yeon Kyo that he has an recommendation for her son(Da Song) he says that the person who can really fell art is a girl called \"Jessica\"(Ki Jung) the mother says that would be perfect to get a tutor for her, so the next day Ki woo leds \"Jessica\" to the house to tutor Yeon Kyo son.The story right now is just a string of lies, Ki woo lying about his scholarship, Ki jung lying about being a tutor, the lies are about to get far worse from here,also the Scholars rock which is a symbol of good luck doesn't bring much luck to the family later on in the story.\"Jessica\" lies to the Yeon Kyo that her Da song has schizophrenia, \"Jessica\" says she would be happy to take Da song as a student, as Yeon Kyu is driven home by the Chauffeur she slides her undergarments into the car seat back pocket to get the driver fired so she can let Kim ki taek take his place as the new Chauffeur, the plan works and the Chauffeur gets fired \"Jessica\" recommends to Yeon Kyo, Kim ki taek as the new Chauffeur Yeon kyo likes the idea so Kim ki taek drives the father(Park dong ik) home, while driving he tells Park dong ik lies saying that he has been driving for 30 years and starts to goad the father by complimenting him saying that he is impressive cause he is the head of a company and what not, Park dong ik likes Kim ki taek so he hires him as the new Chauffeur, Ki jung, Kim ki taek and Ki woo try to get rid of the maid Moon gwang, they figure out that she is severely allergic to peaches so they sneak some peach skin on her making her have an allergic reaction, Kim ki taek tells Yeon kyo that while he was in the hospital he saw Moon gwang and he heard her say she has Tuberculosis, Yeon Kyo gets afraid that it might spread to her family, so she fires her opening a spot for the Chong sook to take the job as the new maid.Like I said before the story brings them to a longer string of lies Kim ki taek tells a lie by saying that Moon gwang has TB and now they hire the mother, the Kim family is metaphorically and literally infecting the family getting in like a PARASITEChong sook soon becomes the new maid and soon the whole Kim family is part of their family, but the son Da song is suspicious of the Kims cause they smell the same, Yeon Kyo is going on a camping trip with her family so she instructs that Chong sook to keep the house safe, when Yeon kyo and her family leave Chong sook lets her family in the house to stay for a few days in \"wealth\", while the Kim family eat, talk, have fun in the house the doorbell rings and Moon gwang shows up saying that she forgot something in the basement, Chong sook reluctantly opens the door to let her in so the Kim family hides, Moon gwang gets to the basement and opens a secret door behind a bookshelf and underneath the house is Moon gwangs husband (Geun se), Moon gwang begs Chong sook to feed her husband as the new maid and she said that she would even pay her until the Kim fall down the stars while snooping around, Moon gwang records this while she plans to blackmail the Kims and get them fired.Moon gwang and Geun se were the original PARASITES taking advantage of being the maid and the past knowledge of the basement, eating their food and fornicating in the basement it's just a circle Geun se had a bakery that went bust so he fled to the basement same like Kim ki taek he had a bakery that went bust so he was in debt and now is poor like Geun se.The kim family while Moon gwang is busy tackle her with peaches and restrains her husband Yeon kyo calls to say that they will be back early with her family from the camping trip cause it was raining hard, the Kims rush to hide and clean the house, they tie up Geun se and Moon gwang, Moon gwang runs up the stairs trying to warn Yeon kyo but Chong sook knocks her down the stairs giving her a bad head injury, Kim ki taek Brings Moon gwang down stairs with Geun se, Geun se has been isolated for 4 years in the basement so he has gone a little crazy pressing morse code to tell Park dong ik that he has respect for him even though da song is the only one that knows morse code, while the Kim family hide under the table Park dong ik and Yeon kyo discuss how it smells like kim ki taek, they go on to say that he has a smell that you only smell in the subway and that insults Kim ki taek hiding under the table, after they fall asleep the Kim family decide to run home in the pouring rain while they descend the stairs back to poverty finding their house is flooded they rush in and try to clean it up.I LOVE the symbol where the Kim family runs down the stairs, the camera shoots the side angel of them descending the stairs from being in the lavish modern house going down to poverty with the stairs literally leading down stairs which is SUCH a good shot It's unbelievable!.The Kim family find shelter in the homeless shelter after their house gets flooded with sewer water, the Kim family try to get all the things they can before the house is fully engulfed with water Ki woo grabs the Scholars rock, next shot shows the basement where Moon gwang with a bad head injury almost breaks lose her husband Geun se, but she dies saying how Chung sook kicked her down the stairs, while going to sleep in the homeless shelter Kim ki taek tells Ki woo that he has no plans and that they should just go to sleep, the next day Yeon kyo sees its bright and pretty outside after the rain and she is getting ready for da songs birthday party.I want to explain another shot that compares the rich to the poor, Yeon kyo says how bright and pretty it is after it rained, that is her perspective cause she lives on higher land and she is in upper class, while the Kim family's house flooded, they lost almost everything and how its sad and gritty, Yeon kyo chooses any clothes she wants from her closet and they look very expensive, while the Kim family has to run and get clothes cause the people in the shelter also need clothes so it's like a Battle royale where the Kims are, this shot shows the difference between the poor and the rich it's SO BEAUTIFUL even though the scene is sad it's just GORGEOUS this symbolize.Da song and Yeon kyos friends come over to the house Ki woo walks to the basement to check on Moon gwang and Geun se, he drops the scholar rock, he goes to pick it up but sees a body, not knowing Moon gwang is geun se chokes Ki woo with a rope, Ki woo gets loose but trips on the way out then Geun se bashes Ki woo head with the scholars rock, Geun se walks outside with a knife trying to lure in Chung sook he stabs and kills Ki jung, while she bleeds out da song falls down seizing park dong ik demands the keys from kim ki taek, kim ki taek throws the keys but its falls under geun se and chung sook fighting, chung sook kills geun se with a skewer, park dong ik flips over geun se and pinches his nose cause the bad smell and grabs the keys, this triggers kim ki taek so he goes over there and kills park dong ik, chung sook holds ki jung as she dies, Ki woo recovers from brain surgery but he can't stop laughing now, Ki woo and Chung sook get taken to court and gets off with probation, they visit ki jung pot where she got cremated but Ki woo can't stop laughing, kim ki taek is nowhere to be found, or is he?, kim ki taek is in the same predicament now he is the one in the basement trying to flee from people with higher power and is trapped in the basement ,Ki woo dreams of being rich and successful and buying the house and letting the kim ki taek out but that's just a fantasy something that he can't achieve.This movie was INCREDIBLE, PHENOMENAL, FANTASTIC its a solid 10/10 for me the camera shots were AMAZING, and the ways Bong joon hoe separates the rich from the poor is perfect I love this movie and I can see why it got 6 oscars.\n",
      "When I hear the words \"A Korean film about class conflict\" I think it's gonna be something stupidly pretentious and needlessly experimental. But no, this film is a masterclass in direction, acting, suspense, camerawork, beautiful scenery, and even comedy. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film. I did feel the peach thing was a bit stupid and it's dumb that it was a huge plot-point. Bravo Bong Joon Ho. 9.4/10\n",
      "Parasite is a film that sends a deep message about people, especially the class system of Korea and maybe the world. The story follows two families that are in great disparity, The rich but Naive Park Family and the Poor but Cunning Kim Family.Kim Ki-woo (Kevin) the son from the Kim Family is the main protagonist in light of the fact that the plot focuses on him finding work for his unemployed Family. quite arguably my favorite character because of how his arc ends, from an unambitious blameless teenager to a determined,decided deceiver with a fleeting glimpse of wealth. His character is lesson in how innocent people must commit repulsive actions in order to protect their loved ones (from what I interpret at least)The Story is written tightly since each setup has a payoff. This is because Director Bong Joon-Ho has written a screenplay that is heavy on Dialogue and the importance of Character Interaction. He further Succeeds by filming scenes with immense detail. The Cinematography is lush yet intentionally metaphorical, for instance when Kevin's Father Drives Mr Park for the first time there is a brighter atmosphere but as his relationship with Mr Park deepens it is intentionally much darker. Close ups are key in presenting the provocative nature of each character especially during the end.Overall I will say this, I have always been a fan of Bong Joon Ho ever since Snowpiercer (2013) became a part of my all time favorite films and Parasite just extends his talented abilities to write and direct entertaining and thought provoking films.Korean Cinema has successfully entered western Cinema and I pray that more foreign films embellish the art that is Cinema.\n",
      "Everything is almost perfect from start to finish. It goes from comedy to drama to thriller so seamlessly that you never recognize the transition taking place. The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because I never give anything a \"perfect\" rating. But this is pretty damn close.If this doesn't get nominated AND win Best Foreign Film at the 2020 Oscars then it will be a robbery.\n",
      "Interesting movie and perhaps better if you are Korean speaking. However, can't believe this movie was an Academy award winner?! I can think of at least ten other 2019 movies that were way way better. You may want to suffer your way through this movie just to see how irrelevant and misleading an Academy award winning movie has become to the general movie goer.\n",
      "Un ejemplo de las desigualdades sociables, La sicoología del dinero y los dramas que conllevan . Una foto profunda a la sociedad actual\n",
      "Having just rewatch the movie again last night, I'm again confirmed with why this title was my personal best movie of 2019. Even on second viewing, there isn't a single boring minute. The tale captures you from the very beginning and makes you feel heavily invested in the story right away.The first hour is gleefully entertaining, showing the poor family put on a scam scheme. When you see it unfolds, it just leaves you with a smile on your face and laughing along with their execution. And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie. Not getting into spoilers, but this build up is well worth it.Overall the movie is simply a viewing pleasure. Great acting, excellent story and cinematography filled with symbolism. An irreverent tale of class differences I would highly recommend anyone to give it a watch.\n",
      "This movie left me with a very sad feeling :( Ut was heartbreaking to watch the poverty these people are exposed to. Weird, but amazing and sad movie. I cant give much more details then this. Just see the movie for yourselves.\n",
      "I just watched \"Parasite\" last night on a Netflix DVD, and I can now see why it won so many film industry awards! Wow -- it was wickedly funny and darkly disturbing at the same time. A unique plot with top-notch acting & directing. I highly recommend it!!\n",
      "In the beginning the movie feels like a comedy movie. But more and more when the Kim family settles down at the house of the Park's, the tension in the movie starts getting higher. The movie works with many stylistic devices and metaphors. Especially the camera work by Hong Kyung-pyo is brilliant. Through the whole movie we see the big difference between rich and poor. The point of the social criticism is very important especially for the Sout-Korean culture. As an person in europe out of the upper class it's very interesting to sees these class differences from other countries. The tension in the movies gets higher and higher and in the end all the lies hit on top of each other. Everything escalates and it's an unexspected ending. The movie is very famous and was a big hit. I guess everyone knows about all the oscars the movie achieved. But it's not the first good Bong Joon-Ho movie. In his early career he had many successful movies especially in South-Korea.\n",
      "Not much to say about this dark heist/comedy movie besides that is awesome and works in so many levels. The places, sets and photography, all works to transmit the same cohesive message that the plot tries to convey. It does all this without being preachy or heavy handed. The performances are top notch and with enough nuances to make them credible. If I try hard to look for errors, maybe there are some characters' actions during the climax that feel that they needed more build up to occur in the way that they did.\n",
      "I was pleasantly impressed by this movie, I recommend watching it in cinema if you have the chance\n",
      "While lamenting that the film reflects the cruel social situation we are in, let's also think about how to solve the social problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor. Perhaps when the production of this exploitative capitalist system changes and disappears, it will usher in a fairer society!\n",
      "Tuesday afternoon. Summer is coming to a close. I hear that the local independent cinema is showing the new film 'Parasite' that has been getting tons of hype. Whats all the fuss about? Well let me tell you.Cinema was packed. Opening Credits, then the movie begins until the final credits at which point the movie had ended.Final reflections: This movie does not fit into a genre. It feels totally fresh and has comedic moments which landed with the audience in the room whilst exploring much darker themes and moments. The cinematography is beautiful and innovative and is a great palette and paintbrush for the social commentary that exists in the movie. The casting is brilliant and the dynamics that exist between the characters is entirely believable.\n",
      "This movie is amazing and deserves the Oscar for best foreign language film.The director is great,looking forward to seeing more Asian movies.\n",
      "One of the best movies I watched, nice story, nice acting, totally unexpected ending. I'd watch this movie couple of times and ill be fine with it.\n",
      "I am really impressed with the way Mr.Bong has portrayed the characters' characteristics. He showed how much time and effort he had put into the process of making this film.\n",
      "However, there is one thing that I cannot stand to not wonder. How come a notable family like that cannot afford a single decent camera inside the house? Is it that easy to break into that such private and top-notch accommodation?\n",
      "Besides that I have no comments on either the storyline, the BGM (which are flawless), the light, the settings, the acting. Everything is great.\n",
      "This film possesses a little bit of everything. Beautiful cinematography, intensely thrilling, poignant and funny, this is Bong Joon-Ho at his scintillating best. It's the type of film that film students will analyse for years to come, and the type of film that would make even a complete newcomer to cinema want to go out and make a film.The best film of 2019, and easily one of the best films of the decade. An unparrelled thing of beauty.\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this movie after I started watching it - it seemed like a brilliant drama-comedy highlighting the problems with class differences. But about 2/3 through the movie, I started asking myself... Is that it?\n",
      "I've watched several videos and read reviews explaining the ending, but it still seems like really bad writing to me. I feel like extreme violence is used as a poorly applied trope in this movie to highlight the point but it just doesn't work. It doesn't fit the story. It seems like a desperate attempt to add a shocking ending and ends up seeming like a pretentious interpretation.\n",
      "Far from perfect and most certainly flawed in certain aspects of itself, Parasite still never seems to be held back. It's funny, emotional, and suspenseful, all while remaining swift with delightful characters, good storytelling, and good acting.\n",
      "Went into this thinking there's no way it could live up to the hype after it's Oscar and BAFTA wins. Couldn't have been more wrong.An incredible piece of storytelling. Script is great, performances awesome and visually stunning. Even if you're not a fan of foreign language films and reading subtitles you need to give this a try. Very deserving of all the big award wins.\n",
      "This movie is both hilarious and thought-provoking. The premise gives the movie a lot of opportunity for humor as well as a tool to talk about class warfare.\n",
      "Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations.\n",
      "Loved every second of this movie.It starts off as a comedy/drama of a family trying to survive by whatever means possible.Then when the son lands a job through a friends recommendation, it adds romance and delves into the world of the rich family which contrasts the lifestyle and ideals of the poor.In that segment it plays with social ideas and it shows you how \"clean and mighty\" the rich are but later throughout conversations they have their true colors begin to shown.Out of nowhere it throws you into a survival situation where the old house maiden comes back but i don't want to spoil this part.And last it throws a bit of action at your face.All of this genre hopping but one thing was always present.\n",
      "The parody.I felt anxious a lot throughout the film and i loved how the Title of the film had an allegorical meaning and it was changing depending on the situation/part of the film you are on.The last minutes of the film, how it was written, narrated and being setup are the most importand part of the film.\n",
      "Without that scene this movie could have been a completely different thing.\n",
      "The tone of the whole film is bleak, with many small details hinting at poor families and rich families.\n",
      "Social satire retread that brought nothing new to the topic. It seems to have brought the topic back to the basics and to the beginning again, and that leaves me feeling as if we haven't learned anything. Maybe that is the ultimate point: class warfare is neverending. Heavy handed storytelling with moments of what I'm assuming are to be \"nuggets of wisdom\" giving insight to motivations in the class struggle. This has been done better and done with more thoughtfulness.\n",
      "The skill of screenwriter and director has reached this level! I really don't know whether I should feel hope or despair after watching the movie, just like this black drama of sadness and joy.\n",
      "I am bored from standard and cliché movies. This movie is very different and original. It is entertaining throughout, has a few twists and the story is great. The movie makes you think throughout and at the end. It is funny at times but serious watch. Well worth all the oscars.\n",
      "It is great. The comedy element is working across the movie, there are many unexpected resolutions of situations but in the end I find it containing too many unresolved moments / elements which might have some additional interesting spins.It's like the movie teases something really really complex and then resolves everything all of a sudden. It's good, but it could be even better.\n",
      "This movie left me thinking and analysing it for hours after I left cinema. I had long discussions about days after I've watched.\n",
      "It's fresh approach to making movies. With great emotional punchline.I'm happy I've seen it.\n",
      "I got way much more then I actually expected.\n",
      "I was confused, impressed, entertained at the same time.\n",
      "I loved the way movie described the huge distance between rich and poor,as they were 2 different species. It is really rare you come across to a movie which is way more unrealistic and yet again able to describe the reality as it is.\n",
      "Rarely this kind of movies are made.. From the moment it starts to the finish, you won't move an inch... Direction, storyline, acting everything is mind blowing\n",
      "Yes, the script is equal to the task, there are several twists (but also predictable moments), performances are pleasant (Song Kang-ho as Kim and Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi), but apparently my expectations were too high after lots of awards and accolades. The title is ambiguous, and the course of events is as the Coen brothers would join forces with Tarantino...The film in question won 4 Academy Awards and it is nice, but if I look back on The King´s Speech, Rain Man, or No Country for Old Men - also with 4 Oscars, then I have to admit I liked those more. My bad... :)\n",
      "With every genre this movie steps it's foot in, it knocks the performance out of the park. Whether it be comedy, horror, thriller, you name it, this film delivers. Films of this nature can oftentimes be predictable, leaving the resulting action to feel, dull. This film will have you on the edge of your seat for more than half of its duration, and leave you shocked at the end.\n",
      "Wow, what a surprise - was not really sure about that kind of Story, but after a lot of good reviews I have to seen it.\n",
      "Great movie, very good actors!\n",
      "A kind of movie, in my opinion, didn't existing before!\n",
      "I just finished watching Parasite. Ir was phenomenal. It's story had me hooked from the start (hype from others helped in keeping me tied in the first 30 minutes too haha). But nonetheless, my heart was beating at certain points and my eyes were burning from staring at the screen so intensely (I wasn't wearing my red blocking glasses). I love the way it started without much detail and ended in the same place it began. I LOVE full circle movies.The movies theme lit a fire under me. It was bouncing many places with my emotions, but it ultimately made me appreciate growing up with little in certain facets of my life. By no means, did I live like this fictional family did. But I can relate.The director did a PROFOUND job on it. Seriously. What a thrilling movie.\n",
      "Parasite is an incredible and amazing film. I didnt expect nothing about it, but its incredible. One of the best films in the last decade. It deserves all the Oscars.\n",
      "The idea that the Kim family are underdogs simply because they're poor is what makes this movie unenjoyable. I like dark comedies as much as the next guy, and I like watching well-deserving people get their just desserts. But every single character in this film, minus the Park kids, are just so awful - to each other, to others, to themselves - that I never felt any sympathy to the Kims and instead just sighed my way through the movie thinking, \"oh my god, of course this is where this is going because what else could possibly happen.\"\n",
      "Movie did not have a bad storyline which kept me interested and also the way the scenes look felt like I was watching from there. The drama really begins at the end but it was worth watching it.\n",
      "I feel like this film deserves all the praise it gets.It is nearly impossible to say what genre this one belongs in; there are just so many contradicting emotions. As with perhaps any film, try to watch this with as little knowledge as possible - and prepare for a rollercoaster.\n",
      "A film for our time. It stays with you for a long time after.\n",
      "It is a work of beauty and says so much about the world we live in today.\n",
      "This movie is a concept that humans have in real too - Greediness. If you being greedy, you will loose things permanently. This movie shows this very perfectly.\n",
      "Movie starts from a very basic level and turns out very connecting.\n",
      "Lies,Lies and more lies creates very big mess that in the end one has to die. and for that one many has to die.\n",
      "Action,romance,drama and suspense bhara hua h sb movie me.\n",
      "worth watching.\n",
      "This movie is good :v I'm just trying to fill the profile checklist lol\n",
      "I am out of words. THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL! What a masterpiece. This made me laugh and shock with the series of happenings.\n",
      "Smart, inciteful, and entertaining...subtly inspirational WOW.\n",
      "At first it was nice to watch, it was funny and harmless, but after a while, they started using violence and it wasn't nice anymore. I didn't like it anymore, I started to watch it because I wanted a fun movie night but it ended in a disaster. I don't recommend this movie if you want a funny movie.\n",
      "The Screenplay of the movie is really good. The movie starts from a Comedy Genre and ends up in a Sad and Thriller. I would really appreciate the Cameraman/Camerawoman, The angles of the Camera are very decent and clear.\n",
      "Compared to the \"peace and love\" situation in Chinese movie, Korean movie is bold and willingly to talk about the black side of the society.\n",
      "The class difference is bigger and bigger in both China and Korea. And it is difficult for people to jump from lower classes. This situation has been shown in this movie, however, it is not the main point of it. The greed of the family is what really matters.\n",
      "The shooting scene is marvelous. It is difficult for you to be surprised when people can be like cockroaches when they are found to parasite at others' home. They are afraid of being found and light. The stair is shown several times to show the great difference between classes.\n",
      "It is enjoyable to watch this movie, to wonder how it goes and be amazed when the entrance of the secret basement is disclosed.\n",
      "If this movie wasn't the top movie that its name is telling the entire story then at least it's one of the top five!\n",
      "The idea is totally new and it's just exceptional\n",
      "It was recommended it to me by a friend and I would recommend it to everyone in return!\n",
      "Besides excellent plot, directing,.. This movie also has incredible hidden excellent cinematography!\n",
      "This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in recent years. The acting and story are phenomenal. I was also shocked to see this got best picture things are changing for the better in the Academy. This is an amazing film anyone should see.\n",
      "The Oscars made me wonder - as all of the wealthiest people I can picture sat in a room and clapped for it - did we all watch the same movie?\n",
      "Did every rich person who saw this movie come out of it feeling okay?\n",
      "Please let me know. Because for me, the visceral point, the sweat you could smell on your born-poor self afterwards was gut wrenching.The advertising for this movie was misleading, it looked like it would be scary somehow, or a very serious drama, and I was delighted to see that it wasn't, that it was clever and beautiful and funny and not too self serious.Bong Joon-Ho is obviously a very clever writer and director, these performances were natural with just a small wink at the camera, and the set design was beyond beautiful. 150% worth watching again.\n",
      "2 years after its debut in 2019 and I'm just now getting around to watching Parasite. Where to start... when people talk about creating art that drags you in and doesn't let go, this is what they're speaking of. The level of suspense throughout the whole film while showing hints of genre after genre after genre really makes this a class act. With numerous twists and turns, this movie is a professional jaw dropper. To you who is about to take part in this experience, congratulations!\n",
      "After this movie bagged the most coveted oscar,I finally decided to watch this movie.\n",
      "The first hour went well with the tight plot and realistic situations and performance by the characters but somehow it lost its grip in the second half and characters strangely appeared overdoing. Finally the climax of the movie totally turned out to be a big disappointment. I would have preferred 1917 or Ford vs Ferrari to win the accolades. Even Joker or once upon a time in Hollywood would have been a better choice.\n",
      "Everyone will like some part of this movie . The story is great with a lot of plot twists but because of that being a very important part of the movie, it doesn't work for a second watch. Still amazing movie.\n",
      "The director played out a story about class differences. How funny the first half is, how sad the middle is, how scary the end is. The skillful director's skill and precise and powerful script make the movie watching effect the most amazing I have seen for many years. The problem with this movie is that the poor are kind and the rich are good. People of different classes are doing things that are very in line with their own identity, so this kind of superficial goodness can not be the bridge of contradictions at all, only make the contradictions deeper and deeper.\n",
      "This is the perfect film. Subjectively speaking I may have enjoyed Joker equally however from an objective standpoint it is extremely plain to see it was the rightful winner of its Oscar for best picture and WITHOUT A DOUBT the most original. Awesome Movie. Clearly describe the reality of our current world.\n",
      "This movie is one of the most unique I have seen. The ending is definitely one you will remember. The combination of the whole film and the ending leaves you on thoughts and gives a feeling you may have never experienced. I highly recommend this movie. Absolute masterpiece!\n",
      "An original dark comedy about class struggles A cordial invitation to welcome this Parasite gem in the 21st century full of remakes and reboots. Very interesting plot! Really good movie.\n",
      "This movie plot shows us about the interaction between two families in which one poor family acts as parasite to the one rich family.\n",
      "The plot of this story is appreciating with a new concept.\n",
      "Could have given 100 on 10\n",
      "This is one of the greatest movie of this decade\n",
      "Maybe I dont understand how to watch a movie or rest of the world dont understand how to watch a movie. I'm on the side of this movie is overrated movie. This film not deserve Oscar or something. Movie get all the awards because of there is a little political message. I will give hint also Kim jong-un\n",
      "One of the greatest screenplays I have ever seen wow just wow.\n",
      "It is a masterpiece movie. In the movie we see the difference classes in society and the behavior of the people of this society. One class people straggling for some food and other class has it even much than their need. Most of the thing of this movie we can compare with our real life. Really like this movie.\n",
      "This movie is excellent and unique. The entirety of the film is like a puzzle that fits perfectly. This movie is intense and exciting. A perfectly crafted lie that is created too hastily and greedily and ruined just as quickly. The bigger they are the harder they fall and the path to success has no shortcuts.\n",
      "Seen the Movie two times one in January and other recently in April. It really is a great movie although my mother hated it and was asking why it won the Oscar. I think this movie is a masterpiece as it all drama,comedy,terror,mistery it makes you go on an emotion rollercoaster , it makes you think about your life about desperation when you have nothing etc.. . Such a great movie that will perdure a long time.\n",
      "What a film of our time! It is the perfect film . It has everything.\n",
      "I remember seeing it in a packed cinema early Jan 2020. It is a work of beauty and says so much about our world now.\n",
      "I've never seen such a different movie in the genre before. I don't know what to feel. It was just so good. It was really good.\n",
      "Such a amazing film. Impeccable and intelligent story that takes a strategic turn throughout the film.\n",
      "Simply for me its the worst movie of Bong Joon ho. Plot has a multiple and serious goofs and all the screenplay seems to be a pretension for the director/writer to express all of his ideas about injustice and cruelty of modern Korea and of course the world. In order to do that in good cinematic manner, a writer should first write a good screenplay that the plot twists come from the characters and believable situations and then the director visualizes it in his point of view to accomplish his ideas, something we saw in great Ken Loach movie, \"I, Daniel Blake\".I exampled this movie because it has same theme about injustice. Of course Bong Joon ho is a great writer/director and i love \"Memories of Murder\",\"Mother\" and \"Snowpiercer\", but after seeing this movie i was disappointed,as simple as that!\n",
      "Being a great fan of Dark Comedy Movies...I loved the film. It deserves all the osacars and all awards it received. An amazing film to watch. I have seen it again and again and looks like lots of things to learn in this film. Congratulations to the creators of this great piece of art.\n",
      "Simply exhilarating! As a long time lover of classical music and a sucker for delicate frame composition and well-thought-out cinematography, I couldn't have asked for a better representation of all three.The film is well-orchestrated and at times you are not sure if you are at a classical concert or in a movie theater. The plot is tangible whether you align yourself more with the Kim or Park family. Frame composition is painstakingly crafted to deliberately imply the status of one family above the other or separate from them. Acting is stylistically directed in alignment with the tempo of the film. By the end, you are not sure where you stand within the plot and who you relate to more and maybe that's a good sign, a sign that the film was well-written.I simply can't think of anything I did not like about this film and that's why I highly recommend it to any movie lover, or even more to aspiring filmmakers like myself. There is a lot to be learnt and even more to be enjoyed.\n",
      "To think of such story is intelligent! This is a masterpiece, totally Oscar worthy! It has a strong message, that greed lands you nowhere. Also, everything and everyone is running after worldly pleasure, and no matter how much petty a rich man can feel for the poor, they always look upon them like som down trodden untouchable stinky filth. The highlight of the movie is its uncanny realistic background! This is every other south asian country, where class parity is so much!\n",
      "What an amazing, clever movie. It definitely deserves all of the awards it has gotten!\n",
      "I saw the other film of Bong Joon-ho \"Memories of a murder\" and seince that day i wached every movies that i could from Joon-ho and the other directors from his country. He taught me that no mater where are you from and no mater what is your background. All people around the world have the same questions about their life. After watching this movie you do not know who was the parasite. I even thought myself as a parasite..\n",
      "I can only call this great movie as a masterpiece.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this film, it is such an interesting look at what one is willing to do to get out of poverty. Everything I look for in a dark comedy.\n",
      "This is not a good film at all..every thing on this file is wrong..at least people do bad things do win..what the point writer want to prove. so poor movie. i rate this as 2/10\n",
      "When watching this movie, I had absolutely no idea what was it about, and it sure surprised me. The film is just a masterpiece, each scene, everything has a meaning. And in the end, when you for a moment believe that the family was together again. It suddenly destroys your hope with the ending scene, in a semi-basement, without any way to get out of there. Beautiful in a way, and sad in another.\n",
      "One of those movies you can't look away from. I have watched it three times and it was equally enjoyable each time. Absolutely beautiful shot and edited, the writing and acting is excellent. The movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat every second of it and take turns that you never saw coming. One of the best of the decade.\n",
      "That ending was so crazy. Great film with lots of suspense.\n",
      "This movie absorbs its audience form start to finish. Easy to connect with the characters. I strongly recommend watching this to those who have limited time to waste on movies that need nowhere.\n",
      "With an incredible story, message/commentary and direction, \"Parasite\" is truly an Oscar Best Picture winner film. Giving a few laughs at the beginning and a sudden change in tone in the middle, this movie will terrify you not because the film provides gore or has ghosts, but because of the thought that these events can happen in real life.\n",
      "Best Film I have seen this year by a country mile and I have seen a lotA well deserved Best Film, Best Director, Original Screenplay ( Academy Award ) and Palme d'Or etc etc etcTurn off your phone and other distractionsEnjoy!\n",
      "A veiled approval of violent interaction between the 'classes' this is an incredibly disturbing movie which should NEVER have been granted Best Picture as the first Foreign language film to get that acclaim. Claims of stealing the plot are still under legal review. SHAME on the Academy for this dirty little movie...others of the year were far more deserving\n",
      "* SPOILERS *this isnt meant to be helpful i just wanna give it 10 stars lmaoi remember seeing this on the airplane not knowing the hell i was going into ... yet i felt so satisfied at the end.. I DO think that the son , its been a while since ive watched it again , wasnt able to get the house. since the imagery of him in such a suit and seeing his dad all in his letter. i mean bong joon ho did pan the camera back to the son just at their sewer home. but hey thats for u to figure out 👀\n",
      "During the Coronavirus Quarantine I've watch this movie although it's in Korean i still liked the movie.\n",
      "Parasite is the kind of movie that can take place in multiple movie genres. Like Dark comedy, thriller, a slight horror, mystery etc.All the characters are awesome and this movie shows the that Rich and Poor have a parasitic relationship with each other. Social class discrimination between the two results in horrific results.Bong Jun-Hoo did his best to show the sad reality of a Metropolitan city in which there are huge class differences. His efforts resulted in The First Non-English Movie to win 'Best Picture Oscar'.Truly impressive and thought provoking.\n",
      "Again, flawless, mind boggling and genius, I'm out of words\n",
      "This film is amazing. I don't even know where to start! My attention was captivated the entire time - character development, plot development, cinematography, writing, everything was phenomenal. A brilliant take on classism (among other themes) that can be applied to an incredibly wide range of cultures, as well as life situations. To write anything more would spoil it... just watch this film!\n",
      "I can't believe I watched this film till the end. I kind of understand the metaphorical view of the director. There's no connection between scenes. In the first 20 minutes I tried really hard not to feel bored but I didn't make it. Frankly, I don't understand why this film was nominated not for an Oscar, but even for the last of the awards. Total waste of time.\n",
      "All I can say is this film was very well thought out on the acting, editing, directing, and just general storytelling. Love the diversity and highly recommend to watch!\n",
      "I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'.\n",
      "With his easy control of time and space, Feng Junhao's interlinked parasitic relationship between a poor and a rich family constitutes a social fable of the \"parasite\" against the antagonism and differences between the rich and the poor. In this sad and happy story, the film is not only seen from the despair and helplessness of the lower class, but also hits the nail on the heart of the class contradiction.\n",
      "If you give this any less than 10/10 you have missed something and need to watch it again.\n",
      "The story\n",
      "The title\n",
      "The acting\n",
      "The theme\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "My first exposure to korean cinema, off course after the wide International acclaim it received.\n",
      "Everything aside this movie deserves evedy bit.\n",
      "To take such a subject and majority of the movie shot in a house with such good acting\n",
      "The director and the whole team stand out\n",
      "Not many films in the past 10 years have made as strong of an impression as Parasite. The commentary of capitalism and the division of class and how it tears apart all families involved even shines through this growingly dark drama. Although, not an American film, its universal themes still amplify the ubiquity of a global issue.\n",
      "I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.\n",
      "Two families of people; one poor, poorly educated; unemployed, and willing to lie to get money. The other wealthy, loving family, existing in their own world. What happens when they cross paths? Well, for one, a weird ending that didn't fit w/the rest of the story.\n",
      "Overall impression: I'm not going to remember this movie unlike, first & foremost, \"The Lighthouse\", then \"Once Upon a Time ...\", \"Joker\", and \"Judy\". Relative to the those creations I'm not sure why this movie garnered so many awards.\n",
      "The Parasite is a great movie with a great start. The story is interesting from the beginning. It is interesting to see how a poor family is slowly entering the environment of the rich. The beginning is a typical drama. But the ending is weird and I don't really know if it suited me for the whole film. The duel and murder at the end would not have to be there in my opinion, and some more meaningful ending would make the film more saddle. 8/10.\n",
      "Even though somewhat too dramatic, I do really enjoy this movie.Most of the scenes and plots are well organized and designed, and also several key points about humanity.\n",
      "This says a lot about society.That's all I have to say.\n",
      "To be honest, I'm a little disappointed. It's a really clever, really good story, with all the twists and turns, and the actors are really good. But in the end, it fell into the usual pattern of Korean films. Now you can understand why the director said you couldn't tell the story, because if you did, it would be a lot less entertaining. Satire, dry humor, reflection on social problems, all of these are felt.\n",
      "One of the best movies I've seen in a while. As soon as I learned it was from the same director Snowpiercer, I knew I had to watch it. Plot twists, great story telling, and stunning visuals are just a few reasons I enjoyed this film so much.\n",
      "Love this story, characters, humor. Everything in this movie is perfect. There's no question tags, doubts. When you are thinking that everything what could happen just happened something new appears.\n",
      "I strongly recommend this to everyone.This film talks about the different class of people and it was very well written and directed and the acting was great too. The film created suspense very well and those who like to analyse a film in a deeper level would also love this movie. This film had lots of meaning in it and if you were to rewatch the film, you will notice certain substantial things in the story you missed at first watch.\n",
      "Spoilers. don't be fooled. this is not a brilliant satire about the \"real\" south korea. it's really a horror movie dressed as quality. violence and cruelty abound.\n",
      "Happening once every dacade , strong story , amazing acting and a very good pictures\n",
      "For most of us this one is first ever experience of South Korean movie\n",
      "And it is amazing experienceMovie introduces us to the culture of\n",
      "S Korea. Which is similar to. many Asian countries and something are new to usAs the movie name is Parasite.\n",
      "Movie depicts rawness. That every human being contains parasite deep downMovie is brilliant in every aspects.\n",
      "Parasite has. Comedy ; fun ; sadness ; brutality ; depressing ; family bonding ; intimacy ; strictness ; thrilling ; darkness etc...Movie is good. You never loose the grip from the screen and story.\n",
      "When I started watching this I thought well here is a caption film and I haven't watched one in a while. I fully expected that because of the captions I would lose track of the story. Then, as I got into this film, I realized I was being drawn into the social fabric of South Korea. I appreciated it more and more as the film moved on.We have a desperate family living in a basement. The son has a friend whose leaving for college in America. His friend asks him to tutor his girlfriend while he is away at school because he trusts him. The girlfriend has a wealthy upper middle class family. So on his classmate recommendation he gets the job.Then the son finds he can get his entire family jobs with his new employer as well. So pretty soon the desperate family is all working and getting involved with the employers family. The social consequences of this become more and more complex as the desperate family is not telling their employers they are all related to each other. The wealthy family has many issues of it's own as well.Character development here is excellent and key to this as their relationship becomes more and more complex. Everything is going well until one week-end when the middle class family is taking their youngest son camping for a week-end. Then we find out some dark hidden secrets of their house as their employees decide to have a party at the employers house. Then the employees find out about a dark hidden secret in their employers house and everything starts falling apart for both families.I don't want to get too technical here because even though I warn for spoilers, I would rather the complexity of these social interactions are better if you see them for yourself, than my getting too detailed describing them. This is great writing and direction of a very complex social order story. It teaches the viewer about South Korean Culture and South Korea in a way that is unexpected, but very welcome. While the results of everything coming apart might not make some viewers happy, the way it happens when things come apart make total sense. There is some mild adult material here, but it is done milder than many R rated films.All the cast fit their roles and get plenty of chance to act. They really make the viewer feel what is going on and where complex relationships have to wind up. The title is a give away in that the desperate family does become parasites to the wealthy family. The way it happens is what makes this movie special. Kudos to all the folks who have given this movie awards. It deserves all of them. The film takes the viewer into a different world, and does so in a unique manner.\n",
      "This movie is 100% AWESOME! I now understand all the hype...All the awards this movie has won is well deserved!!! Awesome...awesome...awesome film!!! Watch it you will not be sorry!!!\n",
      "Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script.The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful.Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10.\n",
      "I get it. The film's good. Very good. Best picture amongst english speaking films???? Why??????? Fine. Let it win the best film in the foreign film category. Some weird political shenanigans going on there. \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\". The film, even with subtitles, keeps you immersed and forgetting that \"time has flown by\" which you want from a cleverly crafted movie. The film gently builds to an almighty OMG. What else could you want??. Well done to everyone involved in the movie.\n",
      "This is a remarkable film of the century which depicts many social issues we confront everyday such as class system, racism, global warming, gap between the rich and the poor and discrimination against poverty along many other social issues that we face everyday. Director Bong Joon-Ho has dealt with various topics as such in his previous films yet this film has the best story telling and cinematography as seen. This film deserves global attention not just for film lovers but for all in which we can all relate one way or another to criticise what needs attention and correction in our society. Recommend to all genre of movie lovers as this has hints of humour, comedy, action as well as drama.\n",
      "Now I understand why Trump said: 'What the hell was that about?'\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best movies ever made. It is a visually stunning movie where Hong Kyung-pyo has done phenomenal work with the cinematography. The actors in the movie are all great and live up to their expectations. The movie is funny and entertaining, but at the same time relatively dark. This movie will not make you bored!\n",
      "Two poor families, one not lucky in money gathering,other one unlucky in social experience. That's what parasites do, they find most vulnerable people, who has no immune developed against them, who never met them before and use their healthy trust. I thought Birdman will be a far leader on the best movie of decade, but this Korean dreamteam jumped to the bus and almost made driver to give up his seat. Lines with preexisting diseases changed after new parasites arrived killed it at the end.\n",
      "Will be waiting for next one with wet lips.\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho and his long awaited rise to masterclass. Without doubt this director has a cabinet that cripples some of the historically best, but has been underestimated for over a decade. Parasite does what so many others cannot achieve. Successful genre-twisting, combing elements of classical horror, dark humour and enriching drama so successfully that you'd think it's a class of its own. The performances are looked over simply because, and I say this cautiously, the best movie direction seen in my lifetime.Fantastic story, fantastic everything!\n",
      "Rare 10. WOW!\n",
      "One of the most intense films. The second half of the movie was just so great. Started with comedy and I loved the wits of them they literally hired the whole family! There were so many twists as well. A secret chamber or whatever it was called and the maids husband.\n",
      "The rich family's way of looking at athe poor and the comparisons of the situations this movie is damn straight amazing!!\n",
      "Funny, light, thoughtful, deep, suspenseful, dark, all the thingsVery intelligent film that weaves together many different perspectives and tones masterfully. Several different levels to think about and discuss with others. It will leave you thinking about it for days afterward just to ponder it a bit more. Definitely tell your friends to watch it because you'll want someone to discuss it with. This is a full-course dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied :)\n",
      "Parasite is amazing not the just the story or the acting the whole direction and camera work and the added thriller it the only movie i have seen which has so many genres mixed it movie to be watched at least once by everybody it is stellar\n",
      "After reading several great reviews of this movie, i had to see it.Hated it from start to finish.I love \"out of the box\" movies... the weirdest, the better.\n",
      "This is just dull.\n",
      "No good actingwaht so ever.\n",
      "Good story but the guy in the basement?! Really??Not believable, to say the least.\n",
      "And the rich mother? Just to stupid to be convincing.Just my opinon, but if you like good acting, don't watch this.Just one of those trendy movies everyone loves to love, to be in aline with the supposedly \"intelectually advanced\" reviewers out there.\n",
      "I am writing this almost straight after watching, I feel I probably need more time to process the whirlwind of a film i just watched but it was truly great.The build up of the plot, tension and the characters is great. You find yourself guessing where this is going at various times. There were some minor breadcrumbs along the way, intentional or not your guess is as good as mine.The fact that we were guessing where this was heading was a great thrill alone but the action and climax was great when it finally arrived. The soy sauce on the pizza was a sign of bloodshed in my opinion but even at this point I was unsure on what form it would be delivered to us, and from whom. It was a 'fasten your seatbelt' moment.it was a dark film but done in a way which made you chuckle along the way, and cheering for the family despite the fact that are committing multiple crimes against a completely innocent family. When you step back its quite a terrifying thought and in no way should we be cheering these people on, but I was!The little hits of comedy took the edge off and gave us light breather, even towards the end, despite the craziness and drama unfolding we managed to chuckle at a smalls dogs unconventional snack. I love the ending, having something left to you own interpretation like that is something a lot of people do not like but I for one like it and find it genius.Overall I loved it, for its uniqueness (which is always welcome) the tension the drama, the dark comedy. I would thoroughly recommend.My only question, where the hell is Min?Film 7\n",
      "Never seen a movie like this before. It was brilliant.\n",
      "Very much enjoyable, loveable and heart warming piece of art. But the end didn't match with the flavour of the movie and came to me as if a beautiful road trip has ended with a crash but still its a must watch.\n",
      "The film Parasite has a simple story produced in the simplest of ways. I liked the cast and also how they fit into the characters. One thing I felt the film could have done better could have been to put more background for both the families which could have made the story more clear.\n",
      "This movie contains all the aspects that a good movie should have. Happy times, sad times, freaky times, surprising times, scary times, exciting times and funny times. All the aspects are checked in my book and they are so well put together and blended to a perfect experience. It was totally believable and also very amazing. The whole plot of the movie was just so good, I could never have come up with it myself.\n",
      "I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. \"Shattered glass\", \"Catch me if you can\", \"Bling ring\". Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing.\n",
      "With a great mundial attention, Parasite surprise evertyone win 4 orcars against favorites movies like 1917 (Sam Mendes) and The Irishman (Martin Scorcese), and all of this is not for nothing: Parasite is a refletion about politics scenario about misery, social inequality and other social problems that aren't be seen, mainly in a country like South Korea that is always showed like a technology and science power without any social problem (that is deny in Bong Joon-ho film).\n",
      "Like as all movie that talk about humanities contrast and inequality, Parasite is a relation between Kim family and Park family: the fisrt lives in a house basement and the second family lives in a beautiful and big mansion in a elite neighbourhood. In addition focus in scenes that show the both ambients, the movie has another way to show the inequality between Kim and Park: Kim and Park are two of three of most popular and communs surnamens is South Korea, however, Kim is most commun (21% of koreans) than Park (9%).\n",
      "The contrast in the reality not only in South Korea, but alround the world, is not realized by Kim family when they are work in many funtions in Park mansion, as like they are part of the Park family. The lack of class awareness in a group that feel privileged by an elite that always oppressed is showed when Choong-sook say \"she isn't poor\" to Moon-gwang, the last Park housekepper, when she founds Moon-gwang's husband in basement.\n",
      "There'is a discussion about is the \"parasite\" in movie is about Kim family, that lives in Park home illegaly, or about Park family, that explore the work of Kim with the inequality. Actuallity, the parasite is about the actions of the both family and, in same time, is the envy, the greed and the preconception that kill Kim- jeong and Nathan Park. Therefore, Parasite has a many interpretations about an only mensage\n",
      "All of the adventure vivenced by Kim started with a rock brought by Min, Ki-woo's friend, that is an amulet very commun in asian countries that bring lucky to families. This object is very important to undestand the movie because many events in movies is about it and it construct slowly the social context of movie: The first event is a Choong-sook commentary when Min brings the amulet, when she say: \"It would be better if is was food\", showing that the basic necessites is most importante than religion. The second event is when Ki-woo go down the basement to give the amulet to Moon-gwang and Geun-sae like a gift, but the man almost kill the boy blow to the head, and the third, and the last, event about this amulet is when the rock is returned to river, like Kim family is returned to misery after the happening in Dae-song party. In any moment in the movie, the amulet is showed like a religious object that can save somebody of poorness and misery, but is showed only like a material object, the same manner that capitalism sees the world and the same manner that inequality and poorness is in the world, a fisical and real problem. As Kim-Ki-taek said: \"That's the reason that people can't be have a plan. Without plan, nothing can't be wrong\".\n",
      "The Parasite is very close to what I would consider a perfect movie -- I mean, it's technically, scripted, and performed at a fairly high level of artistry, but it's also something that most mainstream audiences would definitely enjoy, even for someone with a busy work and family life who just wants to relax and enjoy a movie.\n",
      "This movie depicts the cultural hints of inequality and respect present in most Asian cultures beautifully. To a certain degree, the 1% disregards the human rights of the help and considers them as just parasites; creatures that will do anything for a paycheck. Subsequently, money is the determinant of cultural status-not identity nor character. The conservative nature of this feudalistic mentality is brought to light with this movie, to which Bong Joon-ho metaphorically uses a symbiotic relationship between the two families. With Parasite, he suggests an egalitarian approach to status and respect, in which uncommonly practiced in today's globalized Asian cultures. The movie does a great job in breaking the barriers and presenting this message!\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho (writer/director} is usually known for bashing the rich and powerful.. In this film he takes aim also at the poor who are depicted as conniving, immoral grifters. The Parks, the rich family who are the prey of the poor Kim family are shown as mostly naïve rather than cruel, The film is comedic for the first half and then takes a violent and serious turn. Riveting and thought provoke, highly recommended.\n",
      "PARASITE is that rare movie that works for both cinephiles and an audience seeking nothing more than an entertaining two hours. For me, this is the best sort of movie, giving the audience both food for thought and a great time. Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal.\n",
      "Three groups of families, a total of ten characters, everyone is indispensable. Put the furniture and structural features of a house to the extreme. The huge gap between the upper class and the bottom floor is materialized by the height of the living space. The scenes of going up and down the stairs repeatedly, though straightforward, are just right. What's terrible about the director is that he has excellent directing skills and the ability to write stories. When he conceives the plot, he always thinks about how to present it to the audience.\n",
      "Wow! Parasite is a great ride!!Although there was some grimness, it's not a horror flick, but a psychological thriller. The film paints with grandiose broad strokes using extravagance to tell a bigger story...a story about social inequality and the gullibility of people, particularly entitled acting rich foks. The story crawls into your mind and leaves you pondering.PS. Can I just say that I'm sickened by the fact that the rich husband & wife have matching pajamas 🙄*Disclaimer: if anyone has matching pajamas with their significant other, my apologies 😆\n",
      "I'm utterly shocked with this whole situation of this oscar winning movie and it's reviews here. This movie is a total joke... Bad acting, hopelessly predictable and the humour of 10 year old kids. What is this craze? Is it a throw at political correctness? And people with no taste in movies uttering prechewed reviews that are totally untrue? Total Kafka.\n",
      "Fantastic storyline, a must watch for all movie buffs\n",
      "I went in thinking it would be completely over-hyped and that the park family would be archetypal immoral rich people, but all the characters were well rounded, and although I didn't share Mr. Kim's viewpoint it is completely understandable. Parasite got its message across without being textbook, rich-people-bad post-modernist drivel, I didn't feel like my class was being criticized for no reason. The whole 2nd half had my jaw on the floor and gripping my seat, while the 1st half had my laughing every few lines. This movie is well worth the watch, and entirely lived up to the hype\n",
      "A true masterpiece. first time i saw it as soon as it finished i rewatched it again. loved everything about it the director is a genius.\n",
      "At first the idea of a poor family full of con artists going after an upper class family seemed kinda been there done that sort of. I wasn't really into this at the start. Once it got to the halfway part, it took a very unexpected turn and the suspense kicked in big time. I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill, getting bigger and bigger and then BAM! because that climax was crazy. I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit, besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. Good choice here.\n",

      "A movie you'll have to do research on and find the little hidden things and messages, social themes are revolving around the film, one piece of the film connects to the other but, yet the characters remain distant in way of laying. A great film the beginning will have you wondering the ending will you have saying \"wow\".\n",
      "Truly, something to remember. Thank god we have good film makers left. Everything in place. I Only hated that I could not undertand language, liked to think that I picked something on the way.\n",
      "As someone who lived in Asia all their life, and ve seen lots and lots of asian cinematography, and korean as well, this right here is just plain and simple trash. My husband who is asian as well thinks that as well, a complete waste of time. It could only recieve such a high praise in the west. Overrated, pretensious, and ridicilous. How do you describe people's action with logic? You dont, cause there is none. If you think there is, think again. You must be thinking in steryotypes if you believe any people in asia would act anything like in the movie.\n",
      "I watched this film couple of months ago, so I'm not writing this review with a completely clear memory of everything that I loved about this movie. All I can say is that at least a week after watching it, I was still googling aaaaall the hidden meanings in certain scenes, all the interviews with the director, why they did some scenes in certain ways etc. This is how starstruck I was. Once I learned about all the layers, I could only conclude that this movie is a masterpiece! I had a class called \"Visual culture\" at my University and this movie would be perfect for the analysis of its visual language. And they show all the different relationships between rich and poor, happy and sad, right and wrong, in suuuuch a subtle way!! I really feel like people should write essays about this film.\n",
      "Excellent movie, must see period\n",
      "Story, acting, everything was perfect.\n",
      "I absolutely loved it. The twist at the end and how it ended really made it surprised. After a promising start, the film changes into a simplistic, cliche-ridden, predictable mess, filled with the graphic violence that's out of strictness of contemporary films.\n",
      "Throughout the whole movie i felt panic build up internally. This movie creates a feeling through the whole runtime that makes you want to turn it of to spare yourself. At the same time it grips you so tightly and you can't pull yourself away. In a decade or two we will look back at this movie in the same way we look back at \"Silence of the Lambs\" and such films. A true 10/10.\n",
      "This movie's story was brilliant, however, it felt rushed. I was confused about what the plot was until a little less than 90 minutes in, out of a 2+ hour movie. The real story it reveals is very engaging, but it doesn't start until at least 60-40 minutes in. From my understanding of the plot, there could have been at least 10 minutes cut short from the beginning, and the story would still be fine.It had trouble engaging me. The rising action wasn't \"rising\" for me until 10 minutes before the climax it felt. The ending and climax were worth it, but waiting two hours felt too long. If anyone could explain why some scenes are important, I'd love to know, but other than that, it's just good. Could have been better, and could have been worse. I do think this is a good movie to watch, and I do recommend it.\n",
      "Don't see the appeal in this movie at all was extremely predictably and a few things didn't add up. Why did he bring the rock downstairs? what happend to the crazy guy? Why did the dad kill the guy? Lots of things do not add up and the acting is sub par and the writing is sub par. Mediocre at best and one of the most overrated movies of all time\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho delivers greatness with this exploration of class warfare in South Korea.What I love most about this film is how the director does not preach to us a trite message about greed, envy, and inequality. In fact, neither the rich nor the poor in this film are treated like demons or saints - just people intersecting from their opposite ends of the social spectrum and all the chaos that comes with it.Mid-way, the film takes a crazy turn that you do not see coming and it becomes something else entirely. I will not give it away, but Bong Joon-Ho certainly knows how to keep the audience interested in what could have been a low-hanging fruit story about \"social justice.\"\n",
      "The film depicts two opposite sides of the huge gap between the rich and the poor without any strong conflicts. As representatives of the two classes, there is no direct hatred between the individual and the individual. It can even be said that uncle Kim's family is very grateful to representative park and thinks that Mrs. Park is simple and kind. The rich couple, on the other hand, did not specifically target the other class of people with any deliberately difficult and contemptuous. But there was still bad blood between the two classes, or between the two families.\n",
      "Maybe one day I'll come back and write a more eloquent review, but suffice to say having just seen this tonight, I think it's one of the best films I've seen in years. An almost indescribable satirical-drama-thriller that gets about everything pitch perfect and surprises at every turn.Bong Joon-ho really is a genius (even if Okja was terrible)!WATCH!\n",
      "A best Korea movie . It's a masterpiece. Must watch movie 👀\n",

      "This movie was incredible!Glad I saw this, and was introduced to this director through this movie.\n",
      "Parasite is a movie that hits you like a shock with its twist in the story.The movie starts with a lower class family and as we progress on we are introduced to a upper class family which is directly opposite in many way to the lower class family.This movie is an extraordinary piece of work. Everything from direction,writing,screenplay,production and performances of actors are amzing.I highly recommend this movie to everybody.A review by Jayesh Kumar.Date - 25/05/21.\n",
      "This is a film for film fans, who wants to see something interesting, new, brilleant, with oh my god feeling\n",
      "This is bloddy brilleant film\n",
      "Super direction, acting, and the production design\n",
      "This movie is magically from the beginning and thrilling until the end. It's so perfectly detailed and the plot just damn good. If you want to see some poor family just wanting to live a better life and be thrown into a moral dilemma about the consequences of lies you're right here. Every character is unique, the screenwriting is excellent, cinematography A+.\n",
      "The only thing is the somehow open end... or is it?\n",
      "Nope. I care nothing about these characters nothing. This is something happening in a lot of current film and television, the inability for me to care about the good or the bad characters. All these people's story are for me just average. I've seen these stories told before.The movie needed editing. Could have easily been 1.5 hours. The end seemed drawn out and rushed all at the same time.The camera work and color is beautiful. That's about it. Best picture...please give me a break.\n",
      "I used to think this movie is a tragedy but on a second watch I realised it's a  comedy. Clearly one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best thrillers of all time. The movie is very intelligent and very captivating. The pacing is very dynamic and the script is brilliant. The movie look beautifull, from production design to directing and cinematography everything was stunning. The set design express the social commentary about the difference between classes in very subtle and intelligent way. The ending was surprising in a good way.\n",
      "With the likable struggling family trying to make a living in a rough world and then keeps you attached with it's unconventional twists while using subtle symbolism to get its anti-capitalism message across.As an American who believes in the free market, and the \"American Dream\" of working hard, saving your money (the step people struggle the most with), then investing your money, and shooting for your goals with everything that you have, I appreciate it when movies that are critical of the economic system of capitalism which allows for their to be a larger wage disparity between the rich and the poor then other economic systems, doesn't feel the need preach its beliefs to you with elaborate speeches, but instead opts to let the story do the talking. However, the one exception in Parasite to this was the conversation in the gym that Ki-taek had with his son about plans. And it's this quote that really sticks out to me:\"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. No plan. You know why? If you make a plan, life never works out that way.\"This is an absolutely heartbreaking outlook to have on life and it can only truly be believed by a man who has let his circumstances defeat him. But at the same time, some people are just given the short end of the stick in life. They grow up in a bad situation and often times lack the education, the capability, the direction, drive, or the opportunity to pull themselves out of it. In the case of Ki-woo and his sister Ki-jeong, they clearly weren't lacking in capability or drive, but the lack of opportunity was implied which was why Ki-woo's friend Min-hyulk was a godsend to the family when he presented Ki-woo with the idea of him taking a tutoring position.What I find funny is that the father ends up acting on impulse when he hides in the basement and the situation of the film with a poor person living in the shadow of a rich person remains the same. On the flip side, the son says he has a \"fundamental plan\" in which he will go to a university, and make enough money to buy the house so he could free his father. At first, the movie tries to trick you into believing that he was able to do so and he is able to see his father again, but then it is revealed to be a more realistic and melancholic ending with Ki-woo hoping that he will be able to actually set out and do it, but never actually being able to do so. This is suggesting that in a capitalistic society, those on the bottom have a hard time of rising to the top even when they have the drive and capability to do so.But me being the optimist that I am, I cannot accept such an ending. The reason that Ki-woo fails isn't because his dream isn't attainable, it's because he doesn't actually have a plan. Saying that you are going to go to a university and make lots of money is not a plan. That's a dream. Plans need to be thought out with smaller attainable goals set as stepping stones to reach that dream. And judging by the way Ki-woo was raised, he probably never had anyone show him how to break things down to properly execute a plan. That pains me because once Ki-woo gets some direction, he'd be able to find an opportunity to help get his family out of the rut they're in. Of course, in some cases, it's better for you to worry about #1 and to not let your family drag you down with you which is something that I've had to learn the hard way in my life...Overall, I am happy that this film won best picture, It was an original film with a brilliant script, great acting, and likable protagonists despite all of the horrific stuff that they do. But what I think is even more noteworthy is that Parasite is an anti-capitalist film which portrays rich people as people. And I respect Bong Joon-ho for pulling that off especially when I felt that the biggest flaw in his previous film Okja was that he was anything but subtle with how he portrayed his antagonists. Parasite doesn't have antagonists. It has a working class of characters that are struggling to make a living and a higher working class of characters that is oblivious of the struggles of those that are beneath them.\n",
      "Was absolutely blown away by this movie. Some scenes had me crying with laughter and some scenes made me sit on edge.Knew this movie would be good but the storyline is so funny but also so unique and clever and it just keeps getting better and better with larger plot twists. The movie is also quite easy to follow and isnt extremely complex. Had a lot of respect for Korean filmography and this has added to that respect a lot.Looking forward to see what Bong comes up with next for sure\n",
      "The cinematic excellence of this film is one of a kind. It has such an original approach to its meaning and thought process for each scene. This film is one like no other. The fact that it has subtitles adds to the raw feeling and authenticity of the film. Giving each character a real element. It has so many genuinely intelligent plays, you have to watch it more than once to explore its excellence. The first time you watch it, you will be captured by the emotional and breathtaking journey it takes you on, and then the second time, you will be able to appreciate the brilliance of each mirrored scene, each tactical foreshadow and each hint that as a first time watcher you would be sure to miss. It has an outstanding, in-depth analysis and projection of the upper and lower class separations; each one of these being shown throughout and uniquely. Highly, highly recommended, I will keep this film as one of my greats for a long long time.\n",
      "I don't review movies on IMDB but when I do they are mostly for the exceptional ones in my opinion. That said, there is a notion that Oscar winning movies are overhyped and though I feel there's some truth to that....this movie is an outlier! This movie deserved the \"Best Picture\" award.On a side note, name a genre and this movie covers it comedy, thriller, drama, dark comedy, empathy. Hats off to the actors, producers and the director!\n",
      "What a wild ride. Everything was set up perfectly for our family's lie to crumble down, but I wasn't expecting it to happen when it did or how. The second half was a wild ride of emotions with everything paying off and taking a shocking turn. I loved how far the film was willing to go for its story. There was one scene that was too much for me but other than that, this was a great film. 9.5/10.\n",
      "Clever and darkly humorous, 'Parasite' is Bong Joon-ho all the way through, and he gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast, the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor - those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve; how being one or the other defines who you are, and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that. Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director's bleak outlook doesn't affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is.\n",
      "The movie does not establish humanistic values, depicting disgusting human sins.\n",
      "The Korean entourage makes it even more repulsive.\n",
      "I'm not sure why such a poor movie received so many high praises.\n",
      "To say the least this movie is brilliant. The class differences you can see with both sides of the family is really telling of the modern wealth inequality around the world. The rich family with a complete lack of perspective and respect for the other/main side of the family is very compelling and makes for this amazing story. One of the best movies ever made and it's ridiculously enjoyable start to finish. 10/10.\n",
      "Brilliant, deep, and leaves you on the edge of your seat! From comedy to horror to drama, I never thought a movie with subtitles could get me hooked like this one!\n",
      "This movie grabs your attention and never lets go. It thrilling to see the characters and learn about society from the interactions between the characters. Talk about endings too, a truly satisfying and unexpected wrap up.\n",
      "A well crafted film that does not confine itself to a genre. Equal parts thriller, drama, comedy, and suspense. While it is a scathing indictment on classism, it does an amazing job of condemning the institution and not necessarily the individual. It is in identifying with characters that Joon-ho really exposes the psychological hold economic class has on the individual and society. The pacing is brilliant, always engaging and playing with tempo nicely. Loved it.\n",
      "Whenever the Korean film industry gives a movie, it is sure to be the best as we can see with movies like snowpiercer and train to Busan, Parasite is just like that\n",
      "Parasite is a very well written movie It talks about power, greed and hope,it says that how humans are capitalist by nature, That a person only thinks about himself that when a poor family has power, they will not help other poor but will only think about themselves, There is a power hierarchy in the society and the one who has more power, he considers the one with less power as a filth. This film talk about privilege also that a higher class person gets everything but a lower class person has to work 10 times more to get that, Everything in this film was well balanced there is no villain in this film the real villain is the situation\n",
      "Yes bong didn't give any reason for \"all or nothing\" but that's the whole point that's why it feels surprising,The murder of Mar Park by Mar kim was a very psychological act,The murder of Mar Park by Mar Kim is very surprising and to understand it, you need to understand the psychology of Mar Kim.Kim never wanted to kill Park, it was the situation that led to this act,Jealousy and anger have already boiled over in Kim's mind against Park,And it's shown in a very subtle way,He used to respect the park a lot, but later he came to know that he just thinks of him as a worker who stinks alot This thing was deeply disturbing to Kim inside,A big truth was already revealed in front of Kim(secret bunker),And right after that he heard Mr. Park say about himself that he stinks, and later her whole house got washed away by the rain all trouble came upon him in one night Still, he has to go to work in the morning, where the Park family is about to enjoy a birthday party But still the park treats him like a worker wo stinks they are completely unaware of his problem,Even when geun se killed Kim's daughter, Park was only thinking about his son and he should logically think about his son first But Kim felt bad for this work of Park because of his hatred, when Park shrunk his nose to avoid the smell, then Kim felt worse,in that situation, his suppressed hatred and jealousy came out in the form of anger, which led to the murder of the park. Kim had no Big reason to kill Park and he never want to kill mr Park it just happened to him like a DREAM a BAD DREAM And he got punished for this because he did wrong he had to leave his family and stay in the bunker and later he also apologized to the park, but now nothing is going to happen with this apology, crime was already committed now he will have to atone for it ,this shows the jealousy and hatred of the lower class against the higher class, And the movie never justifies Kim's crime,Kim was not a psycho killer, he was a normal person, he committed this crime, which he regrets, but now nothing is going to happen by regretting,In the last, a conversation between a father and son is shown which is very emotional, a son will never consider his father a criminal He also knows that my father is not such a person, but nothing can happen now,In the end, the film ends on Hope, despite all this, ki woo never stops hoping,I don't know whether he will be able to get that house or not, but God bless him to buy such a house so that when it rains next time, he can enjoy it with his family like mr park does.Both families were not parasite in this film the real parasite was human greed,hatred, jealousy and situation.\n",
      "Depicts the life, thinking and work culture of people living in a slum in a very crude sense.\n",
      "I hate this movie. There is no story. What is the point? How this movie got an Oscar? Am I that stupid that I can't understand the \"art\" behind this movie? So many questions.\n",
      "Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like \"Breaking Bad\" it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!\n",
      "If you are wondering how the hell did a Korean Film win the Best Picture award at the Oscars, your doubts will all be cleared after watching the film just once ! The perfect mixture of all departments gives us a picture, strong both in narrative and filmmaking. The story touches upon the social lines between the poor and the rich and easily weaves it into the story. The production quality is top- notch and the actors do a really good job in conveying the emotions. This is a must watch for any cinephile and normal viewers alike.\n",
      "I am not someone who gives high high ratings. Seeing this film I now understand the awards it has one. This story transcends all cultures in all countries. The haves and the have nots. It exemplifies that it does not matter in the full realm how life ends up. The acting was superb and watching it in the original language made it so more realistic.\n",
      "It is said that parasite won the grand prize as a result of the unanimous approval of the jury. As Asians, I think Chinese fans will also be proud of it. Fengjunhao's efforts and creativity also prove to the world that genre films can do good-looking and artistic, which is the most important contribution of Korean films.\n",
      "The movie parasite has many aspects to look for. It shows a new way to perceive you everytime you see it. But maybe the most relavant aspects is of it's political perspective. The movie throwout its storyline shows a series of scenes and act that portrays modern day society. In present times it's noteworthy that the differences of classes is real, and with time the difference of class is growing more and more. Capitalism has rooted it's way into almost everything and anything.The whole movie meaningfully describes two properties of capitalism, rather specifically neoliberal capitalism, these are \"Cool Capitalism\" and \"Cultural Hegemony\".The former is stated by Jim Mcguigan in his \"The coolness of capitalism today\". It describes the way the rich are unaware or rather ignorant about the actual condition of the society and that about the condition of the not so privileged.\n",
      "In the movie, there's a scene where Mr. Kim is driving, and in the backseat there's Mrs Park, who says yesterday's night was a pleasant one, in a parallel scene one can see the devastation on the poor. Another example is in the same scene where Mrs Park says there's a bad smell, and this increaes as the movie goes on. Mary Douglass states \"There's no things as absolute dirt, it exists in the eyes of the beholder\", i.e its a social sature that is used to prove someone lesser than someone else. This part shows how the rich are unaware of the cost or labour given for their privileges by people who are below them in this capitalist society. This sums up as a fact that the people benifited by this capitalist system often distance themselves from the have nots both metaphorically and physically. They don't want to smell anything that will remind them of poverty or maybe on which they are feeding.The effects of late capitalism is the ever growing distance between the rich and the poor even in aspect of culture and lifestyle. Antonio Gramsci calls this as the Cultural Hegemony.\n",
      "Throwout the movie Mr. Park describes about a line that he always keeps and loves to kept by any of his employees between him and them. He describes this as \"professionalism\" but what this actually means is that he cuts out a division to maintain his status of supiority. Cultural hegemony which favours the rulling class, always teaches to aspire the supirior. This can be seen in present day advertisement, and how everyone wants to acquire the dominant status. The same is portrayed in the movie by the scene where the poor family gets a chance to live in the Park house and enjoys themselves as the rich.The very end of the movie shows us a scene where Ki-woo has earned enough money to buy the rich house and afterall free his father, however this momentary happiness is dissolved as its reveiled that it was just as aspiration made by boy in a letter to his father. Furthermore in an interview Bong Joon-ho says keeping in mind the family's economic condition, it would take 564 year to buy that house. This is contrary to the idea of capitalism in America that \"A little hardwork can get you anything you want to achieve\", although the reality is that the rich gets richer in an illusion of social mobility. In the end part of the movie, after all the horor is gone, it is seen that the rich gets off from all the trouble, but the poor is trapped and diseased. In this society the poor are often faced with competition and struggle and are forced to fight between themselves for their living but theirs no attempt or ability to overthrow the prevailing system of domination.This is also portrayed beautifully by the scene where the two poor families fight to get a hold of the phone and thus make their stay in the house.Thus to sum everything up, its to be said that if one looks at the movie in a normal way it is shown how the poor is feeding up on the rich, i.e the poor are the parasites to rich.\n",
      "But if one is intelligent enough, it can be pointed out that the rich are comparebly more parasitic to the poor. The poor are often poor because the capitalist system (companies) is unwilling to compensate fair wages for them in order to maximize their own profits.\"Capitalism has neither the capacity, nor the morality, nor the ethics to solve the problems of poverty.\"Fidel Castro\n",
      "The movie had a constant sense of elevation. Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, they did. Somehow though, it all feels super realistic. That's the power of pacing. Recommended.\n",
      "Movie was ok. Mostly about people who are maintenance seekers in the life and how they con a simple and vulnerable family, who paid the price for being straight.\n",
      "Anyway suspence was good but it left a lot to be desired. If there was some hidden message other than what I said then we'll I missed something.\n",
      "It was amazing!!!\n",
      "a movie that molded con artistry/heist vibes, comedy, horror, suspense, psychological, and horror into a striking cinematic experience that can't be replicated. The only reason I didn't give a ten was I wish the ending was different but that's a personal opinion. full respect to the director, marvelous movie.\n",
      "With Parasite, director Bong Joon Ho has served up over two hours of fascinating story played out by interesting characters on beautifully crafted sets. At no point during those two hours did my attention wander, but at several junctures I realized that my pulse was racing (in a very good way).As with any film - \"your mileage may vary\" - but I cannot imagine that many folks would not enjoy Parasite. It's fantastic.\n",
      "While I'm not finished with the film as I right this, this film is a social study of the wealthy and the destitute. A poor family systematically infiltrates a wealthy family, essentially taking over the house in a sense. I have a feeling that this won't end well.\n",
      "Partly because i had to read the movie. No but seriously, wow, one of those movies that you just never want to end. So many things about this movie that is pleasing. From beginning to end, the movie is absolutely jam packed with stimulation. Deception, violence, unpredictability, bits of arousal, cultural reference, so much comedy, and an ending that definitely does not disappoint. From 1/8th in until the end, you'll just constantly be saying OMG. This movie was definitely deserving of best picture, perhaps even one of the best of the decade. I saw this about a week after I saw Joker, which was also amazing, and similarly disturbing. However, Parasite is just a masterpiece.\n",
      "One of the best hollywood movies ever watched so far. Be it the Casts, Acting, Cinematography, Plot, Locations all were excellent. I will rate this movie 10/10. This is was such a movie which will remembered lifetime,\n",
      "This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. The Protagonist hailing from a poor background gives a legendary performance in this film and is absolutely awestruck. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.One of the best things about this movie is that it's so relatable and showing the contrast of poor and rich which the director has chosen the location/sets perfectly . Regardless of your embarrassing situation, the actors has probably gotten into something worse.Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a emotions in the end . If you're looking for a unique movie with surprise twists and turns, this is undoubtedly the movie for you.\n",
      "What, an Eddie Murphy comedy from 1982 compared to the Palme D'Or winning \"Parasite\"? Yes, because both are excellent class-distinction films but mirrors of each other.Trading Places has likable characters that, faced with Fate (the evil Duke brothers), team up to defeat the bad guys at their own game. Even the homeless black con-man Billy Ray Valentine--who is a completely decent man--can work with privileged, out of touch white Ivy Leaguer Winthorp--who is a completely decent man--and respect each other, to beat the Dukes. An American movie: an optimistic, improbably fairy tale of the American Dream.Parasite, on the other hand, has unlikable characters who have no way out of their predicament. The poor Kim family actually *aspire* to be like Billy Ray Valentine, because they have no choice in a culture like Korea's. And the Parks--basically Winthorp--cannot once consider the Kims to be human beings worthy of respect. So instead of everyone ending up on a beach eating cracked crab, we have a bloody murder scene in the back yard.\n",
      "I think the best movie of 2019. The movie keeps you with every character, every event, every moment.\n",
      "This movie is so over hyped. I WANTED to love this movie. But as soon as I saw the Palm D'Or logo at the beginning of the movie I knew they were telling me I was supposed to like it and find it intellectual. I didn't. Still don't. The dialogue was bad. The story was meh and none of the tension came from between characters. The most tense movie came from when they were hiding under the table in a will they or won't they be found. Honestly, the same scene played out in Jurassic Park but with the dinosaurs vs the humans. I actually like Jurassic Park more.\n",
      "Wow. Definitely deserved the Best Picture Win at the Oscars!Totally not what I thought it was going to be. But great, despite having to read the subtitles the whole film..\n",
      "Everything here is perfect. From the characters, plot, theme, music, jokes, cinematography and all.\n",
      "I have seen this movie 5-6 times now and have shown it to 4 of my friends. This movie is a masterpiece. Acting, Directon, Story, Screenplay, Cinematography everything is top notch. This director's work is amazing and I cannot wait for his next film. Just watch it!\n",
      "Many layered, brilliantly directed and acted. This has it all. Poverty, wealth, deception, comedy, horror, greed, humility, twists, double-crossing, life lessons.... Keeps you guessing throughout. The film's strongest attribute, is the interaction of the characters and how there lives intertwined and impacted on each other.\n",
      "Parasite is the best film I have seen in a while. I am so glad that It has won numerous awards. No many films expose the inequality among social classes and climate change.\n",
      "There are four people starring in the film, father, mother, son, daughter, they live in the bottom society, son, as a person, he has seven emotions and six desires, the father represents selfishness, greed and violence, the mother represents hard-working and pragmatic duty, the younger sister represents happiness, happy and chic, in order to achieve the goal, he first sacrificed happiness, hidden selfishness, with pragmatism. As a result......\n",
      "Spoiler alert. the moral is pathetic. There is no need to explain such a story. there's no point killing a lot of people almost for pleasure.\n",
      "Never expected a movie from a foreign language would make me like so much as i liked this movie...the story is realy good too\n",
      "Had I watched this movie before squid games, i would have most likely rated it a 10/10. Unfortunately I watched it after, and that takes away much of the novelty that went into squid games because there are so many parallels. Also, personally, a bit sickened from this style of drama. Artistically, however, it is a an excellent movie, with great performances which, coupled with great directing, it feels you are watching a theatrical performance from fist row seat!\n",
      "This movie just had it all : comedy , drama , tense . All very well stuck together . Definitely worth the watch !\n",
      "Beautifully written screen play. loved the camera work. Always appreciated the performance of Kang-ho Song.\n",
      "It's a more hopeful and ironic Shoplifters. Dope Movie.\n",
      "The first half of the movie is very good and then the movies takes a Cohe Brothersesque turn to the absurd. As with the Cohns Adaptation and some others (and I'm a major fan of the CB), when the writers ran into the brick wall not knowing where the story should go, they turned to the absurd and contrived the rest to the intelligent consumers utter disappointment. This movie will not last the test of time and its user rating will fade lower in time. Worth the watch just to learn how to finish a screenplay thats amazing but has yet for formulate a working ending... Just contrive the absurd and youll win an academy award.\n",
      "First time in the history, a foreign movie got oscar and that is parasite 2019. There are some extraordinary characteristics which make this movie a unique one.\n",
      "One of the these exclusive traits is high ambition and downfall. Bong Joon Ho uses a middle class family and their sky high ambition in the movie in a very subtle way which must mesmerize a viewer.If you want see the struggle of middle class and their cravings for money , the Parasite 2019 is for you.\n",
      "I would have to say this is one of the best movies I have watched. Not only is the cinematography on point, but the storyline and the messages embedded into the film was apparent and very fun to dissect.\n",
      "Original.If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Bong Joon Ho and everyone else put in to make this happen.I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.Thank you.\n",
      "Best movie i've ever seen. Amazing cast, little bit of comedy, the ending was WOW. Everything about this movie is great.\n",
      "This movie is pretty good,\n",
      "The score and cinematography combine to create a lucid sense of reality bringing a more artsy nature that is just jaw dropping,\n",
      "It's genuinely beautifully shot. The camera angles combined with how the focus shifts depending on the characters' feeling or emotion is something to marvel.\n",
      "Also manages to transform a fairly bland aesthetic to a dream-like image through the lighting and focus, making bland canvases into something they aren't, an idea through the movie.\n",
      "The way Kang-Ho Song and Bong Joon Ho create emotion through the facial expressions, twitched and little reactions is superb.\n",
      "I do feel the final act was slightly forced as he almost feels it needs to happen, but this is negligible compared to the rest of the movie.\n",
      "Probably the most invested and immersed I've been in a movie for a while.\n",
      "It also creates tension and suspense up there with some of the best ever. It also creates an uneasy nature the whole way through, keeping you in the edge of your seat the whole time.\n",
      "The humor ranges from really dark to almost slapstick which perfectly exemplifies the characters development through the movie, giving a greater understanding of the characters\n",
      "This movie gets a reward Oscar winning Korean films. In our society, there is a class difference between the affluent and the poor, which is reflected in this film. The main character are Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun.Storyline of Parasite movie, there was a poor family that wanted to make enough money by working in the homes of wealthy people by as a teacher, a servant, or a driver but found another family lurking in the basement of a rich family's home.In the movie first, A poor family have 4 persons, that lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment. One day the son wants to work, and he has a friend for help him to get a job. Therefore, he gets the job teach the child of a wealthy family. After that he see the chance for take him family to work together. So, he convinces his sister and his parents to join him as teacher, driver, and a servant in an affluent family. In the middle of movie poor family found another family lurking in the basement and then they are killing each other. At the last point his father lurking in the basement and him buy a home from wealthy family.In my opinion, I think a movie plot so surprising because in first we can't know about flashing light in the house, but we know in the end of the story, flashing light is a morse code that use for communicating with other. In the part of actor's show is so professional and that great when putting emotion in front of the camera. In the composition of movie, I think that can reflect a class difference between the affluent and the poor people good. In a part of music in movie give a feeling of sobriety and thriller with movie. In my personal suggestion, if you unlike a blood you should be careful because in this movie have a tragedy.My personal film ratingOverall score (9/10)Story line (8/10Character (9/10)Movie soundtrack (9/10)\n",
      "Poverty and prosperity, hope and despair, this is a story that profoundly reflects the bottom of society, ridiculous but realistic, struggling in despair, looking for beauty in hope, a liar family gang mixed into the upper class, each making a living, step by step shocking. Borrowed space, deceived wine, a moment of happiness, the most beautiful is not the villa courtyard but the family, the rich surface is glamorous and beautiful, behind the drug abuse, the children are rebellious and sick, the poor put down patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face, just like this Going into the room becomes falling to the bottom. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complicated, human nature is difficult to ponder, and I hope that fantasy will become a reality ~ The Palme d'Or is deserved!\n",
      "I don't know why this much of hype created for this movie. I have seen many movies with much great story, screenplay and neutrality. This one too is same as simple as an average movie. It's very boring and I thought it will blown away my mind with great script. But failed to impress me.\n",
      "This movie leads us to review the real life between High class and the worst-est level. It is sad to feel actual feeling, but it is real! please spend a little time to watch. It is so worthy!\n",
      "Bomb Movie! Should watch at least once. Very metaphorical and tragic. Solid 8 in my opinion.\n",
      "What a story... It's really hard to say anything without spoiling it but it is so worth seeing. Lots of of genres in one film. Amazing acting, a little gullible but within common sense/It definitely makes you think even though it feels like an interesting adventure with a little bit of a comedy but that's just a start... hold on to whatever your sitting on...It's gonna be one of a kind ride...\n",
      "Funny, absorbing, dark,and an original screenplay I loved this film. At just over two hours in length it never felt that long at all, and the subtitles the film obviously carries being a Korean production have never bothered me as much as dubbing has done for me in the past as they just do not capture the movie the way it should !! hearing the original language is far better in my opinion.The direction and the cast were superb and as for the beautiful house its mainly filmed in is just so perfect I want to live there now. The film deserves the accolades it rightly as been getting,and Is a worthy best picture Oscar winner for me.\n",
      "I thought was it was one of the best films for 2019. Story was a little confusing. It involves two families: one poor, one rich. The poor family does everything they can to ingratiate themselves into the rich family's lives. They get caught up in a web of lies, starting their own lies with their employment with the family.The movie's plot was a little misleading. You thought it was going to start off as a family comedy heist. Later on the movie starts to take a darker, more sinister turn.Overall, movie was spectacular. The acting was phenomenal. The cinematography was breathtaking.Wouldn't give the movie all 10 stars because of the plot but, would definitely recommend to Korean film fans.\n",
      "Great piece of cinema but needed less Korean. Was happy with that end scene where everyone got slaughtered because it meant they stopped speaking Korean.\n",
      "I wanted to watch this thing after all the raving reviews, and now I'm angry, because I hated this movie. I couldn't stand the main cast, the rich family was actually quite pleasant, I wanted to know more about them, they seemed like nice people.Boring, long, and it wasn't nearly as funny as everybody says. While it did had some nice shots, mainly during the flooding scenes, the rest is the same locations over and over. I don't even remember if it had music.A lot of stuff hapenning was way too far fetched. Apparently this family of people who can't fold a pizza box becomes a team of master scammers in a week, and then proceed to make the most absurd decisions ever nonstop, fueled by greed and resentment.The reason behind Kim's final crime still eludes me. I know it has to do with the whole \"crossing the line\" and \"odor\" thing, but come on... that's his breaking point? It's not even like Park Hoon said it to his face, he actually kept it for himself when he could've just fired him at the spot.I simply never felt like he was actually a bad guy, he looked like an honest, hard working, family man. I simply couldn't see the \"discrimination\" from him, when he actually hires everyone without even checking their backgrounds, and is willing to pay them handsomely. It's not even like he exploits them or anything.Many lines seemed to be there for no reason. At the end, Kim expresses remorse for his crime, yet we never see him redeem himself, nor repent in any other form, like turning himself in. Then why leave the line there? Same thing happened when the mother of the kid tells the story of the ghost. At this point we know is the guy living in the basement, so what's the point of the story now? Wouldn't be better to tell it before that revelation, so it comes as a bigger surprise? What was the whole point of the Morse code from the husband, if the kid never tells anything? I get that it helps with the resolution, but Kim could've gotten to that idea by himself.I think it's beyond overrated, it has way too many holes, it's boring, and the message is just not that deep. I'm so tired of the whole \"rich people are evil because they have money and therefore do evil things\" stuff. Just take your Oscars and get away from my face.\n",
      "This is where the class dystopia begins, we see a story that looks as if it is false or to good to be true but it is! This movie seems to take on so many things and balance them all with perfection and grace. hats off to Boon Joon Ho for is fantastic wrtting and revolutionary direction.\n",
      "Don't open the door to people in the middle of the night. Don't roll down the stairs unsteadily. Don't show too much to dislike certain tastes. Every little accident leads to the final necessity.\n",
      "You really can't ask for more from a movie. Bong Joon Ho tackles inequality with a wonderfully strange concept that unfurls like an onion, becoming stranger and more duplicitous as you reach the core of his ideas--never polemical--not that this reviewer is troubled by polemics--Parasite maintains tension with his usual spiking of lacerating humor. The weird core, the subbasement of the film, reveals itself with creeping vigor. Love.\n",
      "Perfect in everything it does, except in focusing on what divides humans rather than what unites us\n",
      "This movie's all of scene move on step by step. It's like a crime noval; always a twist appear and general flow is so fluent, you always be cruise about next step. Out of this; Film tells it's story with a rally striking way. Such that sometimes I was thrilled to death. Even it's sometimes move away from the reality, it's can keep on the main idea. End of the day those factors reveal a realy good movie.\n",
      "Parasite is special in that it is able to achieve what other movies about metaphors can't, it's entertaining and highly enthralling. The movie doesn't have a dull moment. If you struggle to buy into the metaphor about meritocracy, you will still be highly entertained by a dark and very often sinister movie.\n",
      "This is an outstanding film with lots of fascinating subtlety. The cinematography is not only gorgeous but also conveys more about the characters. It has a great musical score that emphasizes the underlying themes and deftly ramps up a creeping sense of dread. The film seems less interested in making a socio-economic statement than it is with crafting a tight thriller that captures audience attention from start to finish.\n",
      "What new in content...\n",
      "Waste of 2hrs by watching this movie\n",
      "Simply overhyped the movie\n",
      "Filled with amazing characters, beautiful cinematography, frightening moments, dark humor, and a timeless social message, Parasite succeeds on all counts.\n",
      "Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.Strong 4.5/5\n",

      "As in all recent works, Pon Joon-ho is not shy about frontal metaphoricity and is not afraid of unambiguous interpretations. Moreover, he openly mocks himself, declares in the voice of one of the heroes: they say, yes, you are right, \"this is all a metaphor.\" The director is not interested in hidden meanings and complex allegories - his code lies on the surface, and it is much more curious not what his movie is about (to understand this, it is enough to read the synopsis), but how far Pon Joon-ho will lead his leapfrog with style and images. If at the beginning it is obvious to us who is hiding under those \"parasites\", then by the end the title of the film takes on global and comprehensive meanings: parasites-poor, parasites-rich, parasites in the kitchen, attic and basement, inside and outside, on both sides of the screen. It's all a metaphor, yes, but no one warned how broad it is.\n",
      "The movie Parasite lifts up to its name as the plot revolves around the Kim family-- a family who lives in a small semi-basement in Korea using different tactics to leech off the Park family-- a well-off family who live in a mansion. The plot of Parasite was attractive, but what I found more appealing are the conflicts created by the gap between the rich and poor.The structure of classism was displayed in the movie in scenes where the audience could see vast physical differences between the Park and Kim family-- the semi-basement that the Kim family live in is shabby, wet, and has little light, and the mansion on the hill is sleek, modern, and filled with light. What the Park possess is out of reach for the Kims, but it is also what they dream of eventually having themselves. Despite living a life of privilege, the Parks show no sympathy for the poor. They choose not to see or do anything about the wide divide in classes around them as society allows them to exist in oblivion. There is no blame put upon the upper class for not understanding the hardships of the poor. This oblivion can be seen in the movie after the huge rain storm. The next day, Mrs, Park expresses her satisfaction of the rain bringing blue skies for her son's birthday party. She fails to think about all of the people, such as the Kims, who have lost all of their possessions during the storm. She even has the audacity to make a comment about the smell coming from Mr. Kim as he helps her shop for the party.It is also striking that although the Kim family is poor and dislikes the upper class, they do little to move out of the position that they are in. The Kim family possesses different forms of capital from the beginning, yet they are unwilling to develop the skill sets that they have and move upwards in a way that does not involve lying and deceit. Mrs. Kim is a past champion in hammer throwing, and both the son and daughter are intelligent and resourceful people who have the ability to succeed in school and get stable jobs. Besides, the son and daughter of the Kim family are already on track in terms of collecting more capitals by attending college to be educated and accumulate knowledge. Instead, they deceive the Parks into hiring their whole family, ultimately ending in deaths and pain for both families.There are many metaphors that exist within the movie that illustrate the difference in class and the potential conflicts that exist. The tall stairs between the street levels that the Kim family goes down after sneaking into the Park's house to have a party show the massive gap between the rich and the poor. The places where different families live mark their social status-the Park who belongs to upper-class live on top of a hill; the Kim who is in lower-class live in a semi-basement, and the old housekeeper family who is poorer than the Kim live in an actual basement. In addition, the stone that the Kim family totes around from the beginning of the movie signifies their desire to enter the upper class. However, the placing of the stone back into the river shows lessons learned and the fact that some of the Kim family is finally able to achieve a life of wealth by the end of the movie, but only through hard work and dedication.This movie shows the inevitable conflict in the social structure created by the ignorance of the vast wealth gap, as well as the different social ideologies and forms among different groups of people.\n",
      "This movie was immensely fun to watch! My wife and I heard a lot of buzz around this so we decided to give it a watch for ourselves. Acting was a 10/10 with a unique story that was executed 10/10 with fantastic cinematography and directing 10/10. I can't say enough about this movie, it's a MUST WATCH. On a side note going into the movie me and the wife watched the trailer but didn't get much out of it, GOOD! The less you know going into this, the more you will enjoy it!\n",
      "Apart from Hollywood I like seeing International movies, Iranian, Korean, French, German etc. moviesParasite movie came into news because it won Oscar for best movie. It is the first foreign movie to win the top most prize. With that came the comparison and allegation that it is a remake of a Tamil movie - Minsara Kanna.May be the plot of the movie is taken from Minsara Kanna, but the story is totally different. In Tamil movie which is a comedy - the story is about winning the family of a rich girl whom the poor hero loves, and he brings each member of his family to do a job (similar to Parasite movie) in the girl's family, and there is a happy ending.Whereas in the South Korean movie Parasite is about class divide, the poor family slowly plots to be part of rich family and in the end there is gory violence where the poor family kills off the rich family.I have seen the Tamil movie and I was interested to see the South Korean movie with all the buzz and good reviews it garnered.The Director Bong Joon Ho - has built the sets of houses for both the poor family living down town dirty and dingy basement and rich family living uptown spacious luxurious bungalow.The poor family are shown cunning, smart, clever and shrewd and the rich family people are shown stupid, dumb and ignorant. As the movie progresses - each member of poor family finds a way in the rich family household by forging documents, and sweet talks.The internet is so full with stuff on how the director has taken pain in comparatively portraying small details of poor and rich life styles on the celluloid.The Director also insists on watching the movie without subtitles.Some audiences who may be jealous of rich people - laughed at the way rich people are fooled by poor people. (sour grapes - Inequity and income gap disparity syndrome) But the movie could not drawn a little bit of smirk on my face.\n",
      "Critics who have lauded this movie say it is rise of socialism against crony corrupt capitalism.The Director Bong has made a stupid movie marketing it as an intelligent thriller, and those who are liking it - makes us doubt today world's sanity. People who rave about this movie must be mentally \"sick\" people.They are the real parasites of this world - and not the rich or poor which the director intends to show here.The acting is not good. Th plot and twists are so convenient and predictably dumb. Forcibly inserted vulgarity and terrible violence at the end just to juxtapose the lethargy of a third rate scripting and film-making.The Tamil movie was bad, but the South Korean movie is worse.Anyways - the Director Bong Joon Ho - is smiling on grabbing 241 awards internationally and 4 Oscars. The times we live in...!I go with 3 out of 10 rating.\n",
      "The best movie ever! Unexpected twist. Great actors. Great storyline. Amazing movie!\n",
      "This movie is everything....i wish i could give more than 10\n",
      "Now whe are here again, Korea. What can I say? Great movie, absurdum, criminal and black comedy, fits so perfect into this movie. Great actors, curiosity about what happens next, much excitement! 🇰🇷\n",
      "You forget it's not in English after the first few minutes; that's how gripping it is. What a wild story and innovative idea. The movie screams our society's obsession/dependence with money and WiFi. Social commentary aside, still quite amazing.\n",
      "This movie is just different from other movies that I have watched & it's reality based too.\n",
      "Its just awesome how they unfold the mysteries and I'll surely say that you'll not get bored watching this movie.It has a mixture of different feelings and the musics that were choosen is just perfectly matched.Besides the actors also done great job in acting.To be honest,the ending was kinda unexpected and surprising to me but in conclusion i have to say that it has done a perfect ending though.\n",
      "Overall its a great movie too watch for everyone because it I'll give you thrill,romance,crime, mystery, comedy and even horror vibes too.\n",
      "It reflects the differences and opposition of the rich and the poor, and exposes the despair and helplessness of the underlying society.I think it does a good job of deconstructing the metaphors and themes of the story with attractive visual and audio premises. The theme of the movie is very good, and the shooting is also very clever.\n",
      "Man this movie was really good, maybe not mind blowing nor does it have alot of spectacle, but it tells it's story with so much care, thrill and precision that it doesn't need big spectacle.In a lot of ways this movie reminded me of Better Call Saul's early seasons, with the elaborate schemes that unravel while the viewer watches. The start of the movie has a very positive tone along with it.Speaking of tone that's probably what the movie does best, taking the light hearted cheerful tone and slowly over the course of the two hours slowly getting darker until the ending. Although the last minutes of runtime after the big ending scene I didn't care for too much myself, felt like it brought it back up from the grim ending back to the starts tone a tad too quickly to me.\n",
      "There was nothing in this movie, bad story, bad acting.. and the worst ending... stupid movie...\n",
      "To be short,this is a greatly directed,perfectly shot masterpiece with well-crafted characters that strike a balance between nastiness and sympathetic,and can be interpreted both ways;pitch dark humor that is both ironic and clever and fits the main theme,which perfectly blends horror with a satirical tone.\n",
      "Parasite is so good. The energy of this film is unique with the blend of different styles being both seamless and quirky. I loved the creative choices made here from the direction, to the cinematography, to the production design and the script. It's fresh and so unlike anything we've seen in recent memory.The way the film builds to that climax is truly masterful. Bravo!\n",
      "What an incredible film. I'm not even going to talk much about it in detail because I just want to encourage others to watch it. It shouldn't be detailed, just watched. It was perfect from top to bottom. It gets everything it wants to accomplish right, and does it in such an in your face yet subtle way. The class struggle, the strong bond of family, happiness, love, teenage angst, motherhood, pain, loss, just all of it. One of the best films of this generation, and I don't think I give away that kind of praise easily.\n",
      "This movie is over rated. It's a very regular foreign movie with no creativity at all in the story or the image.\n",
      "8.5/10 is my rating. This is South ean thriller thriller drama that runs 132 minutes.Two worlds collide when members of a poor family struggling to make end meet go to work for the wealthy Park family. In the same genre of dark twisted tales as \"Basic Instinct\", \"Gone Girl\", \"Pacific Heights\", \"Momento\" and \"The Game.\"Kim Ki-taek, Mr Kim; (Song Kang-ho)\n",

Ki-woo's friend approached him as he was leaving to study abroad and wanted him to fill in his tutoring job and keep other boys away from the girl he is tutoring and likes (he is waiting for her to get older). While Ki-woo does not have credentials he has studied for and taken entrance exams enough that he has gained expertise. He is the first member of the Kim family to be employed by the Parks.\n",

      "Da-Hye's tutor.\n",
      "This was a very dark story in that the wealthy family was conned into giving the entire Kim family positions which they were not qualified for. Through careful manipulation and deceit they were able to eliminate existing staff and obtain high paying jobs with the Parks. At one point the Kim's collected information on all relevant personal and financial details leading to the conclusion rather had something even darker in mind. Things took some very unexpected twists at the end. I liked this movie and it reminded me of some very dark American dramas I have seen over the years. i felt like the change from one up man ship to murder happened more quickly than the situation warranted and felt it would have added suspense if things had built to that point a bit more slowly. It is a very good movie in this genre and I understand why it gained recognition.\n",
      "Its a great movie. It has a dark humor vibe than takes a sarl turn and becomes a horror/thriller movie and I love it.\n",
      "The twists and turns to the last minute! An accurate depiction of people's characters with all the good and evil and the sense of survival. I was absolutely taken by surprise and my stomach got turned toward the end, but all part of a very realistic storyline. Definitely worth watching. I will do so again once the effect of the first time-round has subsided. Brilliant work.\n",
      "After the film getting an Oscar and recommendations from from friends I went to see this movie with high expectations. I enjoyed it, laughed quite a bit at the carnage, but could see what was going to happen from a mile off. Only surprise was much more mundane than what I expected. Interesting and insightful about Korean culture and disparities in living conditions, and the hopes and aspirations of all but felt something was missing. I read that Bong Joon-ho relied on intensive story boarding and this film did feel like enacted somewhat in segments. I thought the first half was slow and somewhat predictable, second half livelier and more enjoyable. Did not think it worthy of an Oscar.\n",
      "I won't be forgetting this movie anytime soon.... It blew my mind..\n",
      "Bong Joon-Ho's epic thriller opened me up to South Korea's expanding film culture.With clever dialogue, detailed set design and edge of your seat moments like I've never seen before, Parasite very much deserved its 4 Oscars it received, including Best Picture.\n",
      "One of the most powerful things about this film is that at first sight, it seems that the evil of the poor is naked, while the rich family is a little innocent. But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family. The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society.\n",
      "If you love gratuitous violence, this for you. Unbelievable this got those Oscars. Truly disgusting, I was ready to walk out numerous times, and am angry with myself for not having done so.UGH!\n",
      "The story looks very simple but it takes you from top level to bottom level in just a minute,so you can have very different feelings at the same time like a real life. WATCH AND SEE !!!\n",
      "Amazing movie i loved it so much i think this movie is revealing for us the other side of movies we don't care about because it is just did not made in Hollywood it is legendary and i think i will remember every detail of it even if i saw one time because simply it is special. Great job.\n",
      "Definately everyone should watch this movie once in life. a great cinematic narration with great storyline .\n",
      "Though it won the oscar award the movie doesn't impressed me a lot .....may be because I'm not into Korean dramas yet.The best thing about it is its originality and its theme about societal structure. So, its worth watching.\n",
      "When I saw \"parasite\" it had already hit hard in cannes, and now it sweeps the Oscars. The premise is about a very low-income family that is getting involved with another family but of high class bringing unpredictable events. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the metaphor in the title goes a long way and makes us think of ourselves as a society and who the \"parasite\" really is in this film. There are no good or bad for both the poor and the rich family. As for the performances, they are excellent taking the rhythm of the film and going from humor (often black humor) to very dramatic and intense situations, especially reaching the third act. The direction, the staging, the lighting and the staging are outstanding, as is the music, making a great choreography. This type of film was needed, making an x-ray of the most complex beings in this world and how we handle ourselves ... Humans.\n",
      "Masterpiece movie. Shocking and thrilling but still very funny. Best to go in knowing nothing, the pacing and editing is perfect. Most well deserved Oscar in a LONG time.\n",
      "The mastery of time and space is ingenious. It reflects the opposition between the rich and the poor,exposing the frustration of the bottom society.\n",
      "I found this film to be an okay film but I don't think it's as good as it's high rating suggests but each to their own and obviously a lot of watchers wouldn't agree with me.\n",
      "I have seen many movies in 2019,but i have to admit,this is by far the most mysterious& beautifully depicted movie of 2019.I found this movie to be equally exciting and edge of the seat kind of movie.I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot.In the second half it was lagging a little bit,but the climax shook me up.Family melodrama, comedy, social commentary ,it has everything.\n",
      "I was confused of who, exactly, is the parasite: the poverty-stricken family who are living off the rich, or the rich one that reaps the benefits of their hard work.It is a story of the poor, basement-dwelling Kim family,who are living off the rich park family . The park are total opposites.They live in a grand, modernist mansion in a hilly Seoul suburb; The scam takes shape when the Kims' bright young son chances upon a job as a language tutor for the Parks' teenage daughter. He recommends his sister as an 'art therapist' for their son,and says she's a distant, renowned acquaintance, and soon his parents start working as the family driver and housemaid, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the little kid points out that they all smell alike - and they smell of poor people.This really is a horribly fascinating film, brilliantly written.\n",
      "Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that congeals into hostility.The first half was going on smoothly and building tension about what is going to happen next.The last half unraveled the dark truth of the family.The discovery by the kim family of another family already living at the basement of the park family and their trying to lead the day with luxury, when park family went for a outing.The horrifying behavior of the kim family with the basement dewellers,and at last the murders of the park family in the hands of the kim.It was a heart wrenching and edge of the seat kind movie.I believe anyone who loves thrillers and mystery and yes,some surprises,they would surely love the movie.The filmmaker Bong Joon Ho really knows exactly what he's doing and why he's doing it. It is a remarkably well-edited film.The name is perfect for the movie.The kim family is the parasite,who are like leeches sucking blood off the park family.Technically there are no villains in here.But the kim family are so gory and ferocious.Where as the rich park family can also be termed as parasites as they are dependent on these untrustworthy people for every sort of job.So the villain here is the situation,the capitalist society.A society where there is a huge gap between the income of the rich and the poor.the poor becomes poorer and the rich gets richer.Whatever the kim family did, they did out of outrage,the ignorance of the park;s about the poor kim's.The kim's just wanted to change their fate of poverty.Overall this movie is one of a kind movie of the year 2019.I thoroughly enjoyed the film.\n",
      "Full of surprises, quirky and entertaining. Definitely recommend this film!\n",
      "It starts off interesting, but you have no idea where it's going. You end up having moments that make you smile from ear to ear, to moments of pure anxiety and borderline horror. The way it carries from scene to scene is seamless. My girlfriend described it as \"a wild ride\", which sums it up very well. Fully deserved all of its awards and acclaim. Highly recommend\n",
      "A truly remarkable film with as many layers as there is great characters. The climax is shocking, especially when Kim Ki-Jung is dying but Mr. Park is yelling at her father to get the car and take his son (who seems to be having a panic attack... likely because what has happened is shocking and he actually cares about the lives of others) to the hospital. His continued screaming made his killing inevitable.I wish the film ended with Kim Ki-Woo purchasing the home and sharing a moment with his father.\n",
      "Top 10 movie of all time. The movie is hilarious and tense. There are no short cuts in life. Actions have consequences. And, family is really all one has in the end.\n",
      "One of the few movies I've seen where you really have no idea what's going to happen next. I don't know and I don't really care about any of the films deeper political messages, but purely from an entertainment standpoint it is a great film. Once you think you have it figured out, it throws you a curveball and goes down a completely different road.\n",
      "I watched Parasite on Prime Video, expecting it to be an above average film. It really was not.The initial build up was too slow, the story thereafter was interesting but certainly not great cinema. It was just okay. The violence towards the end was too gory.Overall, I found Parasite over rated.\n",
      "The first half of this film sets up the mind blowing second half perfectly. I usually can predict what type of twist or at least have a couple different general directions of where a plot twist might be headed; trust me on this, you'll never see it coming. My favorite films of all time include No Country for Old Men and The Departed; this is right up there with them and in some ways eclipses the rest. A must see.\n",
      "I hadn't seen this since it was released and I am amazed how I didn't remember the ending correctly and that \"the plan\" hadn't quite worked out. It's a film about a lot of things, but a simplistic description is that it's about a family of poverty one by one overtaking the lives and home of a family of wealth, hence the title. It's a film about class structure, greed, selfishness, criminality, liars, the spoiled, love, envy and more. It's part comedy, drama, sci-fi, thriller, horror and as implausible as hell, but the ride is great fun. It's brilliantly constructed by Bong Joon Ho with a flawless cast. It's beautifully shot and it is historic due to it being the first foreign language film to win a best picture Oscar. This is a highly original and wonderful film, but I'm not so sure that Oscar didn't belong to 1917, another brilliant piece of filmmaking.\n",
      "This film is awesome, the story carries dozens of surprises and keeps you wanting more,, just a little bit more. The setting is just right, the criminal mind is set into motion in unexpected ways. Loved it.\n",
      "Good story good acting\n",
      "Another masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho\n",
      "Absolutely deserve the Oscar\n",
      "The haters of this movie are the lovers of the garbage movie 🤢 (moonlight)\n",
      "The first half of this movie is soooooo slowww. Takes forever for the exposition. Easily a half hour could have been edited out.Then, with no forewarning, the guy in the basement turns out to be nuts. The slasher scene that follows is unexpected, unnecessary, and ridiculous. Way too gory.This film is obviously the flavor of the month, but the plot holes don't hold up.\n",
      "This movie tell us a story about a class struggle in South Korea. I like the plot twist.\n",
      "This movie shows all the aspects of life.\n",
      "Truth\n",
      "Lie\n",
      "Honesty\n",
      "Karma\n",
      "And destiny\n",
      "Its a crux of life.\n",
      "What a master piece\n",
      "I absolutely loved this! The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed. The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened. This was beautiful acted and so well done, I haven't seen a movie as good as this was in a long time. I have no points of improvement, everything was so well thought. This was a movie which took a while to get out of my head, cause everything was so intense. I would really recommend this to anyone!!\n",
      "Korean movies usually don't hit me this hard, but this movie does. It's an excellent movie. It's a really good story about a poor family trying to infiltrate a house where the owners are clearly more than rich. The name of this movie matches the poor family very well, because it seems obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family.\n",
      "Slow moving at the beginning, but it picked up quickly to a gut-wrenching climax at the end. Comedy of errors, serious social commentary, human emotions and a horrifying climax. All the ingredients of a prize winning film.\n",
      "I liked the house and the cinematography. Struggled to watch it. Didn't really warm to any of the characters. Laughed twice. Plot was predictable but not a crime in itself. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "This movie is amazing, I love it, the best movie I have watched this year!\n",
      "Decades have passed since we had such a masterpiece\n",
      "I would have given the movie 10 stars but they ending of the movie is not completed properly they left it in the middle\n",
      "Parasite is a phenomenal film with top notch acting and fantastic direction from Bong Joon-ho, known for the films Snowpiercer and The Host, this movie may be his masterpiece. It contains eccentric and interesting characters, as well as a bizzare plot line that should keep any audience thouroghly entertained throughout. I went in knowing nothing, and this is the best way to watch this movie. The less you know about the plot, the better. It won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and rightfully so, I'd say. The direction is flawless, many characters and subplots weave together to create a beautiful mess of a movie. I love this film, and anyone who loves movies will love it as well. The reason it doesn't recieve a 10 is due to its disjointedness, which seems intentional, though I would have preferred it to be more focused and feel less rushed. This film may have worked better if it was about 30 minutes longer. Anyway, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you haven't already, its sitting on Hulu right now.\n",
      "I've been thinking, how do you avoid tragedy? It's better if they don't open the door, or go to the police, than if they do. Because to avoid the real owner of the house to get things must be \"shady\".But then again, maybe it was in the moment of alcohol-induced happiness that I really thought I was rich and had a kind heart that shouldn't belong to me.\n",
      "It appears this years theme is social injustice between lower and higher classes (Joker, this crap) . I was okay with this movie up until 3/4 . Now i have regret that I've wasted 2 hours of my life 13 dollars . And to think it won over Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I knew Oscars suck but this really is a final nail in the coffin.\n",
      "I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.\n",
      "Never expected, from the cast to director.\n",
      "I forced my friends to watch and everybody agreed with me.\n",
      "This one is a masterpiece. It will make you laugh sometimes, it will chill you sometimes, and it will make you cry sometimes. This movie will be with to the end\n",
      "Very good story\n",
      "Excellent actors\n",
      "Fantastic direction\n",
      "A complete movie from all points of view\n",
      "Although I'm not a fan of South Korean films, this film is different from the rest\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho is one of the best and talented Director. Parasite was a great dark comedy movie. It was pretty much realistic movie. I'm not that great to write a review about this movie. Everybody should watch this movie.\n",
      "The narrative of this film is so unique.The first act may seem slow, but then the narrative develops in a very original and believable way, the script does not just develop a few things, everything has a convincing explanation. The film deals with issues of contempt for different social classes, and since the upper social class is not at all interested in the problems of others, they only live in their bubble while the world falls apart, this is portrayed in a crude and realistic way, by showing different representations of this. The character development is extensive, the acting is good, the editing is good, and the third act is very shocking and unexpected.It deserves all the awards it won, it is a very good film that is worthwhile and has a lot of quality, with a well-executed original concept it manages to captivate the public's attention all the time.\n",
      "Parasite. This movie has to be in everyones top ten if they've seen it. I seriously can't comprehend how someone would dislike this movie. This movie starts with a poor south korean family having to battle with terrible internet, poor income, and people urinating on their property. The name of this movie certainly fits, a Parasite. The fake rich with the rich stealing their goods from them, and eventually taking their lives as a whole. Not only was this movie social commentary on the living conditions and lack of income South Koreans frequently suffer from, but if you didn't make that connection and pushed that part aside this is the most tense ive ever been watching a movie. And my other favorite movies are Whiplash and The Departed so thats really saying something. The director of this movie was incredible, and this movie truly deserves to be in the top ten. I place it on my list around the same placement as Pulp Fiction, which is #8 on the highest rated movies of all time. This movie is engaging as heck, and sometimes you forget you're even watching a movie and instead getting a scope of an insanely talented and intelligent families life. In the scene where they all practice their lines for the next day of work, I truly pictured myself and my family doing this. I never really grew up poor, Low income at birth but not to the extent of this family, and I still found myself relating to this. When you look at the rich people's houses and get used to our protagonists operating inside of it, you look around at your house and begin to feel like you're the family living in the semi basement. You begin to relate to the characters and say they're doing what they can to get by. I mean what's different from them and modern society, chasing that bigger paycheck, that better house, and a more comfortable life style. I mean who hasn't wished for that? Around 1 hour in, there's a plot twist that changes the rest of the movie somewhat drastically, but I promise my heart rate hit at least 180BPM while watching those scenes. Parasite is on hulu, go watch it now if you can.\n",
      "Possibly the best movie I've ever seen, yes I have a few sad thoughts about quarantine and I needed something to spark some interest, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those movies that's almost impossible to classify, it doesn't fit into any particular genre, but covers almost all of them.Great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I liked the last stages as much as the first part of the movie, I know some didn't. It just takes you to a completely different place.You will laugh and cry, you will lose yourself in a miracle. Do yourself a favor and order it, 10/10.\n",
      "This movie give us a full satisfaction after watch, leaves us no question because everything happens have an answer inside the film.Its been a long long time since i watch a movie like this, every moments make sense.\n",
      "Basking in the sunlight of a courtyard can evolve into a man, breathing in the air of a dark room will only walk flesh like a ghost. Hold the poor stone can not get rid of for life, catch the cheap smell can not be eliminated forever. Bedbugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening Windows with potions; The host at the top pays people to disinfect it. Rich people suck the blood of poor people to rise, poor people sent to live in the rich people's houses, the ghost in the same room to share food, parasitic worm and beast development enmity.\n",
      "The rich man did nothing wrong, even to the servants, but he could not help hating them, hating them!\n",
      "To be honest, the family 's three views and one word are difficult to solve. It 's really a problem. Like a parasite, the family sucks in others. Don't say it 's disgusting, even if it 's low. If something goes wrong, you still want to solve the problem by killing people. In the end, your father killed the little girl 's dad. At the end, he was still completely regretful. He did n't lose the little girl. Then this layer of class gaps and gaps that are determined by social status and money need not be portrayed. Such an explicit irony is only ironic. Such a direct description not only does not perfectly show the poverty at the bottom of this society. The destiny of the gap between cheap and social class seems to add to the picture, but it is indeed a masterpiece of the feature film.\n",
      "Wonderfully described the parasitic nature of human. The story of hardworking family struggling to meet ends of daily needs, start thriving off a host. Great comeback in end.\n",
      "PARASITE (2019) **** Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choie, So-dam Park, Jeong-eun Lee, Hye-jin Jan, Myeong-hoon Park, Ji-so Jung, Hyun-jun Jung. Superb South Korean film from brilliant filmmaker Bong Joon Ho who weaves a tight wire thin fable of family, class distinction and diabolical cunning in this black comic/horror drama about the near destitute Kim family who deceive an upper-class family, The Parks, by infiltrating themselves into their domestic bliss posing as highly-skilled caregivers that ultimately leads to a plot of Greek tragedy proportions. Well acted by one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled and a Hitchcockian bar set for suspense and eventual dread. One of the best films of the decade which would go on to win 4 Oscars for Best Picture, Directing, Original Screenplay (co-written by Jin Won Han with Ho) and Best International Film.\n",
      "These are some films or musics got frame and publicities for no reason at all and actually good ones got no mention at all - this is A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF This. Much much better recent Korean Film would be Deranged, The Berlin File, Miracle in Cell Number 7 and etc.\n",
      "Watch it...its a classic and brilliantly done, I watched it 8 times after the first...\n",
      "This movie had me terrified the entire time which is incredibly rare. Easy 10. I've never experienced something like this.\n",
      "The surprise at the Oscars. So finally I got the time to see what's it all about and I must say. It's a simple story but it works out really fine. In fact, it's a story about home invasion but not in a horror way but in a normal way, lower-class invades upper-class.Even as it is spoken in a language that needs subtitles I had a smile on my face in some situations. But it's also weird what is happening in the basement. I had a bit of problems what is happening in the basement with the lights, it's funny but also a thing you can't believe.But I agree, I understand for a flick coming out of a country not known for flicks that this is Oscar worthy. Excellent cinematography and top notch performances.Gore 0/5\n",

      "Bong Joon Ho's one of the best masterpiece of portraying social class division with twisting plots are nothing but incredible.The concept of the movie starts with showing the difference between upper class and lower class people lifestyle and their dependency. It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here.The first half of the film follows the family living at a semi basement apartment in poor locality. After the son is given an opportunity by his friend to teach as a English Tutor in rich family and came to realise that although he is earning more , his family is getting what they deserve. As they are not as bright as the son , so son decides to make a plan to employ their family in that house where he teaches. Sooner they become wealthy as they all working in different positions in the same house.\n",
      "The first half may look flat and give some impression of the base of movie .\n",
      "But when it comes to the second half there is a major plot twisting. It clears the display of showing the struggle of poor within the unjust society and hence this sudden joyful life comes into tragedy.\n",
      "This cast members brilliantly performed their role. The cinematography and background score of make the audience more focused!\n",
      "Its funny , thrilling, emotional and moral based script makes it a masterpiece !No doubt, it is one of my favourite movie and I am strongly recommend it to watch ( although it is an S.Korean movie ).\n",
      "Simply Amazing. I dont have anything else to tell you..\n",
      "I don't know how to describe it but i sure which you, you won't regret it.\n",
      "Movie is excellent till 1st half but in 2nd half you get bored irritating and may be scratch your hair\n",
      "The Movie was a totally masterpiece deserving oscar\n",
      "It should have got more Oscars if you ask me. What's not to like? This movie has everything. It's very rare to find a film like that. I think Americans have to start giving subtitles a second chance. Korean movies actually are doing great. I've been watching a lot of Asian films lately for a change I was surprised of how good some of them are. American movies are going down sooner or later.\n",
      "I was surprised that it was so much fun. The entertainment, the artistry, and the social grasp were also the best. It is an oversized home run of a giant stadium that the greatest genius of this era struck.\n",
      "I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality and the mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism. Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story. The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.\n",
      "A fabulous film but has some defects detracting the film from perfection...\n",
      "Slow burn, gripping, tension and feeling uneasy while watching. Best performance by Kim, his father Mr. Park and their family. And the other family mother is also. And everyone in this movie did their best in acting. This story can be dragged more and more. Than we could watch a better ending. I think, here the makers should have to do more research about the ending. Otherwise a solid screenplay and story.It's all about class difference or class inequality.\n",
      "It's all about greed.\n",
      "It's all about karma - Tit for tat.\n",
      "Parasite was my favorite film from 2019. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The conflict escalates to a boiling point at the end that left me in total shock. A true masterpiece.\n",
      "I might be the only one who didn't really like this movie. I went to the cinema to watch it with high expactations, and went out with disappointment. The movie is not bad, but also not good. I think it's overrated. Some things are not connected well and what in the high point of the movie happens doesn't satisfy me. In the cinema, I was literally like: ohh when will everything explose, the action should start soon. At the end of the movie, everything blows up, but it's not how you expected it. I cannot explain why I don't like it but something was not so right in the movie (not about the topic, about the course of events)\n",
      "I must say quite bizzare movie. Very twisted with the story and also with the end. I'm not sure it deserves for Oscar,not movie like that,anyway. It's quite a entertainer\n",
      "It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug.\n",
      "A movie with stakes, set ups and payoffs and an engaging plot.\n",
      "One of the best movies ever made. Period.Everything is just a masterpiece here: plot, directing, camera work, character development.A must watch DEEP movie.\n",
      "So, movie contains a good amount of metaphors.Color Scheme of movie creates a suspense and shot framing is perfect everytime. Clearly depicts a life of a poor family's life. Contains a good amount of humor and NSFW scenes present too.\n",
      "One of the best flim i have ever seen.Truly recommended to see the flim everyon.\n",
      "Couldn't predict anything that would happen!! So good. Even when you don't want to watch you can't take your eyes off the screen\n",
      "You might refrain yourself from watching it because it its in Korean, but looking back on it you don't even remember you read the entire story. Definitely worth it!!\n",
      "I am really confused by the hype regarding this film. Its an ok film but there is nothing special about a story of rich people living in a bubble and not connecting to the harsh realities of the Poor. So this film was judged to be better than 1917, joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the Irishman. It had long periods of boring non engaging dialogue and for sure soon will be forgotten .\n",
      "The way Bong directed this movie is amazing,no word can describe its details.It shows very aspect of class difference and ungratefulness.This movie to the meaning of class difference to a whole new level.Spoiler:In the movie,we see that the poor family has their toilet in the highest point of their house,this indicates that the poor class people's standard is even lower than the toilet\n",
      "Its hilarious , realistic , thriller , comedy , all in one\n",
      "In fact when I was first watching the movie I had no idea that it was nominated for any reward. To tell you tge truth I am absessed with kdramas and because of the country memtioned in the movie I was expecting sth in that scenario.\n",
      "Of course it has nothing with kdramas!\n",
      "Very interesting and for me a little unusual movie. It evakes emotions (mainly negative) but it doesn't mean to be bad. In my opinion art is about evoking emotions (no matter what kind of). So in this perspective this movie is all about art.\n",
      "The movie was excellent. It covered all the genres that you can think about, starting from comedy, ending with horror and if that's not all, add a naughty scene in there as well.While watching, my emotions changed along with the movie, at first I showed a lot of sympathy for the family, then I started to hate them a little bit because of their \"parasite\" mentality, then again I wasn't happy with the Parks since they were looking down on the poor.Another thing I really enjoyed about the end is that it was shown from two sides - from the rich and poor perspective. For the poor the big rain was devastating, however the rich enjoyed it since they can have have such a nice weather for the birthday party.Brilliant movie!\n",
      "It's strange that every design is obvious and seems to have many loopholes. It's like trying to get close to the positive and negative offsets in emotion. It's neither sensational nor critical, but it feels that there's something very dangerous hidden. I think it's very powerful, very powerful.\n",
      "I don't know how the Oscar jury works. This is just a normal movie that explains the rich and poor. That's all. I expected this to much better than snowpiercer. But it doesn't.\n",
      "Incredible twist that leaves you in disbelief. Must watch\n",
      "I know plenty of people disliked this movie, and understandably so - but I mean every word I say when I claim that this is one of the best movies I've seen. For fans of darker storylines with twists throughout, those who don't mind sitting still for a few hours and reading subtitles to get completely immersed into a story, this movie is a wonderful way to do so.\n",
      "An Incredible film with great cinematography and great acting. A true masterpiece with a funny yet heartbreaking story, and a well deserved best picture winner.\n",
      "Paracite is a suitable title fir this movie. Watch this movie. It has everything.\n",
      "Story is good nd it tells you that if u lie to anyone and take advantage of anyone u will face it one day thats the truth\n",
      "The movie completely breaks our whole expectation about the movie the actors are astonishing and the movie overall is fascinating.\n",
      "After watching the Oscars's and seeing the many awards this film won I decided to see it. It was a good movie. I was expecting so much more than just \"good\". It didn't move me emotionally the way I thought, or hoped it would. I didn't dislike it, but I wouldn't watch it again. Just like my review here, It was just ok.\n",
      "Definitely a movie you cannot judge by just watching it once. During my first watch, I went \"this is an enjoyable movie\" but then--once I got to watch it the next time, I came to see all the metaphorical/visual symbols that Bong Joon Ho ever so masterfully put in the production of the movie. As a Korean speaker, I did not need the subtitles but if you do need them, watching the movie twice (or thrice lol) will help you understand the movie better, because during your first watch, you can focus on the subtitles and during your second, you can pay more attention to all the visual details of the movie. Superb movie\n",
      "This movie was really good, interesting, unique, engaging, etc. Then the second half hit and it became phenomenal. I knew nothing about this movie going into it and I think that's the best way to go into it. I actually thought it was a sci fi/horror thing based on the title. It's not. It's socio-economic commentary, which I'm sure doesn't make it sound interesting but it is an absolute must watch. Up there with Oldboy in quality.\n",
      "This movie is a masterpiece. The acting, cinematography, script, and directing all combine to create excellent storytelling. This story truly makes you realize the steps people will go through to take what they believe they are owed and keep it. It really makes you reflect on humanity. Additionally, this gave me a huge appreciation for foreign films. Despite this being in Korean the story is so well paced and captivating that you forget you are reading subtitles. The lighting of this film plays a key role in its cinematography, a lot of the light comes from artificial light sources that are shown in the movie such as lamps, street signs, and reflections of water. This does a really good job of establishing the environment the characters are living in and allows us to truly see the comparison between the house they grew up in, to the mansion they invade. The acting feels very natural and it doesn't feel like you are watching a film so much as a documentary. Additionally, the use of voiceover does a great job of adding to the suspense of the story since it feels like we are learning things at the same time as the characters. Overall, this movie can give me tips for my own films with the importance of establishing a sense of environment, using strong acting, and the ability to tell stories out of order.\n",
      "I went to see Parasite in the cinemas... TWICE. This film is brilliant. It's funny in the most witty yet realistic way possible. It's deeply tragic. It's terrifying when you least expect it. Parasite leads you to believe that it's one thing, and suddenly transforms into another. It's a complete masterpiece. The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious. A repeat viewing is perhaps even more satisfying than the first, knowing what's THERE before it is revealed is just... a feeling I can't explain. It's a must watch. Not to be missed.\n",
      "It's a movie from an unfamiliar part of the world(South-Korea) that paints an uncannily familiar picture. But, be warned there are no victories in \"Parasite\" and no one gets away unpunished.The \"parasite\" of the title applies to every character in this film the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class.\"Parasite\" introduces us to the Kims, a South Korean family of four living in a basement apartment. They're so poor they can't afford Wi-Fi ,they leech it from nearby cafes and earn their meager income folding pizza boxes. A gift from the son's friend, a heavy stone that promises wealth to its owner, works its magic when the son, Ki-woo lands a job teaching English to a wealthy schoolgirl, Park Da-hye. She's part of the Park family, that looks like the negative (or maybe the positive) image of the Kims, living comfortably in a modernist mansion high on a hill.The Park patriarch Dong-ik is a tech CEO who's barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specializes in angry, rebellious scribbles.It's into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the family employed in the Park family. Their schemes are exhilarating, clever and intricately plotted.For much of the film the audience is swept up in the thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines.Much of this story, however, isn't told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They're a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame.\"Parasite\" moves effortlessly between capitalist parable, horror film and situation comedy as the natures of the two families are revealed: The Kims, grasping and greedy yet unfairly stigmatized by poverty (even in their newly bought clothes, they give off an odor that can't be masked), and the Parks, harmless and well intentioned yet coasting through life on the backs of others.\n",
      "Amazing. Though it's not a film you feel the need to see again as you probably would for other tens.\n",
      "A prophetic drama of the sublimation of class contradictions, the genre film's big frame, but showing all the artistic details, dislike the dramatic plot of this film, is not to see this film is absurd surrealism style.\n",
      "What I like most is the pan lens of Three people walking in the rainstorm of Keizer family after the rain, which is extremely clever and USES a class metaphor from top to bottom. \"Stone\" in the film the role and meaning is self-evident, a symbol of the base jersey - parasitic class nature and destiny, after rain, floating on the surface of the water, battered, parasitic, hypocritical, greedy nature, and in the space of dreams, \"stone\" sink in the bottom, metaphor true, really, composed of vision, the goodness of the parasitic class of its own.\n",
      "This film is not the great film that some say. Given we are so lost in class conflict reviewers act as if this says something about class and privilege. It doesn't beyond a few obvious scenes of class resentment. It also shows the bad influence of Tarantino by ending the film with idiotic and meaningless violence. It is clear that Hollywood like the rest of America is brutal in the way it cuts out any real mention of class so a film that highlights some obvious aspects of class conflict is seen as something special. This film is not special and Snowpiercer was far better. The rich are too clueless in this film (the rich are never this clueless, they are savage in the protection of their wealth--just look at the state of the world). And things happen without reason. Why would the maid let the maid in at night who was fired? Why wouldn't the rich check references on the people they let in their house? Why would the rich home owner accuse the driver without any real evidence? Still there are some great scenes, some memorable lines.\n",
      "\"The person who takes half a second to see into the essence of things, and the person who takes a lifetime to see into the essence of things, are doomed to be completely different destinies.\" This line is the best commentary on the fate of the two families in the film. Maybe, but more often to know, people for their own birth, the situation and so on have a lot of powerless and helpless, who do not want to live in the sun forever, let themselves let their families live a happy life, who want to live in the basement rent, but also be disgusted with the taste of poverty on the body?\n",
      "For me, as an Asian, I have to appreciate that film which expresses the wonderful story about social stratification. It has the inherent reason why it's a good film. You know the ability to tell a story meanwhile the story comes from our life is difficult. I wanna talk about a different point of view thinking about the kernel of the screenwriter. let's focus on the ending of this movie, such a spicy satire we saw. The envelope represents an impossible dream. Reality mixed up with the unreal, so the multiple-layered ending appears. And this ending tells audiences some principles in philosophical level at last.😊\n",
      "Such films are very multifaceted, you can look at them from different sides, so it's safe to say that after watching, each viewer will extract a unique emotion and impressions for himself. Secondly, not every film of this genre will \"go\" to everyone, since the creators of these creations do not set themselves to reach a large target audience. Recently I was able to view and evaluate it. About this movie I heard in a long time and now I can confidently recommend almost every fan of good cinema with meaning\n",
      "In order to better reveal the storyline and subject matter of the film, I propose to consider the main characters around which the narrative is constructed, which can be divided into two groups of \"poor\" and \"rich.\"\n",
      "One of the features of the film is a coup by the director of several genres at once. At the very beginning of the film, it's like a crime comedy, but then the notes of a thriller and drama are already revealed. In general, the movie is a buzz. Look, you won't regret it.\n",
      "The best description with which they could represent this movie, a plot of favors that you pay for until it is expensive. incredible well deserved that oscar\n",
      "Two families exploit each other with dire consequences. Beautifully shot and well acted, but devoid of emotional engagement. Little comedy, horror or tension and at no point did I care about anybody involved - which amounts to a wasted trip to the cinema, in my book. Very disappointing, given that it beat some truly exceptional films to the Oscar.\n",
      "The movie was good. The cinematography is flawless, the script is well written, and the story is wildly original. Parasite is funny, incredibly original, gorgeous, and dark all at the same time.\n",
      "If the process is to let all families living at the bottom of the society get rich first and then get rich, and slowly let all members of their own families become housekeepers of the rich family to teach drivers all living positions, the ending is somewhat unexpected. The late night visit of the original housekeeper completely broke the beautiful dream of the family. Of course, even without this, it may slowly show its feet over time. Because in addition to the two tutors, parents on the job because of their lack of quality slowly tried on the edge of the master. It was originally believed that the goodness and goodness of the rich couple and husband originated from wealth, and life was free of wrinkles. The poor woman said that if she had money, she would be kinder than the rich couple. However, this is not the case afterwards. I dislike the different tastes of the poor. It would be more sensation to use cheap panties left by the hostess, and at the end, I only care about my comatose son while ignoring the murderer and frequently assassinating myself in my yard. Tutors and housekeepers, and the look of picking up car keys in such critical times. The close-up portrayal makes the kind-hearted people completely collapse here.\n",
      "I hadn't read a lot about this film before watching it, so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew is it had won a lot of awards and was talked about for a long time.A film focused around a poor family who trick a highly wealthy family into hiring them for their skills.I had no idea where this film was going to go, there was so many different twists changing things up. It's a brilliant film, and the actors all did so well. If I had to fault anything, it would be that I didn't really see a tight family connection between the poor family.\n",
      "The transition in the story chapters in a dramatic ascending manner, with the appearance of shocking surprises in the last quarter, led to the wonderful feeling at the end of the film.\n",
      "A lie always needs to be rounded with more lies, be yourself, one step at a time. There's still a slight logical flaw in the plot. The lies from the suffering are pinned on the goodwill of others'homes, and the accidental interception in the middle forces a sudden change in human nature, and finally ends in tragedy!\n",
      "The high reviews for this movie say everything about the maturity of the critics and nothing about the so-called quality of this film. It's an average film. The story is mediocre and unoriginal. The humour is juvenile (exploding toilets tells you everything). The gore you'e definitely seen before. It is beautifully shot, and with a decent script the director could make a solid film but this certainly isn't it.\n",
      "The hype behind this film is unbelievable. I've been avidly watching Korean movies for years and had to see this one of course.It's very good, but if you've watched a good amount of Korean thrillers before it won't exactly blow you away. It has the slow burn that leads to a violent climax, dark humor... even the class warfare themes that are common in Korean movies.If you like Bong Joon-Ho movies you'll probably love it.\n",
      "I liked the film, to see a Korean film gain recognition is a breath of fresh air, South Korea is mainly known for its K-dramas not for niche films like this. The films mix of comedy and horror keeps you glued, and there's no clear protagonist and antagonist. Had a great time\n",
      "It's very good movie. You must watch this movie once in your life. Movie direction is great, story is amazing, acting cast I think everything is perfect.\n",
      "A true remarkable achievement in every aspect.There's so much about this movie. Name a genre; it's in it. Let it be comedy, mystery, thriller, romance, suspence, drama ; Parasite covered everything.The film keeps developing and the excitement for the upcomings never ends with multiple twists and turns. The film speaks so much about the class differences, mentalities of people having different living style to the hatred towards the people who are suffering in life. Even if we don't want to jump into those political statements, we can thoroughly enjoy the film to its core. Parasite is rare and original .\n",
      "The advance notice didn't have a spoiler at all. It's a long time since I saw such a movie that can arouse the audience's mood. The audience applauded several times in the middle of Cannes premiere. From laughter to horror to despair and grief, the director once again demonstrated his world's leading ability to integrate genre elements and social issues.\n",
      "Interesting story within two levels of society poor and wealthy people,\n",
      "Obviously overrated plain movie about social cheating. Surprisingly, the movie was well-received by Korean fans...\n",
      "The 2019 film \"Parasite\" is as simple as a stroke of brilliance by director Bong Joon-ho. The film perfectly encapsulates its message of classism in way that few would find offensive or biased. As both the Lower Class Parks and Upper Class Kim's are shown as living their lives to the best of their abilities. The classism perpetuated by the Kim's truly does not seem intentional, but rather from their misguided views about the world that simply leave them unaware of the suffering of lower class families such as the parks. One scene that beautifully encapsulates this unintentional ignorance of the Kim family is the scene of the rain. While the Kim's see the beauty of a rainy season saying that their son loves the rain. The Park's see the world completely differently, as the flood quite literally is a hazard and a destroyer of the park's sub basement living space. Even when a character looks evil such as the former house keeper and her husband, their motivations fit with their situation. When Chung Sook threatens to call the police, Moon Gwang is left with no other choice then to snap the picture of the family and threaten to expose the Park's. Near the end of the movie Geun Se goes on a murder spree but only as a way of revenge for the park's unintentional murder of Moon Gwang.\n",
      "I get it now. I understand the hype. This movie is tremendous. Its clever, intentional, and gripping throughout. Every line. Every set piece, every shot is on purpose. It works so deliberately toward its goal without being predictable. Its so absolutely tense, and crescendos in satisfactory fashion.A deep study on class and its implications in society as a whole. It asks questions like what does class hierarchy do to those who suffer from it? The story centers on people who are on the margins of society and are (forced?) to make some unseemly decisions. Who do you root for? And why?This movie WILL stand the test of time.\n",
      "I love it. The best film from Korea. Ty koreans! Is it still short? Really love it, I'm not joking.\n",
      "The shows some excellent combination of need and how a family lived in poor slum where even water got lodged during rain. The movie starts on some brilliant note showing how struggling life some people live with. But suddenly thier life changes time by time and all family members got employed. This also shows how their poverty forced them to lie. The movie on some point feels as real world situation. Overall it shows how and what problems a family have to went through for their family and forces them to do wrong things. Must watch !\n",
      "It exposes the reality of Korean society\n",
      "Surprise me!\n",
      "I like it very very very very very very very very very much👍\n",
      "I think the hype that they created for this movie was what caused me to build my expectations when I started watching the movie and I was kind of waiting for something to happen that would blow my mind, as the story progresses. But that moment never came... It just seemed to be just an ordinary movie and does not deserve the hype. The movie is completely overrated... watch it for yourself and tell me I am wrong. There was another reviewer who gave a low rating that said \"did we watch the same movie?\". That's exactly the feeling I got after watching the movie.Rating wise it's probably not a 3 but a 5 or 6 at best but I am so disappointed after watching the movie that I couldn't resist scoring it low.\n",
      "Oscar deserved, a wonderful production, incredibly necessary social criticism and fascinating development ... Everything very well produced, great performances, improbable and surprising situations, we almost sympathize with the evildoers, tricky with a good heart, or not, interesting, that none of them, no matter how bad whatever their actions were, they had good intentions, unreasonable ambitions... The simple, short, now black and almost imperceptible humor, I like very much, besides the suspense / terror / drama genre... I love...\n",
      "As a masterpiece sweeping Cannes, it is easy to understand and not dull.It is not easy to integrate commerce and art skillfully and popularize, but it has high artistic value.\n",
      "I absolutely loved it, the screenplay and story are really creative and tons of unexpected things happen.This movie is like a luxury handbag or watch, extremely well crafted on all aspects.10/10\n",
      "I have no idea how this got any good reviews. It was confusing and boring. Not for me.\n",
      "Excellent movie. Very nice plot. Everyone acted well.\n",
      "Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.\n",
      "Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece.\n",
      "I'm a guy who was born in 1961 and had never watched a film with English subtitles before.\n",
      "\" What An Entree \" & what was I waiting for !This film is fantastic in so many ways.Quite simply, devote your time to this, it is a must see.\n",
      "The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young adult offspring, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower working class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it, they, especially Mr. And Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when they have jobs, they do the minimum work required. Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day going to university. Despite not having that university education, Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in university. The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. And Mrs. Park ...\n",
      "The aptly named film Parasite is a tour de force. The aptly named title shows the ways that class struggle and poverty feeds on every frame of the film and colors the interactions between each and every one of the characters.\n",
      "This story is incredible- beautiful cinematography and excellent directing. The characters and relationships are dynamic and you can't look away. Not surprised that this won the Oscar for Best Film\n",
      "Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" is a brilliantly crafted film that deftly blends dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary to deliver a powerful narrative on class disparity and human nature. The story follows the impoverished Kim family as they scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, leading to unforeseen and explosive consequences.The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, with Song Kang-ho standing out as the resourceful yet morally ambiguous Kim Ki-taek. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their roles, making the characters both relatable and complex. The chemistry among the cast enhances the film's dynamic storytelling and emotional impact.Bong's direction is masterful, utilizing precise visual storytelling and meticulous pacing to build tension and reveal the characters' layers. The screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, is sharp and insightful, weaving humor and suspense seamlessly while offering biting social critique.Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography captures the stark contrast between the cramped, dingy quarters of the Kim family and the spacious, modern home of the Parks. The production design is equally impressive, with the Park household becoming a character in itself, symbolizing wealth and privilege.Jung Jae-il's haunting score underscores the film's shifting tones, enhancing both its comedic and dramatic moments. The film's editing by Yang Jin-mo ensures a tight narrative flow, maintaining a perfect balance between the film's various tonal shifts.\"Parasite\" is a thought-provoking exploration of social inequality, packed with unexpected twists and deeply human moments. Its critical acclaim, including winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes and four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, underscores its universal relevance and artistic achievement. Bong Joon-ho's genre-defying masterpiece is a must-watch, offering a gripping, unforgettable cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure.\n",
      "An OK movie, but it's light years away from even being a nominee for Oscar not to mention wining it.\n",
      "Lanthimos meets Ken Loach somewhere in Korea aand they direct an artistic version of Shameless.\n",
      "Incredibly well directed. Strong narratively with a consistent tone throughout. Unique.\n",
      "I thought it was an American film, but turned out to be Korean.The storyline is so well thought put. The story isn't slow and gets right too it. I love it. Let there be a number 2?Everyone acts soo well and i resonated with every character.Worth a 10/10.Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Now, what is there in the movie that gave it an Oscar? So the answer is its powerful but realistic concept. A difference that has spread among humans for centuries. I am rich you are poor, I will always be a master and you will always be a servant. Every time you watch the parasite, you will get a new perspective in the story. This is one of those films that you cannot understand very well at once. The ending of the movie has been cleverly presented so that every human can understand it with his thought. The direction of the movie is so vicious that you try to mind each of the senses of the movie, even then you will be forced to give up. The movie's original language is Korean, but despite this, people around the world are appreciating it.\n",
      "A movie worth watching... comedy, drama and thriller combination with a twist ending.\n",
      "Parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece. Having won many awards at the 92nd Academy Awards like Best International Feature Film, this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting, cinematography, and its relatability. Based in Korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the Kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned. Parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall, creating such believable families. The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting. Its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a must-watch alongside its technical aspects. It's an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally. All these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience, which makes it stand above the rest.\n",
      "I can not believe that this movie won any awards at all. Horrible. It started off ok and transitioned into something where it seemed that the writer ran out of creative juice, then in a desperate attempt to write a movie script, just wrote a bunch of pointless drivel that had no real substance or connection to the story line. This was really 2 movies butted up against each other.I think that the awards given to Parasite should be given to the next in line that did not win, because they were robbed. C'mon Hollywood. This is no way to show how 'woke' you are. I want my money back.\n",
      "Well,this is a pretty decent movie.It is well written and its cinematography and background music is brilliant.I enjoy the tension it brings me everytime the Ki family was almost be caught.It is woefully that there are still gap between the rich and the poor.Like other good movies,there are no certan villian or hero in this movie.Despite this,I still can't get into this film.It is just not my type.\n",
      "This is a story of a poor family who decides to wage war on many fronts. There are some moments that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you in shock.\n",
      "I noticed from the first minute of Bong Joon Ho's Parasite that there was more too it than meets the eye.Every beat of the story is a huge plot turn that you never see coming. There's so much depth to each character that each one feels like an individual puzzle box.Some might be turned off by the Korean dialect, but you're literally going to miss it if you turn away (unless you speak Korean, of course).When you're not looking at the subtitles, your eyes are locked on the amazing visuals and beautiful set design.Trust me, following the subtitles will be the least of your worries.Slightly long-winded, but brilliantly crafted.\n",
      "I want to salute this movie's director... When I watched this movie, I fell in love with movie's director. Don't hesitate to watch this movie\n",
      "Parasite is one of the best films I have seen this decade I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "No spoilers in this review.\n",
      "I hope that every film buff sees this wonderful piece of art. Not often does a filmmaker pull off this amount of creativity. Bravo!\n",
      "Parasite better than Joker. And it won the Oscar. Joker is only just good, Parasite is perfect. Deal with it.\n",
      "I would agree if it was best picture at the Razzies.This was woeful. I hated every second.\n",
      "I was avoiding the movie for several months, because I wasn't sure how I feel about korean movies - I have a history with korean dramas and korean music, but the movies - there are a few, that I have seen and let's jut say that they weren't my cup of tea. But because of the nominations, I decided that I shoudn't skip the movie. And I am NOT sorry at all. Parasite is just a masterpiece and totally deserved to win the Oscar\n",
      "Even the poster for this movie is perfect. It's full of heartbreak, intrigue, suspense. There's wonderful acting and beautiful camera work. The colors are fantastic. The only downfall is having to pay attention to the captions the whole time, but I watch all movies with subtitles anyways, so not that big of a deal, and certainly not a negative when it comes to this movie.\n",
      "As the title reads, I was so invested in the movie that when the very violent climax began I had to run out of the theatre where I passed out on the floor because of the blood shed. I went to the hospital and was there for nine hours; the fact that I still love this movie is a testament to how great it truly is!!\n",
      "This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. It was full of hidden messages and had a clever message over all, would recommend.\n",
      "I thought this kind of poverty existed only in India. But the way the movie depicts the needs of the common man in Korea and to the extent they go to secure a job is fantastic. The screenplay is very tight and the movie gives ample space to all actors to perform their role well. There is no unnecessary scenes or actors involved. The end is very tragic and touches your heart. How a small thing like securing a job could lead to so much bloodshed.\n",
      "After hearing about this movie praises continually since 2020, I decided to finally check it out. I'm glad I did. Parasite is a thoroughly entertaining film with great directing, great writing and phenomenal acting. It's one of the best pictures to win in recent times and one of the best foreign-language films I've ever seen.I didn't care much for the ending however. I wish it could have had a happy ending, even as unrealistic as that may be. And just when the film makes you think that, that the remaining family got the rich house and the father no longer had to hide way down in the depths of the basement as another \"parasite\" it was all just a daydream.But it's still a very strong film, very thought provoking. It grabbed my attention from the start and not because it was in another language.\n",
      "So Boring and predictable, i guess people who says is a good movie need to watch more cinema. The Oscar for best movie is a joke but we all know why the gave you the award. Is a shame people just think this is a good movie just cause some Youtubers said that, but is not there are good movies in Korean fellas and this one is not one of them.\n",
      "A New kind of story with an amazing take on the economic instability in the Korean societyA nice way to depict the ecnomic imbalance in the society with a beautiful and unthinkable scriptA must watch story and too many hidden messages or meaning in the script\n",
      "I went into the movie pretty skeptical - I'm not normally huge on thrillers, but Parasite pulled out all the right stops. The film was shot well, the score was impressive but not overbearing, and there was hardly a dull point over its two hour run time. Absolutely deserving of the acclaim it's received, and a must watch for those who enjoy social commentary and gripping storytelling.\n",
      "Great acting and beautiful camera. Surprising plot turns and very good suspense that oftentimes gets released with a lot of humor. Crazy culmination and somewhat open end, not sure what the story ultimately wants to tell the viewer.\n",
      "This is one of the best films of 2019. It's intense, satirical and emotional without ever feeling disjointed. The film can literally turn on a dime from being hilarious to being suspenseful and it feels seamless. The acting is incredible and the films direction is excellent. The conclusion is very emotional.\n",
      "A story with interesting characters will keep you glued till the end. It portrays people in the society in a very simple but clear way. A film worthy of the Oscars.\n",
      "This is a nice movie with full of metaphor. I don't say this is a masterpiece like many people say but I don't agree that someone say it is a mediocre movie. Personally, I don't want to watch this movie again because it is too profound. I felt uncomfortable after watching it. I think this is exactly what the director's intention and actually he succeeded on that point.\n",
      "A waste of time, of energy and of the stuff that award trinkets are made of. Why this shallow so-called satire has received accolades around the globe is far beyond me, but there you go: it's the emperor's clothes all over.\n",
      "This movie is the best movie of the year, all scenes are amazing, and it has a very good message\n",
      "Ok this cool but i think the end of the chapter 1 move is so boring\n",
      "Satisfying and unexpected unfolding of plot.\n",
      "Put you through different emotional states during its runtime\n",
      "Despite of conflict in mind about actors and villain, all characters are equally valuable. You will care for each of them.\n",
      "It almost covers all of the genre\n",
      "It is one of best film i watched. It brilliantly shows the greed, dark secrets and other emotions.\n",
      "I am not a movie enthusiast, to be frank. Have seen some of the good movies. Most of them were really very good. Watched this one after it had won oscars and created a lot of buzz. I hate to say this but i couldn't agree with most of the audiences here. I think it is overrated. I can't explain why. Well, not now. May be sometimes later. But, yeah it is overrated. Its a good one time watch though. Can't recommend to anyone i can think of right now. Sorry.\n",
      "I watched this movie as I had heard great reviews about it. I don't normally go for movies with subtitles as I find them difficult to watch and read at the same time, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I wasn't sure of the plot and had made a point of not reading up on it before I watched it. I was not disappointed!\n",
      "I do enjoy something a bit different, and this delivered.\n",
      "A bit of suspense, horror and a touch of humour, highly recommended.\n",
      "Wondering what's the purpose behind this scenario, I hate it in all details.\n",
      "After watching this great movie. Somebody ask\n",
      "To describe the in 1 sentence. Lol. That's my review and I'm sticking to it. I know this won the academy award but I just never thought it would be something I would like. Acting was great. Screenplay was tight. Def watch it.\n",
      "The film demonstrates poverty, desperation and inequality. It dramatizes the extreme differences in the world between wealthy and poor family.\n",
      "It is a suspenseful movie with some unexpected twists that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Watch and judge for yourself, I totally recomend it.\n",
      "Korean cinema, subtitled I thought would be a turn off but the satirical, black comedy of the screenplay strikes a chord and the story makes you forget those barriers.\n",
      "The story is of different social classes. A poor family (mother, father and two grown up children) who live in squalid conditions, a kind of basement.\n",
      "They are all unemployed and penniless.One of the children, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) somehow gains or should I say blags employment as an English tutor to the daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso) of the rich Park family with a CEO father, a dim wife and two children who live in opulent conditions, a big house with a large landscaped garden.Through sheer cheek Ki-woo hatches his smart sister on the scam as an art tutor to the Park's young son.\n",
      "Later his sister conceives to get the Park's driver fired and replaced conveniently by her father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho).By now you get the just of the screenplay as even mother gains employment as the housekeeper. The entire 'poor' family are scamming the rich Park family.The film abounds with black comedy, spoiled somewhat by a blood splattered finale.The director, and writer Bong Joon-ho also delivered social commentary film Snowpiercer (2013) and seems to deliver leftist films in the vein of some famous Western filmmakers.Funny film, showing class difference. The smelly, poor family struggling to survive against the rich but a bit dim at times, Park's.Good film, if a little overrated by the Awards fraternity and some critics.\n",
      "An engaging and thrilling masterpiece from the great Bong Joon-ho.\n",
      "Its many wins and Oscar nominations should be enough to summarize the film Parasite as it was put on a pedestal at this year's academy awards due to its incredible cinematography and well written script. Going into watching the film, I had many high expectations, as I was aware of its at that time many nominations and high praise by those who had seen the film. I was quickly let down to realise that although these many things were true about the film, I found it to be a very long two hours to sit down and watch the film. Perhaps this was because of its slow establishment at the start, or maybe the film was just not something that I would normally be interested in, but I didn't enjoy it. I was really disappointed by this, because it was clear that the incredible production that went in to the film was truly something to set it apart. As far as the movie goes, I thought that it was very strong, the script seemed to be very developed for its nature, and the camera work was beautiful. For me, the plot just didn't grab my attention, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys films of a similar genera. Above the high praise that critics seemed to pick out about the film, its main theme seemed to center around the American Dream. In my opinion I believe that the film did in fact summarize the American Dream. Not only did the characters acquire wealthy jobs, but they managed to stick together as a family. Although their financial situation could have been handled in much better ways, I believe that the bond that they created as a family is definitely the epitome of a dream, as money can't always buy you happiness.\n",
      "Self-righteous, preachy, and completely awful. Slow year in movies I suppose. Shouldn't have won anything besides a Razzie. Blech. Barf. Bunk.\n",
      "On my first watch i thought it was just an ok movie. I thought \"What did I miss? Why is everyone so crazy about this movie?\". I watched it again and i Change my mundo. It really is a great movie\n",
      "The film doesn't just 'make you think', it opens up the brain. You leave the hall on wobbly legs and do not perceive reality for a long time. 'Parasite' deserves every second of that 15 minute standing ovation at the festival and so much more. This must be watched, because this is not a tragicomedy, this is life - beautiful and disgusting at the same time, but very instructive and 'metaphorical'.Love your family, make honest plans, and don't take what doesn't belong to you.\n",
      "I actually didn't expect the movie to go in a series tone at almost half time. Normally thought it would have been a comedy entertainer like those classic Korean movies. I really liked how they conveyed the idea of rich people being selfish when a situation arises and poor people remain always poor no matter what they do. The actors did a tremendous job playing each role and their relationships with each other.\n",
      "Bathing the sun in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, and breathing the air in the dark room can only walk away like a ghost. Embracing a poor stone will never let go, and the cheap smell will never be eliminated. Bed bugs curled up in the ground, sterilizing themselves by opening windows with medicaments; hosts in high places hire money to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked up the blood of the poor, and the poor lived in the house of the rich. The ghosts and the ghosts shared food in the same room.\n",
      "I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Unpredictable and very emotional. The bad reviews are from simple minded self made \"movie critics\" unable to comprehend anything deeper. The movie is not bad just because you were bored and didn't understand it.\n",
      "Simply amazing, one of the best korean movies I've ever seen. There is no word to describe this. Just watch it, you won't regret\n",
      "(((Somw sciences are not suitable for family or teens )))\n",
      "The story is about a poor Korean Family, and it's 4 members,who live in an underground floor basement, which gets flooded with the slightest of showers. They do different sorts of part time jobs,for a living. Their fortune changes, when one of the friend's of a family member offers him to teach English to a rich house's girl, in his absence. Fortune of the poor family soon changes (and later they knew it changed for ever) , as they become fully dependant upon the rich family, for their living (just like a parasite and a host).\n",
      "The real thrill starts, after they poor family discover a hidden truth about the rich house.\n",
      "This film is honestly a masterpiece. The plot is not complex yet incredible, making the audience feel so deeply intangled in the movie.It makes you appreciate the intelligence of the director with the cuts and methods of filming that you wouldn't even realise has an impact on your overall feel of the film.Other critics exclaiming it is overhyped or cry that we are supposed to feel a certain type of way, are not open minded at all. There is no type of way we SHOULD specifically feel about the characters in this film, and they do not appreciate the simplicity yet grasping nature of this film.\n",
      "Family of cons get in deeper than they intended while trying to live a life they don't deserve. Unexpected twists and startling action, which does not deviate too far from possible reality.\n",
      "I like the film, the way the director presented the family, trying to fit into an non realistic life, but the get exposes by the smell of the poverty.\n",
      "Let me, in the beginning, simply pay tribute to the genius of Bong Gran Ho who gave us a commercially successful entertaining movie. Anyone can see it and be happy, but at the same time it is real and painful, carrying symbols and social comments. Very important, a masterpiece from Bong Joon Ho.\n",
      "Gisaengchung is a really good film. I really liked the story and how the family is slowly taking control of the rich family. The methods to make fire the employees are really smart and realistic. Althought I don't think deserve all the prizes he had.\n",
      "It's a really good film, I can't deny it but it isn't incredible.\n",
      "The poor family is also really endearing so we can better dive in the movie and his atmosphere. The the plot twists are very surprising and unexpected (i won't spoil).\n",
      "And finally the end is also unexpected and really clever, but also a little bit disapointing. I recommend this movie.\n",
      "Get your senses heightened. Parasite is one hell of a movie. It's so hauntingly simple and elegant, I couldn't believe what happened in the end. I just sat where I was, spellbound. With awesome story, acting, direction, music, exquisite art direction (the interiors of the Park residence took my breath away) and cinematography (even the slum area looks awesome), Parasite totally deserves all of the awards.\n",
      "I often go to the movie but never write any reviews. Given all the fuss around this one, I felt the need to make an exception: this is so overrated. Do not get me wrong, it's not bad: camera work is good, story is not boring and acting is ok for the most parts (with the possible exception of the girl trying to act drunk on the sofa - think Japanese drama). But describing this as the film of the decade? I guess you need to be pretty illiterate in movies.\n",
      "Korean movies are far better than Hollywood. Have you seen the productions they do? They care a little bit more on the quality rather than gaining money doing low budget movies.\n",
      "The film is one of the best examples taking us to the past cinematography, when the storyline, screenplay and acting are so organically harmonized. It does not have a \"happy end\" but gives the exellent picture of the modern society full of harmfool idols.\n",
      "The greatest thing about this movie is that the rich actually do nothing wrong.The couples love each other, the children are happy. No cheating, no cold violence, no child abuse. They are really really kind and simple, but you just can't help but hate them.\n",
      "Seems like Oscar jury team selects favourite foreign movie based on how much poverty in it and congrats this time they get South Korean poverty and they nominated as the best movie in all categories. movie is good but not that great, no big surprise in it and kinda straight forward.\n",
      "Contains every genre u can think of ..desrved oscar\n",
      "The film is about 2 social classes, rich and poor actors very well, I am worth 8/10 for this film very well\n",
      "I will keep it short go see this film everyone. Totally deserves all its awards a masterpiece in film making by the director who gave us memories of murder. If you are a fan of Korean movies you will clearly love it and if you arent this may change your perception. It has it all comedy, drama, thriller you name it all merge beautifully.ENOUGH SAID GO SEE IT NOW.\n",
      "Are u kidding me. im speechless. idk have anything left to say. pls imbd let me post this.\n",
      "Brilliant screenplay Strory telling\n",
      "Director had done his job very very.... Awesomely\n",
      "Actors act brilliant\n",
      "Excellent story and concept\n",
      "Must watch for everyone....\n",
      "Much less, not a Hitchcockian one.\n",
      "Perfect performance of all actors, specially Yeo-jeong Jo (the rich mother) and So-dam Park (the smart sister of the poor family).\n",
      "The movie is a perfect mix of black comedy with a little suspense. But it's not a thriller.\n",
      "Perfect contrast between the rich family and the poor one. The cinematography is perfect when it shows this contrast during the storm.\n",
      "After I watched the movie, one question remains to me: who was the real parasite in the movie?\n",
      "Such a brilliant film, I've been thinking about it all day and I saw it last night, I tried to think of any faults with this film, there are none! Funny, and suspenseful and edge of your seat! One of the best films I've ever seen!\n",
      "It's a harmonious asian mixture made of black comedy, thriller and psychological movie. It seems that Korean society offers an appropriate frame for this good movie. Young actors are really beautiful.\n",
      "Loved this movie, refreshing to watch something different from the usual mumbo jumbo.\n",
      "Plenty of symbolic moments and a lot of unexpected twists to the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat practically yelling at the TV 'what is happening!?' whilst holding my head in my upturned hands. Parasite is basically a masterpiece. I was gripped instantly by the trailer and knew I had to watch it. I noticed a few goofs which incidentally others have too as they're written on here, luckily it doesn't detract from the storyline as there's no plot holes.\n",
      "I rarely enjoy a movie 100% but this one is definitely up there as a new favourite. Evoking a lot of different emotions throughout, well worth a watch.\n",
      "Ok .. everyine give high rating but i said this is a bad movie.. the acting is good.. but the movie is not..\n",
      "The plot was good . There were some funny scenes and it was a simple and decent movie you can go for with your family anytime. Definitely a good time killer.\n",
      "I had no prior knowledge about this movie going into it, but afterwards I knew I got done seeing one of the most well-crafted films I've ever watched.\n",
      "It's awesome really awesome\n",
      "I couldn't think that it will gone so far\n",
      "Oh god i loved this movie\n",
      "I loved this movie. The director has a really beautiful touch and the dialogue and plot twists had me constantly intrigued and surprised.I absolutely loved the character of KiJung - the sister. I would like to watch a whole movie about her character - it is so uniquely nonchalant and self-serving that it is a delight to watch - you simply don't see or hear of people like this.I felt the ending was beautiful and just ever so slightly rushed. Still the best movie of the year for me and a worthy oscar winner.Rent it/ buy it and enjoy.\n",
      "Bong Joon Ho had done a great job. One of the most original international script and his directing was brilliant. The plexal events leads the scipt to a wonderful inevitable ending that would both expected and harshly expected by the audience. I can't say much about acting since I don't know Korean but the story slowly swallowed me up. Mostly with the raising the complexity of the plex of the plot as I mentioned.\n",
      "Personally, I have of course no doubt about its originality and uniqueness, however I still think that maybe the best international film award would go to Almadovar's Pain and Glory as Parasite was declared as the Best Picture of the year.\n",
      "Many dialogues are impressive, like a spear stabbing my heart.\n",
      "I watched Parasite and liked it very much, first of all, the soundtrack of the movie was great, its script and subject were gripping, it definitely deserves the Oscar. The last 20 minutes of the movie are excited and tense before it is excited but the last 20 minutes are raising the bar to the top.\n",
      "If you never knew that rich people are somewhat uptight and poor people somewhat desperate, this movie is for sheltered daisies like you I guess.\n",
      "One of the best movies I've seen in year's. Thank God\n",
      "I wasn't quite sure where this movie was going at first but like with all good movies, this one puts this caper into place with precision. The only criticism I would give is that it plays out quite slowly. In fact, there are some areas that I felt could have been cut from the movie to save a little time but not detract from how the story is told.I won't go into too much detail about the movie as I don't want to spoil anything. All I will say is that this movie is really enjoyable, has good humour and sorrow but overall, it plays out brilliantly and it is certainly understandable why it won an oscar for best picture and best screenplay, to name a couple.\n",
      "Amazing idea. Love the way it's filmed. Would definitely recommend watching, was not expecting it to go the way it went at all!\n",
      "What I love about this movie... it's a blast to watch, very original, and the directing is some of the best. The originality is a huge plus to me, because it feels like there's not much of it to go around right now.But as far as the negative (I'll spend a little longer on this because theirs so much praise already).. I feel like all the best drama in the movie feels manufactured. I felt like the director had the poor father stab the rich one for a dramatic conclusion, whether it was justified or not, a mechanism to show the movie had some dramatic point. Almost hamfisted in, but never organically produced.The rich family behaved like bosses in a typical work environment. Seemed dismissive at times, even gullible, but in many ways, incredibly generous and trusting, if not creating opportunity and doing more good than required. The director may say, there's no good guys and bad guys, but, shouldn't we at least feel like theirs a motive behind the final killing? I should have been thinking, I hope he doesn't kill him, I hope he doesn't kill him.. but instead I was just thinking, why is this disgruntled cab driver grabbing a knife to kill the rich father of all people? There's a murderer who just killed his son, who is being carried through the courtyard by the rich daughter of all people, trying to get him some help. The rich father commented that he liked the cheap panties, but that didn't relate to the message at all, he didn't even know they were the driver's daughter's. Seemed like a cheap inclusion to build motive for the dramatic killing. Did he look down on the family? Not really, he was a boss and was even caring, and didn't even know they were a family. The poor father stabbing him in front of everyone put his own family at risk and hurt their ability to function even further, and although you knew he was upset, it didn't feel like that level of aggression worked with his character at this point in the film.Overall, the message didn't come across succinctly. I think the director would probably say, the rich should be more aware of the pains in the community. So no-one can ever have something nice, ever again, until everyone is rich. The only way this rich family could have over come their flaws, is if they had ensured that everyone in the world had a good day the day before.If I want to get really critical, I would say that the director wanted to make a funny, political, and scary movie, and therefore threw in random scenes to sensationalize his script. Like when the old maid comes to the door... of course they wouldn't let her in if the movie was being honest. And that's what enabled all the incredible drama, was this poor decision made with unclear motivation. They're all hanging out inside, eating food, broken bottles on the floor, openly making a mess of the the house for the first time, this could blow their whole operation they meticulous planned, and were cunning and quick on their feet in every other scene, but they decide to let her inside always, oh well. Could have just told her to come back? So, then they find a poor family living downstairs, which is random and sort of unrelated to the story and the point of it... but they find a poor guy there and so the protagonist mother decides to turn them in. What needs to happen to create the next sensational moment? Well, if the family living downstairs were to just happen to discover the entire secret of the poor family before the mother calls the cops in 5 seconds, then we could have a fight to the death. What happens next? Well, the entire family comes tumbling down the stairs and the downstairs family gets video proof of them referring to each other by their family names, etc. If any of those random, highly unlikely, and unrelated elements don't happen in this short sequence, the entire movie ends with the family making a little money as an uber driver, a maid, and 2 tutors. But, the movie needed to go bigger. So, we have these unintuitive moments driven by unclear motives tacked on to ensure we get the killing and dark moments and dramatic political messages that can only be found in the second half. Now we've got the pieces, at the expense of depth. Almost seems like a fun, silly movie with random political narratives to increase the clout. Like it's a movie that's supposed to make you feel good, because you just got to watch a comedy, a thriller, and then became a better person because of the mechanically meaningful scenes. I mean, if this is how you make a great movie, you could literally use this as a template, because again, it could be a manufacturing process. But since the feeling of moral fulfillment comes by way of cheap design, and gives a bit of hollowness to the final experience.So, I rate this 8! 8 because of the direction and originality. 2 stars gone because of the artificial nature of the climax. I don't like crapping on a movie this good, but it's off my chest now and there's plenty of positive reviews, so I'll leave some of that to them. :)\n",
      "Craziest movie I've ever seen! There were so many plot twists. The script must have taken a century to write.\n",
      "Well deserved best movie of the year!You have to watch it untill someone thinks to copy it! It's brilliant!\n",
      "Normally i stay away from foreign movies but this one changed my mind,also i do not write reviews this one deserves it!\n",
      "The architectural design of the building has made a special contribution to the film\n",
      "Overhyped, nothing great to watch.. It is Common story of society.\n",
      "This is by far the best movie that I've seen in a while! That doesn't necessarily mean a lot, but this movie is all you want: Beautiful cinematography, great cast, good writing! I will keep it short as one can easily say something that gives a hint to the story. Don't read any other reviews... You need to see this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible.\n",
      "Here's how i rate a movie the fast way, i ask myself two questions. Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ? Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future.\n",
      "Why this film won the Oscar?Film is OK but Oscar??? Noo!!!10 point?? Noo!!!If you understood why this film won the Oscar, tell me why... :))\n",
      "I'll keep this as short and simple as possible.Was at the top of my watch list until I heard from just about everyone I knew who saw it tell me it was \"okay.\" Bar none. So why, I thought, do all the Critics write about how great it is? Or why the score is so high on IMDb? And so, my curiosity got the better of me....Right from jump-street, they pulled that silly \"Korean movie\" humor. You know, the kind that everyone in the States pretends is funny but really isn't. The fumigation scene, as one example, had me say aloud:\"Not this stupid sh**.\"I'm sure everyone south of the DMZ burst out into laughter so it must be cultural or something because it's not funny.Next we have the \"poor,\" who in this movie are poor for a reason. And yet they are savvy hustlers that turn out to be smarter than the \"rich\" family. Make any sense? That \"rich\" family, by the way, being gullible enough to fall for just about every trick in the book. I suppose they just got lucky prior to all this? Satire or not, is that really how life works?The ending was predictable of course, just not in the actual way it occurred. Style points here ... I guess.It's (another) one of those movies that's \"different.\" Unfortunately, that doesn't make it good. Not bad - but unimpressive.\n",
      "Overrated film,\n",
      "a naive and commonplace view of the modern life with absence of deepening and with scenes just to impress us, but from a technical view have a mastery of skill.\n",
      "A low-class, jobless, loser family unexpectedly turns out to be a bunch of devilishly refined intriguers who invade (like parasites) an innocent high-class family. Many irrealistic turns. The end is both pathetic and ridiculous. The script is both psychologically and socially inane.\n",
      "What a shame that Kim Ki-Duk the great Korean director has never won an Oscar, and this patchwork has.\n",
      "All the high-class characters are just humane, and all the low-class ones are corrupt. I'm very surprised reading in reviews and criticisms that this film was leftist or critical about capitalism and inequality in any way. It wasn't. The message is the old high-class commonplace that wealth makes you noble, and poverty ignoble. No question about whether creating such inequalities, wealth, and poverty systematically was noble or ignoble. It's just natural condition, y'know, that's life, a great struggle with winners and losers. The happy end of the film is that one of the parasites finally decides to make money, so everything will be solved.\n",
      "I'm afraid that this message was the reason why the brave new winner people loved this movie so much, and also why they have all misunderstand it.\n",
      "Has a good moral but not a good movie to watch.\n",
      "The movie starts of good and seems interesting but eventually it becomes worse as the movie goes on.\n",
      "Surely not a feel good but kind of a family crime drama.\n",
      "This movie has one excellent idea and one clever twist. Cinematography was great and the overall setting ambitious. Yet, it seems quite overrated. Attempted allegory about capitalism is rather obvious. The movie lacks true emotions and feels forced. There is no character development or subtle interactions between characters. I felt disconnected with the main characters which made the movie boring despite the plot-driven concept.\n",
      "How the hell did this garbage win the best film award? Better yet, how was it even nominated?\n",
      "It was so horrible, I stopped watching after the first 15 minutes. Poor acting! Very basic story without a plot. Worst of all, who wants to read captions and listen to this other language.\n",
      "I look at all these other reviews with 10s and elaborate comments, and I wonder what exactly people are thinking! It is shameful that the Academy allowed this foreign film to compete against all the other amazing films of the year.\n",
      "Was this some kind of sick political statement?\n",
      "Beautiful scenery. Wonderful acting. Worst plot, ending. I want my money back.\n",
      "Best foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.How did Joker get overlooked?\n",
      "It has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well.\n",
      "I am sorry but this movie is garbage, and anyone who is convincing themselves otherwise really needs to give their head a shake. This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917. I know that movie opinion is very subjective, buut surely I cannot be the only avid moviegoer who feels like this.\n",
      "By it, i mean Oscar worthy.Like some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place.The movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does.My humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't.\n",
      "It does not represent neither the human being nor the humankind\n",
      "It's important to watch in original language\n",
      "The actors are really awful and the ensemble does not convey anything.\n",
      "The direction is always not enough to create the right path!\n",
      "Do not watch!\n",
      "The plot is implausible. The premise is boring. The movie is boring. The characters are not interesting or likable. I forced myself to make it halfway through to see if the plot was going anywhere . . . It wasn't.If you want to see a good Korean movie, go watch the Original, Korean version of Oldboy.\n",
      "Parasite (2019)OUCH!Pls make this director stop.\n",
      "What a boring movie. I can't believe there are some people who like it. And it got an Oscar, joke.\n",
      "The beginning of this film is fun and it reminds of a sitcom. Unfortunately, ending and movie's message are disappointing.If you are a normal, non-envious and not frustrated person you presume that the poor Kim family is \"parasiting\" on the rich Park family, using tricks and lies - which by any standard is NOT ok.\n",
      "However in the end director is sending a different message.The rich family is somehow \"parasiting\" on the poor family and the director tries desperately to depict them as stupid and naive people that only care about themselves even though the poor family lies, steals, and kills.Through this film, the director shows his childish views of the world where income inequality must never exist and if you're poor it's okay to commit crimes because boo-hoo I'm poor give me money.It is a shame because it starts as a promising movie but it ends up too political.\n",
      "3-Star for the amazing house and some of the cinematography, but nothing compares to the cinematography of some of the other epic films. The other 7-star for a film that's makes Dumb and Dumber and Mr Bean masterpieces.\n",
      "Since many critics and the Academy are swooning over this Korean film, I was compelled to go to the theater, pay my admission and be ready to read English titles for over two hours. I kept an open mind and found the first third of the two plus hours to be interesting. Mind you, none of the characters were especially likeable--the lower class basement dwellers or the upper class snowflakes living in the architectural digest modern mansion.The lower class family were the true parasites, smelly low class leeches looking for and finding every possible way to become what they weren't--classy.After the son, the daughter, the father and then the mother managed to become tutor, analyst, driver and cook, the plot thickened and to me went off the rails. A hidden bomb shelter, a husband living in that tomb for four years, a biblical rain storm miraculously not causing anyone of the submerged characters (with hundreds of electrical wires floating overhead) to be instantly electrocuted, cell phones to continue to work after being equally submerged. Not at all believable. And then........The skies cleared and a gala lawn party was planned at the modern mansion. Here's where I could see Jordon Peele becoming royally pissed. Wasn't all the crazy knife wielding and weird stuff done in Get Out? Yes, it was! So the Academy voters had to make amends for not giving Peele the Best Picture Oscar. Instead they gave it to this two plus hour Korean gab fest.I left the theater feeling absolutely empty. Not moved, not caring, but wondering just why did the performers all have three names?Avoid if you haven't already given your valuable time.\n",
      "I just can't understand how this ridiculous picture got an Oscar. The whole film is based on a single absurd premise: a self-made multimillionaire, a supposedly savvy businessman lets a bunch of grifters into his house without bothering to get a background check? Really? I'm willing to suspend disbelief when watching a movie, but that Grand Canyon-sized plot hole was just too big to overcome and colored my view of the whole picture. I kept on watching hoping to find out if there was something going to happen that would make me want to care about any of the characters. Didn't happen.And that ridiculous Grand Guignol finale. Gallons of fake blood for no discernable reason does not a cinematic masterpiece make.\n",
      "Stunned at how anyone would think highly of this film. It should have been a short. Every aspect of the story line was so predictable and poorly executed. Not even a single spin that could have made it interesting. Do not pay to see this movie. Stream for free or just don't even watch it.\n",
      "This \"movie\" is anything but good. I do not understand why some critics say it is a masterpiece!?!? Wtf!!! At least 7 movies of 2019 where far better. The movie is improbable and pretentious! Very dumb movie.\n",
      "I watched it because of the excellent reviews. It starts as an interesting and creative film, but be aware that it turns out to be a very violent and depressing movie.\n",
      "I really don't understand why some people call it a \"masterpiece\".\n",
      "Yes it is creative and thought provoking, but if you finish watching it with a very bad feeling, then in my opinion it doesn't worth watching at all.\n",
      "I have to admit that the main idea of this Korean film is very good. It is different from the majority of the films I have seen, but for me it was inadequate.\n",
      "The first 40-45 minutes are the main part of the movie. You understand what is going on. The rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first 40 minutes. It becomes boring.\n",
      "The acting is just good.\n",
      "Nice effort.\n",
      "This is a movie with no story!!! I dont know what they tried to do!!! Is it that easy to recruit people for job!!! Then the criminals killed 3 innocent lives!!! They even escaped the law & jurisdiction!!! I just didnt like it. Waste of time & boring movie. And most importantly no moral.\n",
      "I didn't understand the film. Maybe because of the Korean style of life! But for sure for me it was just a waste of time!\n",
      "At the beginning it seems to be a comedy, a stupid comedy, but slightly pleasant. All the characters seem to be stupid, liars, but also gullible children.\n",
      "But then, this stupid comedy turns on into a very bad horror movie.\n",
      "And at the end, ... a very stupid .... Happy end!I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively.... but steel I think I'm wright and the others are wrong or are manipulated by politics!.I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is a very bad and stupid film!\n",
      "Please for God sake dont waste your time in seeing this worst ever movie.\n",
      "There is something truly wrong with our world when this movie is so overly hyped up. I wanted to walk out of the movie theater but I paid $20 for the movie ticket. The acting - NOT GOOD. Story Line - PREDICTABLE. Just watch something else - don't make the same mistake as I've done. You're been warned!\n",
      "You know how good movies make you feel, leaving you expired and with some thoughts and questions in your mind. Well it's not one of them. The only question this movie leaves you with is: \"What is this\" and the only though is \"I just wasted 2 hours and 12 minutes of my life\".\n",
      "The whole movie doesn't have a flow, is so predictable in the first part, like they try to put oh the poor vs the rich, phrases like 'oh he smells like underground'. Whatever the creators wanted to show they failed.\n",
      "Watching this movie thinking it got all the Oscars made this bad movie feel even worse.\n",
      "2/10 for this, this movie was extremely slow not engaging and tediously boring, if you want to catchup on some sleep this will work? This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movieI saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves.\n",
      "The idea behind it is not bad. But the realization is completely wrong. The actors seem incredibly incompetent and third-rate, a far cry from Oscar-winning acting. The dialog is flat and boring. The dubbing outside of the original soundtrack makes the whole thing even worse, which is a shame for such a well-rated movie.And to underline the whole thing again... here is the same text again.The idea behind it is not bad. But the realization is completely wrong. The actors seem incredibly incompetent and third-rate, a far cry from Oscar-winning acting. The dialog is flat and boring. The dubbing outside of the original soundtrack makes the whole thing even worse, which is a shame for such a well-rated movie.\n",
      "Story is not digestive..no way around the truth of life..how one family can easily destroy another Happy family..\n",
      "This movie was so boring. So overrated. I admit it - this is not my genre - but even so I do not see why this movie was almost universally critically acclaimed. One good thing about watching this movie - I fell asleep and apparently have sleep apnea so I'm gonna go get that checked and treated. So, there's that. If you like interminable movies with an absurd plot and no movement, then this movie is great. Me personally? I'd rather have a colonoscopy than sit through this movie again.\n",
      "Quite original,but thats all... the Academy made a weird choice this year..a bit disappointed.\n",
      "Boring movie, the acting is fine but there are too many unnecessary scenes and the plot is bland, uninteresting . A waste of time\n",
      "You have seen the ludicrous reviews claiming that this is the best film of the year and that it will be remembered for years. It won't. It's a nonsensical movie about a bunch of weirdos. It's well shot, but if you expect a movie to give you some positive feelings, some lesson, or an inspiration, well prepare to leave the movie theater empty-handed.\n",
      "They all smell the same.It's the semi basement smell or the subway.Point of this movie is - don't get greedy.It doesn't take money to be nice.Who gives a cleaning service all that info ?!?!\n",
      "If the guys sense of smell is so fine tuned ( panties in the car), why can't he smell the food and drink stuffed under his couch 1 foot away from him?\n",
      "I honestly can't understand how this movie won the Best Picture Oscar. I don't know if there was any controversy surrounding its selection, but if there was, I would say it's justified. Forget star ratings, I can gauge how much I enjoy a movie by the number of times I pick up my phone or go get a snack or go to the bathroom without pausing it. I spent a lot of time looking at things on my phone during Parasite.It's a somewhat entertaining movie and it's kind of interesting to see how people live in Korea but it's not believable and certainly not a great movie. The Tarantinoesque bloodbath at the end just makes it even less believable.LIke I said - I don't get it.\n",
      "At a loss to figure out why this film 1) won best picture of the year US Oscars 2) Cannes Palme d'Or. Also at a loss to understand why film categorized as a comedy.There are moments of humor, but they are few and far between. The violence is also unwelcome.On the Oscars award: \"Joker\" is a much stronger candidate. At least the audience has been advised of the violence in advance.Save yourself time, and possibly money. Skip it\n",
      "Not funny, not realistic, and disturbing.I believe the ratings are highly rigged with Korean movie fans who has never seen a good movie!There are thousands of better movies that includes the very same message this movie is trying to give, but better.\n",
      "This movie is surely a masterpiece in testing the viewers' patience, it reflects some usual ambiences going on between two families.Keeping acting apart, this movie really falls short of its greatness. I mean you can win audiences heart by just acting well, there's a need of content to fulfil, without the content you can't even perform, that how it goes with this movie. After seeing many positive reviews, I think that this movie is just a disquieting exception.\n",
      "I became mildly interested in this movie when a student mentioned it in my horror-film class. However, I became skeptical when the film went all mainstream by snagging the Best Picture Oscar.I was right to be hesitant. This movie has some strengths, including its cinematography and stunning musical score, but its story line goes wildly astray in its second half.Here we have the story of an impoverished family of freeloaders who ingratiate themselves into the lives and home of a wealthy family. Just when it looks like they'll get away with their scam, everything is threatened by the return of the family's fired homemaker.At this point, the movie careens into thoroughly unlikely territory that is slightly reminiscent of recent horror movies like \"Get Out\" and \"The Hostel.\" There are indeed moments of high tension, such as when the family has to sneak out of the house when their hosts are sleeping nearby.A Noah's Ark-level rain shower and flood is good for its special effects but does nothing to advance the story.The movie's maudlin ending is the weakest part of the film. By the time the movie reaches its denouement the audience doesn't like what remains of the family and doesn't give a fig about its Morse Code messaging.To me, the ending seemed haphazardly slapped on because the producers didn't know how else to end this work. Anti-climactic to the max!\n",
      "I found \"Parasite\" problematic to watch. The subtitles were often difficult to read and were put on too fast. Some were posted white on a light background. That was hard to read. Subtitles take away from the visual of the film and in this case the visuals of what was happening were paramount.The good part, in my opinion, was the social commentary of the disparity between rich and poor. The difference is extreme. The poor were depicted there living in filth and squalor. The way the poor live in Korea not being able to get jobs is mind numbing. I have read that many in Korea live as the pictured in the film. The film showed effectively social class dichotomy.What happens to the rich when the poor invade their home surreptitiously is ultimately extreme violence. It is nothing short of mayhem especially at the end. Not sure if it would be everyone's cup of tea. I don't think so. Reading the subtitles was difficult and I had to bury my head to avoid watching the violence.I think it should not have gotten best pic? In my opinion the Irishman was gypped in spades.\n",
      "I ki d of liked the movie at that point when I saw the Swiss magnets on the fridge and he started talking about German people living there... I watched the movie with English subs, so I hope in the original language they weren't making this huge fail.\n",
      "Summary: Grade 3 out of 10 for me. He is totally with globalist ideas, class struggle between poor and rich. The people rated it 10 out of 10, saying that the film opens their minds to new perspectives, but if you haven't seen the difference between rich and poor today, you must live on another planet. It depicts the revolt of the poor against the rich in a crude way, in addition they commit crimes and end up returning to a worse life than before. They had to revolt with the government that does not promote any improvement. So I mean, I'm poor and I'm going to go around committing crimes, being a criminal, but against the government I don't do anything? What a disappointment.\n",
      "This movie is barely mediocre. Usually IMDB and my tastes rank spot on, but this is the biggest chasm between our ratings. Terrible people, you don't want to like a single one, boring plot and even worse ending.\n",
      "I don't understand how this movie won the academy award for best picture? Its okay at best..the whole we're trying to make a statement about the rich and poor needing each other to survive is nonsense..these were bad people it had nothing to do with them being poor. If this had been an English speaking film it barely would've gotten a second look...\n",
      "Watched with high expectations, based largely on almost exclusively gushing reviews. It was... ok. To me, nothing special. Perhaps it contains a kernel of greatness which I'm unequipped to get at. In which case it can go and rammit. I'm definitely hearing 'green needle' where the majority (at least of those who have voiced their opinion) are getting 'brainstorm'. While I'm here I'll recommend a Korean film that WAS deserving of its acclaim, Oldboy. See it, or see it again (it rewards repeat viewings). Oldboy is film you can easily fall in love with and sets a benchmark for fantastic cinema - Parasite doesn't come remotely close.\n",
      "Complicated with less meaning. Briefly not what I was expected at all.\n",
      "The movie just doesn't seem to know what genre it is. If you step onto a boat, it doesn't suddenly turn into a submarine or a bus, but this movie does. It starts out so improbable that it's funny, then gets mean, vicious, violent, tragic and depressing. Others have said that it's an allegory about the class differences between the haves and have-nots. My eyeballs roll at this. So what! Life isn't fair. That is no excuse for one-dimensional characters. A family of grifters that is too stupid to succeed at anything somehow manages to cleverly con its way into the lives of a wealthy family. Of course, this must end somehow or there'd be no tension. You know something is going to eventually happen as the unexpected fortune of the poor family cannot continue, but why does it have to end in such gratuitous violence? What kind of person likes watching that? It makes you feel guilty about laughing during the comedic sections earlier in the movie.\n",
      "I liked the first half a little bit and i was hoping the second half will deliver , and nope it's like when you try to cook something nice you get everything ready and start cooking then it comes out bad and you throw it to the trash like this movie exactly 2 hours i will not get back !\n",
      "If this was the best picture of 2020, then it doesn't say much for the rest.It starts off ok, a comedy, but slips into a darker shade of comedy. After about an hour it is getting well into black comedy and the last 20 minutes it becomes a slasher movie.I don't think I have ever watched a film when I have wanted to stop watching with 10 minutes to go.Very unrewarding.\n",
      "Amazing why people love this movie, boring and very poor acting\n",
      "I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Reading the synopsis itty sound good.I had to stop watching with 35 minutes left in the movie.I was incredibly bored. I enjoy slow movies but this was.... I felt my life being wasted.Go watch Annihilation. I saw that recently, that is a good movie.\n",
      "I thought character development was great and pacing. That's about it. A ten year old could figure out the plot twist. I just don't get it. But in all fairness I hated Midsommar more.\n",
      "Just goes to show you most people like dumb shows. Not sure what the hype is. Political\n",
      "Soo so poor direction and Soo many mistakes in this movie , I don't how this movie got an Oscar it's really disappointing.\n",
      "I really don't understand what they see in this movie. It's good at most. It is not an original theme, it is not believable as a story, it is slow and it does not entertain. People are very hypocritical to praise a mediocre work of art so highly. Without any doubt or fear of being wrong, this movie does NOT deserve the academy award.The film has the opportunity to develop stories and is left with superfluous scenes. It tries to tell the injustices that a family of employees receives and, honestly, it fails to move the viewer. I find it extremely strange that so many people have praised a film that is far from innovative. The script is bad, at the very least, it could have told a story ten times better. I'm genuinely surprised at the rave reviews this mediocre movie is getting.\n",
      "Very violent for no reason, there are loads of other movies put there saying the same story in a much better way.\n",
      "While the first part of the movie is quite interesting, the second part is just ridiculous and doesn't make sense at all. It's so obvious the twists happens for the sake of drama, which is so flimsy and laughable that WON'T HAPPEN IN REALITY, yet the critics fail to see that. Someone gives you jobs for your whole family and you cheat him by all means and hit him at his back to retaliate for no reason? It's just ridiculously dumb and stupid. Also the a lot of reviews are pretentious about all its meaning, which is such a joke, the meaning of this movie isn't deep its just complete idiotic, that's it. This is only another cult like the quentin tarantino's films, and a ton of korean movies are better than this trash for a mile, like cold eyes, battle of Incheon, always etc just to name a few.\n",
      "An absolute s**t just like its name!I really don't get the reason of wasting money and time for that masters**t!Thank to all those who helped to make that piece of garbage!\n",
      "To be honest, I am so disappointed! Some of the Korean movies I saw before were good, but the plot of the film was too stiff. The film is so full of class stereotypes that it appears that some plots and people are stupid.\n",
      "This puzzles me to no end. My honest feeling is that the claim to offer some kind of social commentary is a layer of \"respectability varnish\" that serves as an excuse for filmmaker and viewer to indulge in the heavy-handed violence that tickles their fancy, and nobody wants to admit that because, well, their peers (and colleague critics) like it, so it must be good.But then again, this seems so blindingly obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people fall for it. I'm honestly struggling with this: I think being critical and voicing social commentary is good and necessary, but movies like this feel rather as if it's part of the problem. They're ice-cold, de-humanising, disengaging. They make me care less.But then again, maybe I'm just stupid and blind.\n",
      "Parasite is a shockingly overrated film that provides no likeable characters for the audience to root for. If anything, the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of. This can be forgiven, movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride. There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character. I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film. I know I am in the vast minority here, as every other person I have talked to loved the movie, but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie.\n",
      "Parasite was an ok movie, it didn´t deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, a soap opera or a k-drama is better than this movie, what a disappointing.\n",
      "Just like a daytime soap opera for 90 mins then a drama for last 30mins! I want to be entertained for the whole movie ! Big yawn\n",
      "After the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking \"was this scene necessary, What's the point?\" right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me.\n",
      "At this point - and I beg you, if you are not going to read all of my arguments, don't just downvote this so that others won't see it - Parasite has become highly overrated. It has got a lot of stuff going for it in a masterclass manner such as the editing and beautiful production design (as well as just people's curiousity, it being an acclaimed foreign film suddenly sky-rocketing in attention worldwilde). But overall the story is bland. It is extremely unrealistic, especially! at the end.\n",
      "Like, I suspended disbelief with a lot of stuff in this movie to enjoy it, and it's fine, we all do that sometimes. When that certain character was still alive at the end, being able to go out unnoticed by police or really anyone, and understand and perfectly read a huge monologue made by morse codes from a lamp. The amount of just-the-right timing and ignoring common sense in terms of movie logic and even character logic... It's insane. You can suspend disbelief and have a good time, but that is beyond ridiculous. And to be frank, it was unneccesary.\n",
      "The point the movie wanted to come across was already made at the climax, so giving us two long final monologues arguing them again was more than not needed.\n",
      "It's also shallow with its message, and missing the point of having something specific to say. At the end, the message becomes something like \"plans are not good, you'll fail if you're from a low social class either way\". Yet in the beginning, their clear laziness yet cunning way of corrupting the rich family is what got them into this mess. Not that lacking a plan and staying the same (feeding off of others) would've made it better. It's really just that the plan they did make was unbelievably insane and not very long-term sustainable. So, what is the point and message again, and how does it count here? I'm sure you can spend hours yourself coming up with some different things which are taken out of this scene and this scene and make sense, but the movie is just too unclear and too unspecific to really get it across overall as a story. Especially! since the situation these people make up (and weren't even forced into) is not really related to how low class people actually deal with stuff such as their place in opposition to the higher class. There's been cases of this, but it just doesn't fit with the point and have any moral or commonsense value. It seems more than anything than an attempt to make us feel pity for people who were low and somehow got themselves even lower. (Which, making us feel pity succeeds, but please, pity is one weak goal for a story when you leave behind the actual fight to get past it. Then what is the journey? For one, I don't like the Joker comparisons, but in this case the main character in that movie tried to get out of the pity before he became corrupt, hence making a point of the hopelessness; no matter how he did the right thing, he would've ended up like that. This?...)\n",
      "It felt like Suicide Squad writing in the way of moving from one point to another, an explosion here and a twist there, enough to keep you from figuring the whole movie out, but when one sequence is introduced (peach sequence) you quickly figure out that the end of that is going to be the whole family taking over, and these sequences keep happening over the course of the entire movie: *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening* *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening*. And it doesn't make for much organic, fluent storytelling overall, or delivers a message along with it, although the smooth and undeniably masterful editing and rhytm will try and convince you of that.\n",
      "The symbolism is also very in-your face and sometimes outright stupid. The whole going up and down stairs thing to demonstrate class system etc. is cool enough especially watching it as a brilliantly mood-grabbing visual, although obvious (and seriously unavoidable considering it's just how you go down into a basement, and rich people houses usually just live on the higher grounds). Throwing in a rock and leaving the audience to come up with something to say about it is, to me, disrespectful. I've looked up so many interviews with the cast and Bong himself, but they don't seem to know or care about explaining it themselves, they never dig into the actual symbolism, they just go \"here, this is symbolism, it's great right?\" and go to the next thing they love but appear humble about in their movie. A lot of saying that there is symbolism and meaning in everything, yet being very hollow about it, or it's something that is obvious and you'd do in most movies to get a point across. Then I looked up audience interpretations of everything from the rock to the weather and dialogue, and there's nothing mindblowing nor very impressive about it. Especially that rock and what they do with it in the movie, it's just...wow, thanks, makes sense.\n",
      "A lot of people are praising this movie so highly, yet it's a very decent film without anything too much to say, and an unbelievablity factor that's offensive at last. I don't know why people praise it so highly. If it's just the momentum it's been building up. Rated #22 movie of all time over Silence of the Lambs, The Green Mile, The Usual Suspects and a dozen of other classics which put so much more obvious work into their scripts and therefore the solids of their movies? Winning Best Picture *and* Best Director over 1917, a cinematic war piece you'll simply never see at the same level again, and Joker, a movie that was actually clear with its message - that there is a certain hopelessness in class systems no matter how hard you try? It literally makes no sense except for the momentum and everybody downvoting and ignoring anyone who has got anything negative to say about it. Scary stuff.\n",
      "Parasite worked on multiple levels, but to me, the writing simply tore much of that apart. It's very sad that other masterpieces were almost completely or completely ignored at the Oscars, while something like this gets away with not only the biggest prize of them all but also several other big ones (Best Director and even Original Screenplay), when there are major issues in all of those departments.\n",
      "That said, the Oscars are known for doing what it takes to stay relevant and out of too much danger, as well as voting with sometimes anything but commonsense. I hope that in time people will calm down, step down from their high horses and actually take in some of this. And I really hope that some of the other movies which didn't get the same amount of attention and praise at the Oscars, will live on greatly.\n",
      "A sad disappointment. Thank you sincerely if you've read this much. I appreciate it whether or not we've come to the same conclusions.\n",
      "The only good thing I noticed about this movie is how the 180 rule was decently violated when the rich mother was talking to the poor daughter/ art teacher. The use of slow shutter speeds during the pee/ water battle was completely unnecessary. Bloodbath, boom. Nihilist muttering. How did the kid survive being hit twice with that rock? I hated this movie. Didn't get it.\n",
      "Decent acting, not great.\n",
      "Not suspenseful.\n",
      "Not thrilling.\n",
      "Not scary, not even a bit.\n",
      "Decent overall message.\n",
      "Parts seemed overly forced.\n",
      "Too predictable.\n",
      "Only finished watching hoping it would improve, but it did not.\n",
      "Would have enjoyed it more had it been 35 minutes long.\n",
      "2 stars for effort and production.\n",
      "The high ratings are suspicious and puzzling.\n",
      "Let's start with what I saw first:1. Self pity:\n",
      "The whole family, full of adults at this point are sitting in their small, dirty, and cramped apartment begrudgingly and unhappy. What I have a problem with is the father, still healthy and able bodied was not really working hard to provide. Also the children, they were just as sloppy as their parents. Instead of working hard at trying to find a job, the mother wants to argue with her boys, almost losing the only job that's sustaining them for everyone! I mean they complain but honestly they ought to be kicking themselves!2. Unrealistic:\n",
      "Who in their right mind would fire their long time nanny/maid over one weekend they saw her sick without taking to her to see what's going on? I mean you're just asking for your life to just be subject to chance. These people are rich, getting money requires hard work to have a lot of it, you have to have a level of some intelligence. You can't make me believe a whole family could be this gullible! And why would you leave your oldest daughter in the room with a random guy? The details just did not add up to me, coming off as a movie that overlook the details just to make it to the climax as their selling point. This movie was rated higher than Hateful 8, one of my favorite movies, but totally are not on the same playing field, reading wise, I feel like this was a waste of my time. I and my husband both look forward to watching altleast one movie on our relaxing Sundays to get away from the life of busy toddlers and cleaning. What a total let down on movie Sunday 😞.\n",
      "TERRIBLE ! VERY VITIMIZATION! Poor poor people. No living conditions? You will go after studying, working, creating your own living conditions to get out of the hole. They used cheats to fool the rich family. Typical leftist movie that incites violence between poor and rich.\n",
      "Why not incite the union of classes? Why not help yourself by being honest with each other? Showing your strengths and weaknesses? The world is going from bad to worse because of this FAILED ideology.\n",
      "The first of the movie was awesome, but the end is absurd\n",
      "If people are really this starved for quality movies, I am not surprised what with the second-rate retreads Hollywood is doing lately.However, the actors are all surprisingly likeable despite the content and actions.\n",
      "You feel for them and their situation, but at the same time, I feel the director portrays wealthy people in a very unfair light. It really is the immoral ones who are impacting others' lives with their actions, not the wealthy family.Overall this is worth a watch, but it is not worth 8.6 stars. Ridiculous.\n",
      "The storyline here is original and interesting but unfortunately as the movie develops, it gets a bit silly. I'm not sure what the underlying message is, if any. Just a light comedy really I suppose. I certainly can't understand why it would have won the best picture Oscar in 2020.\n",
      "How in God's name this got an Oscar is beyond me. Starts very well as a concept and even holds ones attention for the first hour. After that it becomes simply daft and corny. In fact it becomes pure Kari On. Definitely a big mistake to throw Oscars at it, I'd throw Soy Sauce. Give it a miss.\n",
      "I see this movie get a high rate and has a high hope. At first I though this would be a copycat of Japanese manga with same titles lol. So I watch the trailer and not impress at all. One day my brother play the movie and I though I give it a try. But after the first half hour I suprise is this a high rate movie ?? I can't stand to watch it. I still curious by the rates (but didn't stand to watch it) so read the synopsys with spoiler instead.. And (sorry), at the end I'm thinking isn't this should be categorized as a very low rate comedy-thriller movie? What an exaggerated ratings.\n",
      "Really thats movie winning 4 oscars !\n",
      "Sure u r kidding with me ..\n",
      "Not good at all , the only good thing in this movie was music , any thing else not..\n",
      "There is no story in this .\n",
      "Not happy for seeing this .\n",
      "Prepare for a big letdown if you fall for all the hype on this one-long and slow and extremely pointless and downbeat. Avoid.\n",
      "Some great films have won the best picture Oscar and some not-so-great films. I think this is a candidate for the worst film to win the award in recent decades. If you like comic strip, then take it as that and enjoy it. Have a laugh. Otherwise its utter shallowness and the revelation of how deeply preposterous the acclaim is that has been given to its facile and puerile social commentary made me feel that I had been conned into taking my seat in the cinema.\n",
      "It's a travesty that this won Best Picture over \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.\" Very predictable. I kept waiting for it to turn into a great movie. It didn't.\n",
      "I started watching this but I couldn't finish it. This says something because I am retired and I don't have much to do. Totally appalling characters. Even if there is a story I don't care because I couldn't care less about the characters. I wonder why it got distinctions. Every other Korean film I watched is better than this. In fact some of them were great.\n",
      "This movie won best picture and this proves best picture winners are often times terrible like this movie. Its not funny and is extremely slow and pointless. The last 40 mins is completely different than the first part of the movie. This movie may have been a 5 if it was not for subtitles.\n",
      "Saw this movie today. While well acted and photographed, the story was nothing exceptional. Interesting for a while, yet waiting for something better to happen which never occurred. The last third of the movie turned dark and disturbing not only for the violence but the silly way it ended leaving me shocked at how it won the best picture Oscar. The first thought I had as the final shot ended the movie was:\n",
      "\"Are you kidding me?\" The all time worst choice for best picture ever!!!\n",
      "I don't care much for farce. Farce is a story where all the plot tension comes from a pretense. A quarter of the way into this, it's clear we're in the land of farce. Halfway in, we're bored and restless and merely waiting for the pretense to be caught out.The cinematography is nice. The acting is competent. The struggle of class against class is forever relevant. But it's still farce.\n",
      "I didn't enjoy a single minute of this movie. OK, the plot was interesting, the actors were good, but when ALL of the characters are unpleasant and most of them are a bunch of lazy, nasty parasites I can't have any positive feelings.\n",
      "And it is not about being poor. The characters in Slumdog millionaire were in worse situation, but there was so much more humanity there...\n",
      "Here, I saw an example of a mental cesspool.1917 was my choice.\n",
      "I am really confused by people who call this film \"groundbreaking or a \"masterpiece\". It's a watchable film that takes a while to gain momentum but manages to keep your attention. Nothing earth- shattering or innovative about it. A good experience but I would not pay $14.99 again. I fell victim to the hype.\n",
      "Wow I can't believe the hype. Am I the only one who doesn't like this movie? Considering the awards and the hype I was expecting a master piece or something extremely interesting, entertaining, deep and with a plot twist. None of this happened. The movie is just okay, it didn't have a goal, it's just some random stuff happening just like that. Not to mention that none of the characters were likable and you can't create the bond, respectively you don't care about them. Most of the events looked fixed, unlike other korean movies where the realism was better and the tension was real. Until the end I was expecting some great twist, similar to the Cabin in the Woods for example, but no, it was just a massacre that was actually expected and it got executed poorly and in a naive way. I really just don't get it why is this hype, the movie is ok, sometimes difficult to watch because it's long and slow sometimes, kind of watchable, but definitely not a master piece, far from it. Very overrated in my opinion. The Awards were handed for political reasons I guess.\n",
      "The hype around this film is staggering. As the film unfolded, I predicted all but two of the things that happened. It just seemed like such an obvious stream of events other than the surprise half way through and the Tarantino -Lite ending.There's an almost complete lack of sympathy for, or empathy in, almost all of the selfish, unpleasant characters. Maybe that's the point, but if you want a film where there's someone to root for, this isn't for you.Although you can see the point the film makes writ large from an early stage, it does a poor job of making you think the downtrodden deserve any sympathy.\n",
      "But defintely didn't deserve the best movie award. That should've went to jojo rabbit. There's so many things wrong with this movie. It starts out interesting and then just collapses into things that don't make any sense.\n",
      "It was an OK movie. I don't understand how you can give an Oscar to a movie that's just kind of meh. I was hoping that the ending would be something super interesting or exciting but instead it was just kind of sad. I feel like to call this a masterpiece is an insult. It was a movie it happened and it was two hours long.\n",
      "The entire movie is one long mistake after mistake. The whole is a mistake. Nothing would have happened if every person didn't make every mistake at every possible turn.It started very promising, but turned into a slapstick comedy. Halfway through the movie, everyone just starts doing the most stupid things you can imagine. Let me go down the stairs, even though it stupid. Let's all fall down the stairs like a bunch of loony toon re t ards. When they're holding the phone with the video, lets not punch the phone out of their hand. As they're standing there, lets not punch the woman in the face. When i walk down the stairs, let me drop a 15 kg stone on the floor. Let me then walk around the corner, without looking behind my back. When im being chased with a cord around my neck, let me first of all not stop, and kick the person chasing me up the stairs, but let me also not grab the cord, so i don't get choked to death.It's ruins a movie when the characters are obviously forced to do stupid things in order for a particular plot to happen. You cant take the movies seriously, because it's like it's written by a 5 y/o.Meh out of ten.\n",
      "It does not deserve all the Oscars it has got and its just an averagely done movie. More deserving movies have been left out of oscars just to oppose the government. Such a shame.\n",
      "A overrated movie,plane and simple. They should decide are the oscars about politics or about movies.\n",
      "Not bad but in no way Oscar winning stuff. The smell of the poor is a visceral punctum though.\n",
      "Every single minute of this movie I was wondering why, why, why, would anyone give any credit to such rubbish. How a terrible movie like this would get any praise at all! And I finally got the answer: Political Bleeping Correctness. \"Give an award to the different people even if the movie stinks\"! A criminal con family. Are those the new \"heroes\"? The Shawn of the dead is much better than this. Run fast!\n",
      "So I went in after seeing 10/10s, 5 stars and Oscars/ awards.You know how a celebrity starts a trend and ten years later no one can believe that was fashionable and it actually was horrendous.I get that vibe here, because the film is so unique and Let's the viewer decipher the plot, people are saying this is great because it's thought provoking, similar to a tate modern peice of art, red splash of paint worth 5 million because the artist is famous.Anyway, as you can tell I'm not that keen on the film but didn't hate it, just left confused to the over inflated ratings, reviews and awards. Go in sceptical and you may far better than me.\n",
      "Once again, I find myself questioning 3 things 1) the entertainment industry's media machine which seems to be growing further and further away from 'the people' 2) the willingness of an army of sheep to fall into line and 3) the veracity of many online reviews.The caustic social commentary is irksome and tired, i.e., hardscrabble, noble poor struggle to survive while self-indulgent rich people tread on them. This has been covered in literature and film countless times and often better than this. In this case the poor family are (with the exception of the daughter) listless and dim, not at all sympathetic. The fact they ruin the lives of two people who actually do their jobs is forgivable apparently. In contrast the unlikable rich are in fact a clever entrepreneur and his wife who, though not smart, dotes on her children and wants nothing but the best for them. Not sure why the somehow deserve to be exploited by a family of indolent grifters. And apparently the father's distaste for poor grooming is deserving of homicide. Great.In any case the movie is predictable except where it introduces 'deus ex machina' plot contrivances.The finale is idiotic. The father is desperate to drive his kid to hospital. The car keys are under a dead man's body. While attempting to move the body he notices that the man has body odor and pauses to, in a particularly demonstrative fashion, hold his nose and roll his eyes. Riiiight.Throw in a little bit of tastelessness (really, if you find a pair of panties do you immediately sniff them?) and you've got the makings of a rather tedious and somewhat offensive 2 hours of mediocre movie making.\n",
      "This movie just wasted over two hours of my precious life. I would rather stick cacti in my eyes than re-watch this horrible film. It had an interesting beginning but in the middle of the movie it made me realize that it was going nowhere. On top of that, the ending was just stupid. If you value your life, you won't waste time on this movie.\n",
      "I think the movie is totally overhyped and definitely not worth the 8.6 score. In my opinion there's simply no way you'd score it with anything beyond 6 Stars, let alone prize it with 4 Oscars. Politics... again played a huge role in the Oscars SMH.\n",
      "Politicizing the nomination and the awards is disgusting. This must be stopped immediately.\n",
      "I don't like to read a movie, give me a book. At the very least, an overdub would be better.\n",
      "Just didn't cut if for me, too dark of a story about a family of creepy grifters.\n",
      "I don't know why this movie won Best Picture in 2020.The script is terrible. The story is of a family that scams another. In the middle of the scam they meet other scammers. The conflict unfolds.The film tries to make you identify with the main family. However, there is no one you identify with here.All the characters of the film are detestable.From the pervert Kim Ki-Woo, the murderer Oh Geun-sae and the classists Park Dong-ik and Choi Yeon-gyo. Understanding that everyone around them is equal to them.This is the only equality that is wanted to be achieved and is achieved that I find in Parasite.I don't know what the director's point is here. Show what we already know? That there are social classes? It is a waste of time and does not favor the fight against discrimination. Because this movie doesn't make sense.So why this movie gets 1 star?Basically because of the torrential rain scene. That scene is perfect. The color, the overwhelming atmosphere, and Song Kang-ho's acting just break your heart. Especially when Kim Ki-taek returns to his house.A very well done scene.\n",
      "I finally gave up and watched this movie. There was so much hype around it, I was definitely intrigued.After a careful watch, I think we are in front of a weak movie. From a technical point of view, nothing to say about it: nice craft, beautiful photography. In-house scenes are delightful. The flood scene is perfect. Very interesting camera angles. Nice analogy by putting the poor in the bottom and the rich on top. This is clear when three members of the poor family are leaving the rich family house after the coffee table scene: they are headed home under the rain, and they go down and down and down till they get home. Corporal odor references are clever.My point about this movie is that we don't have a real story here. Instead, it's a social gag. The movie starts very slow and for more than one hour something that should not be possible at all (the poor family becoming a parasite of the rich family) happens in front of us in form of a perfect plan that works as a charm. The pace, though, is very slow and the whole situation is unlikely to say the least.After that, something unexpected happens (the housekeeper re-appears) and the whole story kind of accelerates. Couple of funny things happen, but Bong Joon-Ho looks a little bit lost. The plan, apparently, is to set up everything so we can add the usual ultra violent scene that every movie/tv show needs to capture the audience's attention. The strategy of the poor family moves all of a sudden from perfect to disastrous, the climax scene (fortunately) is short enough so we can easily forget about it and after that even some more weird things happen (the scene in the hospital is almost stupid, so it is the ending). Some characters are over-used (like the rich family mother) and some others are almost forgotten when they are super interesting (the young kid of the rich family), ... Even the sequence order in the second half of the movie is in my opinion wrong.Parasite is not a terrible movie and we live in a society full of people that will enjoy the main metaphor being depicted by Bong Joon-Ho, but by no means we are in front of a masterpiece.\n",
      "Underlining that every taste is different. I just have to say that my experience was too boring, there were even non-sense moments. Like every bad movie.\n",
      "I just cannot understand the reason for such a high rating this movie has got. It is a less than ordinary movie.\n",
      "A family getting employment using fraud means and in the process kicking out the honest ones. No laughing matter.\n",
      "And the violence they unleash to stop getting exposed, is hard to comprehend.\n",
      "The old housekeeper is killed mercilessly by this family to protect themselves.\n",
      "And in the end, when one of them kills his own employer, whatever the reasoning..it spoilt to all.\n",
      "The second half and esp the end are horrible. The movie made no sense.\n",
      "Kill them all. This is the motto of this movie. It does not deserve any oscar or palm. It is unsubtle, not funny, not interesting. Sorry for the suspense bit as we talk masterpiece and cinema history , let's skip the suspense and talk about the movie. I did not like it at all until the end, but the end is beyond.So the rich boss, who is rather kind and nice, deserves to die because he does not like the garbage smell of his driver. I guess we are a lot who deserve to die, probably starting with the director and actors who may be accustomed to some comfort.I definitely despise this kind of black or white movie, with a message.\n",
      "I do not like the Korean films, I do not think that they are as transcendental or innovative, much less films that remain in the memory of the viewer as the American ones of the past and I think that people only see them because of the crisis that Hollywood is going through. Sorry my bad english.\n",
      "While I understand that I like movies that are prob not on the best picture stage, I give all movies a chance. I heard a lot about this and was curious so my husband and I rented. I was forever waiting for it to get interesting and the thriller to come out but it never did. I was surprisingly not distracted by the subtitles but although a fun interesting movie, I don't see where the best picture came in. If you're bored or call in sick one day I'd say give it a watch but I wouldn't rave about this.\n",
      "I must be odd man out. I saw the humor the gore the deceit the regrets, just didn't add up for me. Just weird\n",
      "Pros: A very good, interesting, 1st half, and fantastic cinematography.Cons: Descends to unintentional farce in 2nd half. Plus entire premise of movie is flawed, as South Korea is a thriving economy. The family is intelligent, presentable, makes zero sense that their only option would be folding pizza boxes. Esp the son, as he knows English he'd be in high demand.The family was so clever In setting themselves up in the luxury house. But then why did suddenly turn dumb, by not realizing the rich family's camping trip would obviously be cancelled in that huge storm, and by letting the former maid in to have the run of the place? The idea of that guy living in the basement was just stupid, and esp that the father suddenly turns into a murderer. And what's with that undoing thing about the family smelling bad? They knew enough how to get over on the rich folks, but didn't know it's a good idea to use soap and deodorant ?Obviously Park's wanting to make some big point about unjust income inequality, but points like that are better made by not using dumb and ridiculous situations, and a main premise that makes no sense.\n",
      "I often watch Korean movies, and they do have a style that is proper to them. I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art.\n",
      "This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry ... even got an Oscar ; by watching the cover and the title, i didn't want to watch this movie. But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie.\n",
      "To me, i didn't find the \"humour\" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour).\n",
      "The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like \"Parasite\").\n",
      "The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy.\n",
      "All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped.\n",
      "I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois.\n",
      "I usually don't put in negative reviews but omg this was sooooo bad. 😑😑 bored out of my mind\n",
      "The Korean version is more dramatic and have a cinematic feel to it. the script was fined tune and fused with universal themes that may also won it an Oscar.\n",
      "There are some movies that move slowly and this is necessary for the subject, the tone of the film, the development of the characters and the story. This is not one of them. The biggest problem ist the first part, when the destitute family, person per person, starts to work for the rich family and as in most social dramas, the differences of living and working are shown. This takes one long hour. I guess the intention was to film it in a comedic way and it is clear from the beginning that there will be changes. Unfortunately this hour is just very boring and not at all funny. I had to stop watching and resume on another day. If this part would have been condensed to 20 minutes - fine. After the first hour things change in tone and the expectation that the already established critique of social differences in the country (and the one solution of maybe marrying up, which stays a dream) will be dealt with more openly are confirmed. The only surprising element is the how - the very fast developing escalation of violence. At the end we again see the dream of the boy to make money, climb the social ladder and rescue his father - which of course will stay a dream. So the three parts of the movie are very conventional, but they don't work together very well.\n",
      "Just wondering why it's highly rated. The story is weak and it's another ordinary story. Maybe because it's Korean.\n",
      "I believe the Founder movie is away better.\n",
      "I have no idea why people are so hyped about this movie. Poor family was shown as people who doesn't have any values/character, greedy and ready to do whatever it takes even to the people who are nice to them or the ones who are struggling as them. I found it wrong completely.\n",
      "The movie was kind of original on the history, but feels pretty slow. I cant understand the hype, maybe the exotics of the culture and the neccesity of the academy to achieve more diversity. No such a great movie as other said.\n",
      "To all of you with the high rating - You liked the house didn't you!? be honest - it was the architecture, wasn't it?Can't be the amateurish overacting...\n",
      "First half was ok- acceptable. Second half full of farfetched storylines and violence.\n",
      "It's a beautiful film, but it says nothing about class struggles and upward mobility that hasn't already been covered. I say this from a Western perspective, so I cannot speak to how the film was felt in South Korea. But as a Black American, I was... bored? I think the film's resonation with White American audiences speaks to this point even more. It won the Oscar because it is a criticism of Korea, not of America. We sit at a safe distance and revel in the \"bravery\" of the film because it allows us to ignore our own flaws. It is by no means a bad film. Just not a particularly interesting one.\n",
      "Really overhyped and overrated. The movie is OK but far from \"best of the decade\" to be honest. When watching the movie I felt that I was always 2 or 3 seconds ahead of the plot, which (especially the first half) vibes like that of a cliche sitcom show, squeezed and polished (really hard) into an \"artsy\" crowd-pleasing movie. This whole unprecedented praise around the movie, which I guess I will never understand, somehow reminds me of the fanatics about Kpop, which, (un)surprisingly, shares the initial \"K\".\n",
      "Not worth the oscar material. Not a must watch. A normal film. Highly overrated.\n",
      "When comparing and competing against other movies on a world wide scale, it falls quite short. Stereotypical and to be honest I'm getting sick of movies coming out of Asia that portray the upper class in the exact same style. The story never captured me throughout the whole movie. Sorry but other foreign movies this year deserved the awards.\n",
      "I like movies that start normal and small actions add up to twists and drama later but in this movie it was everything very predictable. Nothing new. They're just a poor family that starts lying their way out of poverty. By the way it seems unbelievable that they would be such good actors and so coordinated with each-other. The next obvious thing is that the truth will leak somewhere and I kept hoping for some genius way for it to unfold. But it didn't.\n",
      "It had many great moments such as the little guy being a genius or when the house was drown in sewage water but none of those moments developed further or had anything to do with the story.\n",
      "I kept waiting for a twist but all I got was a hot mess. Maybe the twist would be if the nice rich people would turn out to be not so nice and naive; or a strange collaboration to happen between the family and the poor couple.\n",
      "I know that most of the things that happened have a symbolic meaning that try to convey the differences between the rich and the poor but they didn't have a good logical excuse to happen the way they did.\n",
      "I don't like this movie not because I hate subtitles, am racist or bigoted, but simply because I don't regard this movie as that good.\n",
      "This movie is full of plot holes, especially on the second half. The supposed twist is full of stupidity and the ending can not be worst than that. Really dont understand how can this win the Oscar.\n",
      "Not new. The feeling brought by the movie is so normal. Coming from a 3rd world country, this is understandably not a hype for me. I guess the strong impact made by this overhyped movie is applicable to to those 1st world countries only.\n",
      "... that his movie was not for me. But i can see how this is my problem and not the problem of the movie. I love immersion and the movie did nothing to immerse me in any way.But who am I to judge? I don't know anything about cinema, I only watch movies for entertainment. And this was just not entertaining for me.\n",
      "I think it was a film director who said that fiction is asked to make sense, when reality often doesn't. This film must be very real because it is absolutely senseless. Where does the parasite family get the fancy clothes and the cultured and educated ways? Where do they learn, from one day to the next, to behave like refined people? How do they foresee the reactions of the parasite victims to the millimeter and not fail in their plan? Wait, by the way... where does the plan come from? The plan is never created, never plotted, simply the sister takes off her panties (by the way, a hundred dollar panties) in the car and everything is already organized and everyone agrees. That's nonsense to me. There is only one thread, which must have seemed interesting to the writer, which is the smell, but then nobody pulls that thread and it gets lost. Everyone already knew that rich people are stupid. Why make a whole movie just about this? It reminds me of those movies from the 1940s where the woman protagonist to fool someone only had to dress in men's clothes, hide her hair and put on a false moustache. I think that globally people's credulity is at an all-time low and all those who consider it a masterpiece should start reviewing Cantinflas' filmography. They would find several films in it with themes very similar to this one.\n",
      "This movie lacks depth, nuance, and completely misses the mark when it comes to emotionally impacting its audience. I'm baffled how this film has won so many awards as it doesn't draw one in to really care about what is being shown. It's silly, shallow, and makes for an okay horror flick but if you're looking to learn something, be moved or gain new perspective I suggest just reading the newspaper instead.\n",
      "It's in a foreign language they should add subtitles to the top of the screen instead of the bottom so that way you can read it and watch it at the same time\n",
      "Very bad.\n",
      "The picture is overrated by critics. Does not contain a story. Only an aversion to the main characters.\n",
      "How in the world did this movie receive an Academy award? I absolutely hated it. They did such a disservice to the lower class making the whole family a bunch of grifters, liars and basically thieves. This movie was too long and I would never recommend it.\n",
      "Can't see the hype. Totally overrated. I predicted the plot all the way through. I knew the cleaning lady would return, I knew for sure the family would return, and I knew there was someone in the bunker. And that is like the meat of the story. So, I was bored. 4/10 for being below average.\n",
      "Cultural story line was interesting, funny. bizarre. Not sure how to say much that has not already been said.I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not wasted over 2 hours that would have been better spent digging for worms to fish with or eating a bowl of frosted flakes with bananas and strawberries (which would have been more appetizing).90 minutes would have done it for me....make that 45 minutes. Way too much hype for a theatrical mess. Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year, ha.Just goes to show the Academy is screwed up. This film does not stand in the same arena with movies like 1917 or Harriet.\n",
      "Mother in 2009 is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie was weak with a terrible & predictable ending. It only won an Oscar the downward slide of Hollywoods unoriginality\n",
      "I heard glowing reviews about this movie and decided to watch it. I was expecting to be wowed, but was left disappointed. There are way too many plot holes in the movie. The Kim family is a poor family living in a small basement apartment and yet Mr. Kim is able to drive a Mr. Park's Mercedes Benz with ease and grace without any proper driver training or prior experience in handling luxury vehicles. he had to visit a dealership to check out its controls before taking up the job. Mr's Kim who also has no prior experience as a house keeper, appears to be acing her job. The same goes for the Kids too, they simply ace at their fake jobs.Not to mention the thankless nature of Mr.Kim, who instead of being thankful to Mr. Park for having employed his entire family, ends up killing Mr.Park. This movie certainly did no deserve an Oscar for best picture.\n",
      "This movie was well written, well acted, and the theme (the have's & have not's, & what they do for personal gain and how to keep it) was, indeed, vividly executed. I'm just regretful that it spent so much time on the dark sides of human nature. It's my own fault for sticking with it to the bitter end, but can you blame me? It's a pandemic, for crissake! I've already watched all the movies that actually make me feel good about the human race. This just isn't one of those.\n",
      "This is the most fu*ked up movie I have seen in a long time. I thought the idea was exciting and the beginning was a bit of fun. But it got more and more crazy, I felt sick in the end. just wanted it to end. But I understand why some would like it.\n",
      "Well, I guess I am just a consumer who doesn't know movies but I thought this was a bow wow. Unrealistic, too many subplots and little respect for cause and effect. Take for example the flood, the next day they were all dressed like Jeff Bezos in pressed and clean clothes. If you saw the scene of the flood - no way! Not that it matters but the movie portrayed the actors as people I hope to never meet. Maybe the older housekeeper I would like and her husband. Do you believe the underground setting as even close to something that is really, not me.I was impressed with the visuals of the movie. Nice angle shots and perspectives. Good framing and all the yada yada stuff you should expect from films these days.I just don't see this as a stellar movie. I also did not like the feeling it left me with for South Koreans, yes it is a movie and I hope it only represents a portion of the people in this country but this could really be an issue. If this movie represents only a small portion of the people, what is the relevance, if this type of culture is pervasive enough to make a movie which \"meaning\" then there is an issue with this society in my opinion. I hope it is just a shock and awe movie in a format to surprise people, draw them to the theatre or dare I say the streaming services. After all Friedrich Nietzsche is gone and maybe this movie stands in for him, wouldn't that be good. The movie Nietzsche would make - see it now!.I hope the South Koreans are not really like this. Oh by the way, nice house except the dungeon. After the awards I am surprised the number of people who in general conversation mentioned they turned the movie off part way through. Maybe the ying and the yang of what constitutes quality and how we view societal relationships is the real discussion here and the perspective we all bring.I have to say it made me think but after all said and done as a movie did not fulfill what I had heard and I did not really care for it. Watch this movie, you may really like it, happy for you.\n",
      "So much overrated\n",
      "This movie doesn't worth more than 5 stars\n",
      "I don't understand people who liked it , it has nothing to do with dark comedy , its all boring.\n",
      "This is a real bad movie. Nothing makes sense. There is no strong story or something to focus on. Its a waste of time !\n",
      "I found the plot corny, especially the 2nd half from when they let the old housekeeper back in the housef or whatever reasonI couldn't watch the entire film, thought all aspects amateurish. Lost interest half way.After watching Joker and 1917 I thought this film must be darn good to get best picture.So disappointed.\n",
      "I gave initially 7 stars, but I changed it to 4. Why? It's not close to get even 1 Oscar. 7 stars was for a little sympathy for the Korean films. But getting undeserved 5 Oscar's has let me lose all the sympathy for this film. A Bollywood kind ending was terrible enough. The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences. I'm very disappointed in the Academy Awards. There has been many good foreigner films in last decade and non has won any decent prize.\n",
      "Since Hollywood is hosting the Oscars , they have different categories ; ie such as foreign film. Now that is the field this should have been in , and only that.\n",
      "Since The Oscar is intended for the USA not the world. Hollywood needs to rethink giving away the farm.\n",
      "Case in point Slumdog Millionaire , stole the Oscar from Benjamin Button\n",
      "likely because of a sense of pity.\n",
      "As for this film , it was ok , not spectacular , subtitles were annoying.\n",
      "Likely won't be seen much, due to lack of interest.\n",
      "Incredible that this movie can get such high ratings.\n",
      "Will not recommend watching it. Completely unlikely plot and quite bad acting.\n",
      "When I watched this film, I'll admit, perhaps my mouth twinged at the corners a few times (more so than most other films declaring themselves to be \"comedy\" which I rate one star on average). But this film is mere tripe, it pales in comparison to the refinement, depth and complexity of the popular Adult Swim show, \"Richard and Mortimer\" (Rick and Morty for lower IQ individuals). In fact, the part in particular that has utterly taken my fancy is an episode wherein the titular \"Richard\" transforms himself into none other than a lacto-fermented cucumber, and proudly proclaims his new designation to be \"Pickle Rick\"! Oh how I laughed, for this is true comedy, this is art. This film simply fails to compare to its better, and while I consider it above average as far as modern comedic films go, I simply cannot rate it higher than 4 stars. This is probably due to my incredibly high IQ. My name is Jeurel Barton, bury me with dislikes if you disagree\n",
      "If you like this movie, you have a sick taste. Literally. You light laugh and be surprised during the movie, sure, but the \"message\" in this movie is given to you in the first three minutes. Poor people are evil leaches trying to lure the rich. What a fantastic message. And this film was given four Oscars? Laughable.\n",
      "So to me, the movie was really average. It failed to really grab my attention and keep me on the edge of my seat. The story was also really predictable. I'm not saying it was bad, but it just didn't appeal to me as other movies of this genre.\n",
      "In my country we come across these types of scenarios all the time about the less fortunate families and what they have to do to survive etc so maybe to me the story wasn't so out of the ordinary and I've seen worse on the news.\n",
      "I understand it was really deep and metaphorical, but it just failed to resonate.\n",
      "First half of movie is good but other half is down hill just ok and Oscar wasted on such medicore movie\n",
      "So the super smart members of a poor family (why don't they get real jobs?) take advantage of the gullibility and kindness of a successful rich family to take jobs in the rich family's home (getting other people fired to do it) and then abuse that kindness...with a totally stupid ending...and this is supposed to be a statement against capitalism? How this trash won the Oscar when there were so many good nominations that year is a mystery.\n",
      "I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste too much time on this one. It's okay. No more no less. Okay to watch on a rainy Sunday, as I did, but at no point did it impress. It was quite boring at times although I did finish it with some effort. It's not a bad film but one thing is absolutely clear: it's unworthy of it's Best Movie Oscar! Don't know what the academy was thinking, but this is clueless..\n",
      "Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics.Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact.The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible.He will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's \"Joy House\" (aka \"The Cage of Love\") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons.Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre.Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the \"contribution\" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism \"The Revenant\"), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year.\n",
      "Went and saw the film in a theater after it was re-released because of the Oscar win. And....like many reviewers here, I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood. It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over \"Bread And Chocolate\" (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try \"Ugly, Dirty and Bad\", 1976, for great fun!). I don't think i will remember Parasite in 3 days.\n",
      "Good for a single watch but doesn't deserve Oscar. Very very ordinary story but nicely executed. Worth watch one time\n",
      "Too bad the story couldn't keep up, a bunch of randos with no higher education suddenly become a family of professional grifters and fool this rich family. Ok, over night perfect Family of criminals...on that topic the poor family was awful, not a redeeming action among that wasn't ultimately self serving. The rich family were just victims, the existed merely to move the story along. What happen to the poor boy!!?? Idgaf about the poor family at this point, they deserve any bad fortune they are subjected to. The Parks seemed like caring parents to they're maladjusted children, they're just regular messed up kids. The other family is just irredeemable, the son made out with the under age daughter ...wtf! The ending was the absolute worst, a letter to no one...and he's just going to live in someone else's house? I've not even touched on the people in the basement first ...WTF!In the end, disappointment, I'm so glad I didn't pay money for this.\n",
      "This film was like Jean Genet's The Maids, but uninteresting. The filth that the lower class lived in was extreme, dirty sewage water juxtaposed with upper middle class cleanliness. I don't know why Bong Hoon said Kurosawa was an influence. His film was excessively violent. The murder scene at the birthday party was treated comically but depended on serious commentary. The characters were crass, which says a lot about the director.\n",
      "Lots of high scoring reviews on here and the 8.5 average made me give it a go.I'm not knocking anyone who scored it either high or low but I didn't like it and found it a bit boring in the middle. As for messages I couldn't pick up any message beyond. 'Don't cook the goose that laid the golden egg'\n",
      "Brilliant first half. The character building, the interpersonal relations, and the little scheme of the family was more than enough. Then, the second half they turn to over-the-top dramatics, plot twists and drizzle on some moral preaching at the end. The movie could have been just as great without it, simply because the casting, writing, and development in the first half was incredible.\n",
      "Besides the storyline, all other aspects in this movie including actings, cinematography are good.. but for all the hype I thought it has a clever storyline.. but its not.. the development of the story depends on one silly mistake.. which for me a sign of a weak plot..How could the whole family which could not even fold the pizza boxes properly could suddenly be shown as so good in what they do? And if they are really that good how come they could not get proper jobs at other places all these while?And does the movie tries to tell us how selfish the rich people are and we should be emphatic to the poor?.. I did not get that at all.. its just a simple message that if you're a bad person, you're a bad person no matter whether you're rich or poor.. because its so obvious kim's family are greedy, selfish immoral people too..\n",
      "It's completely unclear why you would kill two (even three) characters. By the end of the story, it becomes \"farfetched.\"\n",
      "I really unable to understand what make people think that this movie is a masterpiece , for me it's par average movie nothing new or not much emotional , I think people who says masterpiece must be watching an ultra level violence movies throughout there life so a small touch made them feel great or they just appreciating as it won academy awards .Any how this is just a normal movie filled with nominal emotional in itThis movie definetly doesn't deserve academy award.\n",
      "I heard a lot about this movie as one of the best. So I decided to watch it in 2022. Who says it's a masterpiece ? Production team ? South Koreans ? USA ? Far from it dear. It has a serious flaw in its content that motivated me to write an honest review about it.Parasite is a film, that shows the power of capitalism, both good and bad. It's a film about capitalism as a whole. That explains why even Obama praised it as well as a lot of Americans too. But I felt that negative aspect of capitalism was not that strongly depicted, instead glorified the happiness that comes from capital philosophy. It is a film that showed the poor are liars, the opportunist, the crooked, the dirty people with dirty smell and so on. The movie showed that rich were honest, sacrificing and decent guys of the world. It is heavily biased in economic perspectives. I think sometimes, was it funded by USA or a dealed under the table film by any means ?The story goes as - the taek's family infiltrates park's family due to greed, clashes with the Park's due to economic differences. It is followed by jealousy, frustrations and violence all erupted together through various circumstances leading to murder. And finally the poor takes some desperate measures to own the rich goods. It meant poor are bad and should be viewed as parasite in society. How rude, sadistic and wrong messages did the director gave the world ?? Bong Jong Hoo, are you sleeping ?This is a serious flaw in the film, which couldn't be ignored because it's not a fantasy film, rather a drama showing real life characters with real appeals. Technically the film is good, well built subplots upto the brilliant sex scene, with a major flaw in the second half. That's where the story goes off-track and turns something unlikable. The 2nd half almost dragged my mind to below zero. Nothing was making sense but still....Parasites are those who feed on others, but Mr Bong didn't thought that issue with a clear mind. He roughly saw poor feed upon rich and so are parasites. But instead parasites are those who resides within the higher and lower strata and everywhere around us. That should have been the message, my dear Mr Bong Jong Ho. You have perverted the moral message of accepting, forgiving and loving the poor. A very perverted movie, but nonetheless a movie. And the film won an Oscar ??? Now I understood about the awards.Avoid this movie due to its ability to make you a hardline materialistic person and pervert your thoughts. It deserves 1/100 but I give it a 36/100, due to Mr Bong's seniority and also he belongs to South Korea, an Asian. A straight 4/10.\n",
      "The first half hour is promising. Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult.\n",
      "Was it a good movie, meh. Was it a bad movie? No, but certainly not a Oscar worthy movie if you ask me. Te first 30 minutes of the movie are really good, but after the 30 minutes it starts to become a awkward movie with a strange twist. I do like a good twist in a movie but this became just to strange that it didn't make any sense anymore.\n",
      "This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED.\n",
      "just don't understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard.\n",
      "People who're praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed.\n",
      "There is really nothing special in this movie that stands out.\n",

      "This is one of those Movies that are very promissing - it all starts very well with all the characters being portrayed very well - the whole premise i drawn out - but sadly when directors / Scriptwriters don't know how to end af story they do what they do in this movie - and its totally hopeless - its the sort of ending af 12 year old would come up with cause they cant selve there story - i really wish this had been so much better - but it isn't - my son who loves film - and really love the most of the movie - were angry at the end cause he felt betrayed by the director/movie - and i totally understand him - its just not a very good film. Alle he best though. Love.\n",

      "For no reason at all, during the second half, the comedy is completely gone and the movie becomes a sociopathic nightmare. Everybody starts killing everybody with no reason, without any sense and with extreme violence and graphic gore.\n",
      "WTF???\n",
      "Why did they abandon a good comedy? Could they really not find a good finish? What is the point?\n",
      "I have lost any faith I still had for the Oscars. We know they are half political. But best movie of the year? The movie is quite bad. So why did they give it so many prizes? Because it shows a social separation and those movies always win big prizes for some reason. Do the Oscars judges feel a social obligation? Does it make them sleep better at night? Are their lives so miserable that they need to smile on the less fortunate for a false sense of altruism? Or is The president afraid of Corea?\n",

      "Good film but not an oscar... or not should be an oscar!\n",
      "Visually it was amazing, a korean film with international appeal made it fun to see.. but thats it! I was expecting a deep dive psychological thriller and got confused along the way with the message it was trying to relay to the viewer... how can others say this was some deep discussion on class differences when the poor cant fold boxes, are con artists and liars, and the rich are a well off family that work hard and care for each other, whose only crime was having a bad smell problem... its not riveting, its weak. There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities. This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for, rich or poor... who are you supposed to root for? Definitely not the poor con artists, and if thats done on purpose it shows a tremendous pretentiousness.\n",
      "Its an average well done movie, receiving high praise because it was korean made... ive seen better in the last 10 years.\n",
      "By all means, watch it though.\n",
      "II don't like the characters. It doesn't move me. It's cold but not cold in a good way. I don't know what the message is. Just becuase it's an unfair class society you can act like an ***hole? The ending is silly. The characters revolting. It's an empty film an dthe rave reviwes are foolish.\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend the movie to literally noone.It was simply a 4 in my books, a 5 at most, but definitely not 7 or 8 IMDB points type of movie.\n",
      "It is amazing to me how often you see folks review films and they get caught up in the hype that some people say how great a movie is and then they feel they have to say the same thing. Not me. The movie was aesthetically beautiful and shot in a way that I have not seen before. However, the premise is preposterous. The rich family were very rich and somewhat naive, but on the whole they were nice people. The mom doted on her kids and wanted the very best for them even if she did not always understand them. The father worked long and hard hours but appeared to always come home. They treated all four of the folks they hired to help as almost family. And the movie made a point about identifying the supposed insults that the rich family made about the poor family but the \"insults\" were not particularly harsh. But I guess we were supposed to hate the \"evil rich family\". Meanwhile the poor family got an innocent driver fired. Caused the existing housekeeper to suffer a severe allergy attack several times and invaded and jacked up the rich family's house when the family was away.It wasn't a movie depicting the differences between the ultra rich and the ultra poor. It was a movie identifying the differences between an idiot family and a successful family who got rich.\n",
      "I've never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film. It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago.Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes.It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie.\n",
      "Absolutely nothing special about this movie! But go ahead and have a look!\n",
      "Korean satire about class differences turns into working class slapstick and pointless violence, that is, pointless relative to the point of the satire. The underlying dynamic is contemptuous of the poor and working class, and ends with a phony working class dream, under the guise of family. The last half or so of the film drags.\n",
      "I cant understand why this movie, won the oscar. A boring film with nothing interest. A hysterical plot and a naive scenario...\n",
      "I don't like the movie It is kinda boating u will really not enjoy watching this\n",
      "Are u serious? This movie not deserve the best movie oscar. I think \" oscar goes to 1917 \"..\n",
      "Movie tells as a story about a perfectly hard-working family, that manages to get above the usual poorness in the country.Yet somehow some poor family manages to sneak in their lifes and make them miserable.So what is the conclusion?Was it ?Don't kill people, just because they are rich?Rich people are bad, because they managed to become rich through their hard work?Pointless movie with a political Oscar to support Korea.Story is good to kill some evening, nothing more.No real touching moments, because the drama that happened it the movie was inflicted by stupidness, nothing more.The villains here are the poor people, which is an absurd story, but that is the the movie.\n",
      "Im still figuring out why the viewers are making a big deal of this movie? Just to be fair the oscars award granted for the movie are deserved and all credits goes to directing and screen play otherwise everything was pretty much expectable and crystal clear , plot twists are meh and the whole movie was a slow burn, really it's not that much well scripted.\n",
      "The idea of parasites was good but how they built the drama was totally rushed. They just wanted to jump right into the intense ironical situations of the parasite family so bad that they forgot building a strong opening. Like how on earth can amateurs play professional roles that easily? That was totally nonsense. A seasoned businessman can't realise something wrong with his driver who fakes years of experience after talking with him (for days)? Of course they can learn but the way they turned the daddy into a skillful driver overnight was insane. Also his boy and girl who plays perfectly those roles of intellectuals made it look impractically easy. Come on, the topic was potential and the directior's talent was on point some times but this was absolutely rushed. Too dramatic and not practical enough. It needs remaking on another level as the topic is worth it.\n",
      "I watched this movie during the 3 days, with pauses. It exhausted me really. Such a pain in the ***. It is nothing more than a pale copy of Tarantino's movies, with a plot so unrealistic and boring. The acting was awful too. The only decent things about this movie was a solid camera and photography, as well as the scenography. I really cannot understand all the fuss, the hype and Oscars won.\n",
      "The movie has a very nice direction throughout, it however gives a wrong message to society. The Park family was not doing any wrong to kim family , they have earned money by their hardwork and luck.\n",
      "The kim family did all wrong means to enter the house and slowly slowly they became careless of their responsibility. Mr Park and his wife were decent people, but the movie did not talk about it, rather it tries to justify the murder of Mr Park by Kim family.\n",
      "Totaly Overated. Not my taste, cause boring as Hell. If you don't like it in the first 20 Minutes.. just dont watch further more. It will not get better.\n",
      "Did not like The movie, and did not understand why it was on The Oscars\n",
      "Crap.\n",
      "Talk about SLOW! This movie dragged for me and failed to keep me interested. I ended up turning it off after 20 minutes (surprised I made it that far). I read the synopsis off Wikipedia instead to see what the hype was about. I suggest y'all do the same. Not worth the 2 hours when you can read the synopsis in less than 5 minutes.\n",
      "Nice build up to a powerful educational message that bursts into a Grotesque none sense resolution. The characters decisions make no sense. Absurd it won best film oscar\n",
      "It's not interesting. The director's excessive force has some emotions that cannot be expressed.\n",
      "The history is fine, but why does it have an disaster ending?\n",
      "I was really excited to watch this movie. When I started watching I was very disappointed that there were subtitles. It's hard for me to really view The characters and action While trying to read subtitles. Hopefully one day It will be dubbed in English. I know that my take a way from the movie for many but it makes a lot easier for me to enjoy it even if the lips aren't synced perfectly to the words. If they can sync English to old movies like Godzilla and Mothra they can certainly sync English to this movie.\n",
      "\"Parasite\" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends genres to deliver a thought-provoking and socially relevant narrative. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable, crafting a visually stunning and emotionally charged film. The performances, particularly by the ensemble cast, are exceptional, capturing the nuances of class struggle with depth and authenticity. The film's dark humor adds a layer of complexity, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The meticulously designed sets and cinematography enhance the storytelling, creating a palpable atmosphere. \"Parasite\" challenges societal norms and explores the consequences of economic disparity in a compelling and unpredictable manner. It's a riveting exploration of the human condition that lingers in the mind, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic.\n",
      "I don't know why this movie got Oscar, seriously movie has incomplete story and weak story. Director didn't use the concept properly and sone parts of movie ar still mystery. Very poor direction.Thriller part come at Last and it's also not interesting. This movie can be good if they use concept properly with proper direction. In starting face it's story is very predictable. I don't know why Oscar selector choose this movie. This movie is not eligible for nominations. I literally don't have trust on Oscar after this movie. Can't believe that it's IMDb rating is 8.6. Weak story and poor direction can't win Oscar.\n",

      "I hated the film did not get the plot. I have seen many foreign films, from the amazing Amour in French to the great Spirited AwayI hated the plot. Like the Kim family lied and cheated. Once I can sort of understand as a favour for tutor. But they poisoned the paid . They faked crimes to get what they wanted. Like who does this?I thought the movie would be about how the rich take advantage of the poor. And the rich family would be bad. I say this as a person who went to a private school. And yes i know rich people are bad. But for the sake of the movie it would work.But they ended up destroying and killing the poor. Like what?Also the rich family Park family were very nice people , very naive and not street smart. But nice. Insane thing to do to a human been\n",
      "I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers came from but this is definitely not a fantastic movie. The characters seem stereotyped and lacking depth. I tried, I often go to see movies that don't fit the box office genre but in my opinion, this year's award was looking for one of this genre, rather than it being a top movie deserving an award.\n",
      "Well, I'm shocked by other people's perception that for some reason this is a great movie. It's okay...weird, strange, far-fetched, unusual, but not the best movie of 2020. Same goes for Jojo Rabbit.I recently saw 1917 and it is by far superior and my favorite so far this year. Ford v Ferrari and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were also quite good. Have not yet seen Joker, The Irishman, Little Women and Marriage Story, but will.\n",

      "Waste of night for me\n",
      "This movie started out wonderfully and had the potential to rival films such as \"Arsenic and Old Lace\".The first part of the movie was set up to deliver more satisfying plot twists. Unfortunately after developing the characters and plot it fell all over itself trying to make a statement on the rich and poor. my message to the writers and director, tell a story, make a point , and please entertain and enlighten us. Don't get weird.\n",
      "If you like to watch movies for escapism and finding entertainment and optimism then don't watch this. I can't say it's poorly made, acted, or written, but I couldn't relate or care about anyone in the movie or anything that was going on.\n",

      "In general, what does a parasite mean a living thing, which leaves inside a host. And get its food at.the expense.of its host(which indirectly harms them).but in them movie they never robbed the rich instead they worked there , and at the last it sucks wtf is director telling trying to intellectual but not succeeding ... wtf.And also they way he portrayed the rich and poor was nonsensical . This movie does'nt deserve the word \"masterpiece\" .Sorry, it's an ignorant view of world . For the people who call this masterpiece , you know what masterpiece movies are like , example( fightclub, interstellar, inception, tenet etc)....\n",
      "This movie was well acted, with a unquie plot. It included pieces of well done comedy but should be considered more like a drama. The characters were believable up till they were impersonating roles that were unfamilar to them. But the movie would have done well to end at the halfway point when the house owners returned. It could have had a nice wrap up while illuminating the theme of the story. However the writer went off the deep end and turned it into a slasher movie , which I did not appreciate and felt that it greatly detracted from the movie's theme.\n",
      "I like it. the ending is unexpected and cool. it give me different view on the struggle that rich and poor people face in this world.\n",
      "The brutal and violent film about awful, greedy, evil people. Academy Award for BEST PICTURE ? B**ch please. Should have been nominated for best international if so. Winner just for the sake of inclusivity - try to change my mind.Overall, misunderstanding. Nothing artistic about it. Nothing beautiful about it. A film about parasites - all the leading actors, all that insane and disgraceful family. Didn't enjoy at all it made me angry instead. Oscars have fallen completely with THIS as the main winner. U gotta be kidding me. 1/10, as I couldn't give any less. Oscar winner, this one ? Big mistake. HUGE.\n",
      "I loke the movie, but i hated the actors.. and i don't think this movie deserves the Oscars\n",

      "I guess I was entertained. That's why I gave it 3 stars. If it were just some movie that I stumbled upon, I might have given it 5 or 6. Since this was was kinda chosen to be the best movie in the world though, it really fell flat for me.This might have been better off as an animated film. Each scene requires you to utterly suspend your disbelief in reality.The ending was just plain stupid. You send an essay-length letter out into the ether in morse code every night just hoping your son might see it? Then, as it magically turns out, your son DOES happen to see it while climbing a mountain one night and spending hours watching a house where the worst trauma of his life happened. Even though it got dark and he was freezing, he stayed there anyway and watched intently enough to notice a flickering light? Also, the light was alluded to early in the movie. A person that owns a multi-million dollar property does NOT tolerate faulty electrical work for any length of time. The moment that basement guy first headbutted the switch to make the light flicker, an electrician would have been called and the premise of the movie would have been ended by the electrician going down to the basement.What was EVEN MORE STUPID was the son, Kevin, just deciding to be a millionaire. Ok I'll accept that he's a millionaire now after a wave of the magic wand. Not too hard to do in Korea, apparently. I guess they have short memories and forgot that he was involved in an extortion plot that resulted in 3 people being murdered - including his sister. Didn't the investigation of that incident involve anyone discovering the basement? Those investigators seem like they did a bang up job! THEN Kevin buys the very house where the rampage took place! Did he change his identity somewhere? I'm not being too eloquent with this review. I have a feeling if you have stuck with reading this that we're probably on the same wavelength already.The main point I want to make is that the true parasites in this world are the ones that have built empires out of the tiny scraps that the masses have discarded. We have all put down $12 here, $5 there, $7 here again to watch a movie or to see some kind of entertainment. Would you have paid $20 to watch this? Probably not. The parasites are the ones who got fat from tricking everyone into thinking that have unique skill sets. So unique that they should be rich for providing you with a piece of trash movie that you paid $5 an hour to watch.I know no one read this, but I'm glad I got to drop in my opinion anyway. I'm also happy to be able to contribute to lowering the rating of this movie.\n",

      "Two families very different, one poor, namely the Kim family, and the other rich, the Park family, but there is one thing that unites them, for different reasons they are both parasites. The director, Bong Joon-ho, he wanted to show the traits of poverty in South Korea, starting with a comedy of deception, where the poor screw the rich. Everything will seem to have been accomplished, the poor have cheated the money, but at any moment the situation is reversed, so much so that the film becomes a tragedy, which will also end with some killings. This film also has a very precise directorial rendering, which manages to better frame the meaning of the film. Just think of the two windows of the houses of the two families, one protruding from underground where you can see people urinating, the other instead protruding on a splendid garden. When you come from the rich there is always to go higher, when you come from the poor there is always to go lower and lower. A great significance is given by the smell in the film, different smells. This film deserved the Oscar and the Palme d'Or at Cannes, because it manages to mix the directing work and the moral that the film wants you to reach almost perfectly.\n",
      "Parasite has it all. Direction, acting , screenplay and camerawork are all award level.This film is not boring, and the first hour is about as fascinating and attention grabbing as a movie can be. The second hour is not quite as successful as the first, in my opinion, but is still high level entertainment.The key to Parasite is the script, which is tasked with leading the viewer through a myriad of pinpoint plot developments that always seem to be teetering on a razors edge. I feel safe to say this is one of the best screenplays of the 21st century.If I had to summarize Parasite it would be , \"never a dull moment\".\n",
      "Amazing !! Mind blowing!!! If you haven't watched it yet, watch it right now\n",
      "I've never been much of a person for movies, but I didn't really have a choice but to start watching some of the more popular ones as I became friends with people into cinema.I cannot express my love for this movie enough - I've seen it four times now (showing it to anyone who will watch it with me, and once in theaters) and it is just as good every time. Creative camerawork, greedy yet redeemable characters who talk like real people, and the craziest plot twists that nobody could see coming.The ending reminds me of Midsommar in a way that it uses bright, lush greenery and beautiful people standing against scenes of brutal murder. The stark contrast makes these types of scenes so surreal and almost romantic, in a way. Bright green on bright red, with copious amounts of sunshine spilling in. It slices right through the serene atmosphere. Loss in Parasite is permanent - it is not resolved by a cut to \"ten years later\" where all of the protagonists have recovered and are back to normal. There is no mercy in this film and I love it.\n",
      "Absolutely the best film of the year. An amazing blend of all genres. What wonderful execution.\n",
      "While set in Korea, the main theme of this movie is as universal as the most basic of human nature, as in \"Se7en\" (1995). We saw the same sentiments played out in the French Revolution - the Have-not getting even with the Have. In the French Revolution, it played out as revolution and guillotines. Here in \"Parasite\" it plays out as a multiple con job turned ugly - no decapitation, mind you, but with blood and gore to match.There are two remarkable things about this movie. The first is the change, abruptly at the mid-point, in tone from farce-like comedy to horror-like thriller. The other thing is the matter-of-course approach at both. Neither the comedy nor the horror is laboured or deliberately crafted. While the plot may sound outlandish, the delivery is so natural as to make it believable. A great deal of credit goes to the splendid cast.The movie opens with a crispy introduction of a \"cheap\" family, in every sense of the word. Out of a cramped basement, riding on a lucky break, the four members successively and successfully con their way into the household of a slick, ultra-modern, luxurious mega estate. First, the son becomes the English tutor of a naïve girl at puberty. He quickly gets his sister a job as the arts tutor of the girl's little brother. The father and mother, with the sibling's cunning plotting, soon replace the existing housekeeper and chauffer. The couple that employ them are unsuspicious, if not entirely gullible. At this point, nobody can fault you for thinking that the title refers, obviously, to these four.Then comes the twist at midpoint. When the masters take their kids on a camping trip, the \"parasite\" family live like royalties, albeit transiently. But it turns out that they are not the only \"parasite\" because there is one that fits the description even better - living in the bowels. A sudden visit from the discharged housekeeper reveals a secret - she has been hiding her husband in a secret basement unknown to the masters. Then, when the camping trip is cut short by foul weather, all hell breaks loose.While people may call this movie different things, the crux of the matter is the revelation of the resentment the Have-not harboured towards the Have.\n",
      "I mean, what else could you really ask for? The film does so many things right, sorry, it does everything right and for that reason it's a masterpiece. Like, how the hell did anyone not expect this film to win Best Picture at the Oscars.\n",
      "The Best Movie in the history Of cinema, great actors\n",
      "Yeah. Wait for it. Tent. How to eat a banana. Hmmm. American Made.\n",
      "Amazing let no trick be hiden in this woumdeful tale watch it now.\n",
      "Somewhere in a slum of South Korea, a tight-knit, underprivileged family (two parents, two kids) struggle to make ends meet, each day clinging to the hope of wealth and good fortune. When the son lands a gig tutoring the child of a well-to-do family, the father seizes the opportunity to escape their squalid existence...to reveal any more would be a travesty. Takes its time getting started, but once it does hang on! Spellbinding mixture of social commentary, greed, horror, dark comedy, family, haves and have-nots, and an unpredictable narrative with creative, clever story twists that you can't possibly see coming, this gem inspires a multitude of emotions like anger, sadness, pity, humorous shock and awe, and just refuses to let up. The ending is padded-out, and definitely stretches the limits of credulity, but the film's overall impact is simply undeniable. This is daring, ambitious, and ingeniously handled by Bong Joon-ho (deservedly earning a best director Oscar) who manages to pull the rug out even when you're sure you've got things figured out. ***½\n",
      "I loved the characters so much.Everyone was so clever and different.\n",
      "I'd like the first intention of the film but doesn't like the way it's developed\n",
      "This movie was lit asf. A brother gets angry cause he smells like 💩 because of the bad life that he has had, but his son and daugther are smart asf and they are going to get them out of the nasty hole they live in.\n",
      "The film's momentum transcends words however all I can say is \"Bong Joon-ho created a a masterpiece. Unspoken subtle truths overlayed by am immersive cinematic experience you will not forget. Definitely a must see if you tired of the same old movies.\n"

       "[['It\\'s not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn\\'t like the second half of it.It\\'s much easier to understand the message of a movie when the \\'good guys\\' win or the \\'bad guys\\' get punished in the end. I\\'m not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there\\'s a character with a clearer \\'moral center\\' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it\\'s no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don\\'t understand Ki-Taek\\'s motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, \"crossing the line\".It\\'s a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people\\'s privacy or as one should mind one\\'s own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families\\' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to \\'cross the line\\' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it\\'s quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park\\'s house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park\\'s family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn\\'t even smell like him.Ki-Taek\\'s final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son\\'s shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek\\'s daughter\\'s status who\\'s dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the \\'line\\' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those \\'lesser\\' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those \\'proper\\' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek\\'s family to sneak into Mr. Park\\'s house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park\\'s family, their existence is no better than that of a \\'parasite\\', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host\\'s body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park\\'s or Ki-Taek\\'s personalities. Instead, it\\'s a \\'line\\' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn\\'t change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.'],\n",

He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.\"],\n",

I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible.\"],\n",

Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.\\nThe conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen.

Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it\\'s like 50 minutes in, and it\\'s too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.THE BAD:We\\'ve all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it\\'s supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, \"Man, these criminals are effing morons, it\\'s just NOT believable. You\\'ve seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It\\'s just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they\\'re all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn\\'t work.The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family\\'s living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a \"what if.\" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn\\'t even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it\\'s too late.The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we\\'re down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.Minor point, but the housekeeper\\'s husband who\\'s been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.All in all, not the worst film I\\'ve ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it\\'s getting here.

       " [\"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money.\"],\n",
       " ['Set in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.The story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say \"social climbing\". It\\'s like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.Now, I won\\'t spoil the plot twists for you, but let\\'s just say things take a turn for the... well, let\\'s just say they take a turn.

Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim\\'s family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won\\'t be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.'],\n",
       " [\"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.\"],\n",

Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.\\nIf you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it.

       " [\"Parasite\\nHollywood Theater\\n11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times.\"],\n",

It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here.

However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really.\"],\n",

There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank.

This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason.

TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory.\"],\n",

A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d\\'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...\\nIt\\'s not just a bad story, no, it\\'s actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn\\'t make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I\\'m supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn\\'t like them either, I don\\'t see what\\'s so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them \"lovable\". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.Post Oscars Addition:\\nTechnically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I\\'m sure that most fans don\\'t care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money.

And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn\\'t it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?'],\n",
       " ['Parasite\\nHollywood Theater\\n11/09/19Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you\\'re cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:Part One:Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can\\'t go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I\\'ve been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D\\'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I\\'ll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you\\'re in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.It\\'s worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you\\'ll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you \"Terminator: Dark Fate,\" and John Cena\\'s new firehouse dog movie \"Playing with Fire,\" will keep you company while you wait.Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye\\' ave\\' been warnd\\' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It\\'s a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it\\'s an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two \\'twentysomething\\' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.\\nWhen a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He\\'s totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren\\'t. That\\'s something I respect about Parasite, there aren\\'t any clear cut villains or heroes. It\\'s not that kind of story. It\\'s so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn\\'t belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It\\'s visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can\\'t smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It\\'s hard to explain but if you\\'ve seen Parasite you\\'ll get what I am talking about.Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It\\'s absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino\\'s: \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that\\'s exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say.

Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes.

Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all.

       " [\"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.\"],\n",

His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.\\nIn addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.\\nThis soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.\\nTheir crimes are as follows:Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.Stealing food and alcohol.Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:Lived underground for 4 yearsHad a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of himWas deadThe Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be.

The premise alone is captivating. As the film progresses, a funny comedy becomes more and more of a thriller/splatter, which brings a great twist to the plot.-The dialogues are surprisingly interesting and funny. Above all, the dialogues between the two families and the gap between rich and poor that arise are captivating.-Not only the dialogues but also the entire game and the building of emotions is perfect. How the hatred of the rich family slowly increases and the disgusting behavior of the upper class is explained is fascinating.-The socially critical commentary that is repeatedly interspersed into the film is clever and gives the film another level.-The twist halfway through the film that the housewife's husband lives in the basement was a shock and brings a huge and surprising turn to the story.Negative:-Unfortunately, our protagonists are not likeable. It is a group of losers and impostors who end up committing cruel acts.-The ending isn't perfect and the film would have needed more time to process the events. The characters commit terrible acts. The film doesn't glorify this behavior but still portrays them as the good ones, which is reprehensible. In the end they are still the victims, but the film forgets that they got themselves into this situation because they wanted quick money.All the deaths, both within the family and the murders they committed, are never dealt with.-The film does criticize society but in a very weak way. In the end, the poor are the good victims and the rich are the vain evil ones.Conclusion: A good and clever black comedy.

It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars\"],\n",
       " [\"Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor.\"],\n",

Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the \"top\". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film\\'s atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life.'],\n",

Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja.

       " ['See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn\\'t a masterpiece in any regard.The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims\\' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.And the \"wealth rock\" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it\\'s one dead, two on probation and one \"scot-free\" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks\\' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets \"lesson learned (maybe)\". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child\\'s birthday party to get a couple of them to say, \"aw shucks, maybe this wasn\\'t a great plan\". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. \"The whole notion of \"why bother\" makes no sense or point thematically in art.'],\n",
       " [\"I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper/more groundbreaking than it actually is. It has the plot of a rom-com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary. Wow! Class differences exist! Thanks Bong Joon-ho for enlightening me.Just because you've successfully deciphered what the director/writer sought to convey doesn't mean he's necessarily saying anything profound. People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that, despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film, its significance remains painfully surface-level.I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves--and it's fitting. During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events, I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture (alongside the universal acclaim).Well, after the former housekeeper's return, the stupidity that ensues (yes--that moment and the very end inclusive) signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise. However, it's here where the film starts to break down for me.We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening. That's ok for some time, for some genres, but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy. The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to. And on top of it, I genuinely don't care what happens to any of these people (save a tinge of regret for Mr. Park's taking a knife to the chest), I find it impossible that the tutor-son could survive two (2) skull-crushing throws of a rock to the head, and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr. Kim committing the murder in the first place, even given the heat of the moment and his motivations.I was almost peer-pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I've seen none so low as mine, but 3 just feels right. Something unconnected that I need to insert; the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn't even there for me either.

My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of \"tonal whiplash\", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home?

His \"heroes\" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.The inciting incident involves Ki-woo\\'s friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he\\'s going abroad and he\\'ll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself \"Jessica\" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park\\'s driver, who\\'s now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces \"Uncle Kim\" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the \"uncle\" is of course Jessica\\'s dad and he\\'s immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it\\'s discovered she\\'s allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When \"Uncle Kim\" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it\\'s revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there\\'s a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).When Moon-kwang discovers the new \"hired help\" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they\\'re simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is \"permitting the outrage without the consequences.\" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They\\'re forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it\\'s been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park\\'s reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he\\'ll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet.'],\n",

Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent.\"],\n",

Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script.

       " ['This film\\'s ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it\\'s way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it\\'s general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. \"Parasite\" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it\\'s position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I\\'m curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it\\'s way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim\\'s weren\\'t able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim\\'s demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It\\'s not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park\\'s. Not that it wasn\\'t done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim\\'s luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim\\'s had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim\\'s from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim\\'s (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can\\'t say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of \\'crossing the line\\' that the Kim\\'s were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it\\'s denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo\\'s survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who\\'s to say that Kim-woo\\'s plan to rescue his dad wasn\\'t a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - \"\"If you make a plan, life never works out that way\". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park\\'s, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn\\'t turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year\\'s Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I\\'m not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture\\'s chances at the Oscars.

The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn\\'t home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age.

So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she\\'s meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper. They succeed. When the Parks leave for a weekend, the Kims celebrate in the mansion. Then the former housekeeper shows up. She reveals that there is a secret basement where she\\'s been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money. Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her. She takes some video. The families fight over the video. Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon. The Kims hide under the living room table. The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured. Her husband is bound back in his basement room.Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room.

In the middle of the party, the housekeeper\\'s husband has freed himself. and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim\\'s head in with his good luck rock, then attacks daughter Kim with a knife. Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims. That leads father Kim to attack Park after he\\'s taken care of the housekeeper\\'s husband.Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working/scheming family and the wealthy/naive family whose \"problems\" are mostly blown up minor issues. The characters are slightly cartoonish. Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2/3rds of the movie. You do end up rooting for the Kims. The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse. It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn\\'t recover. From then on you know and expect something you happen, you just don\\'t know from which direction it will come. In the end it\\'s somewhat of a surprise but it doesn\\'t amount to much really.Sure, economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor, no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable, thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed. It\\'s not so much about class warfare but rather codependency. As with any codependent relationship, there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments.

Since then, ten others have been nominated and in 2019 Parasite was the first to win.Bong Joon-Ho described the film as symbolic of the class barrier in Korea and symbolism is the only description or justification for the movie; which is very unorthodox in its plot, structure and overall style.\\nThe catalyst the film is Kevin accepting to fill in for his friend as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family's daughter. The first act ends when the entire Kim family secures a job in the Park residence. After that the story starts to lose control.\\nAt first, the film quickly advances in a clipped, transient style. Bong Joon-Ho establishes the setting and composition of his film and then sets forth. No scene lingers too long and each sets the other up so by just seeing the tail end of it the audience understands what's happened. The characters are quirky and idiosyncratic black humor is bestrewed throughout creating a light and comedic tone. And then out of nowhere the film takes a sharp turn with the Kim's discovering the former maid's husband, Geun-sae, living in the basement. Ho has admitted he is an Alfred Hitchcock fan(clearly demonstrated by the Hitchcock collection in the Park house) and attempted to imitate the incredible twists that became a trademark of The Master Of Suspense. However, Parasite's twist fails to deliver the punch that those in Psycho, North By Northwest and Vertigo do. It doesn't change the story or further complicate it but instead creates an entirely new and separate plot. Don't get me wrong, a good twist in a movie is meant to alter its course(e.g. Judy/Madeleine's identity revealed in Vertigo) or when placed at the very end to completely alter your perception of all that you just saw(Citizen Kane, The Sixth Sense, Psycho) In Parasite no new dimension is added to the film but essentially everything leading up is made irrelevant.\\nFor roughly the last half, the movie meanders with no direction before finally collapsing. The birthday party 'finale' is shocking and senseless. What prompts both men to murder, particularly Mr. Kim, is unknown. Is it a final accumulation of his contempt for the upper class ? Whatever it is, everything that follows drags like car with no wheels. Bong Joon-Ho brings the pace to a near halt and spends the final moments of this film trying to pile on every last bit of emotion and sentiment possible. And as always, all impact is only sucked out by the ennui and frustration.Since I don't understand Korean I can't accurately judge the dialogue or\\nacting because no matter how precise a translation is, something is always lost.\\nOne is merely left to follow with the subtitles and what an actor emotes non-verbally-which can never be the same.Parasite is a film that probably resembles half a dozen genres...which means it doesn't cover any properly.

Covering up a whole lot of them and that\\'s what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.2.

He also tells you that he\\'s coming back and will ask the rich\\'s family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he\\'s interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn\\'t.What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his \"best friend\", and also finds out the \"best friend\" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man\\'s family, working under false pretenses.A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you?\\nB: Expose you and your entire family?Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.Anyone care to tell me?

I left so much mess here, what do I do now?4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I\\'m going to die.Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C\\'mon.

Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention.

       " [\"Parasite\\nI think the most brilliant part of this film is the construction of 3 spaces:the house lived by Park's family, the basement lived by Kim Ki-woo's family,and the basement under the house ,which is lived by the original housekeeper's husband.The design of the 3 spaces is a metaphor for the difference in the classes of the 3 family. Every time Kim Ki-woo goes to the house to teach the girl, he has to go on a slope. And when the family run away from the house they have to go down stairs. The rich people living in the house can see the sunshine and grassland, while the family living in the basement can only see passerby's foot, and the man living under the house can never see anything outside that basement. The movie indicates the different living conditions between people in different classes.And the design of the spaces also matches the title of the movie,which is the parasite. Kim Ki-woo's family lives like a parasite. They hide themselves under the table listening the complaints about their smell from the rich. What between the different spaces is the line that can't be crossed.The movie constructed an illusion that the poor living in the rich's house and enjoy the life as the rich does. However, the illusion is broken and all of the poor come back to the real world when the real rich come home. In the real world, those rich people have not only wealth but power. They utilize those who want to climb up and push them when they near the top.It reflects the hidden unfairness in the capitalism. The owner of the power creates a dream for those down on the ground, and encourage them to climb up. But everything end up as foam. It is just like what the movie The Great Gatsby, which talks about a man's dream breaks.\"],\n",
       " ['While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached. It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed...? Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family. Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people, getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction. When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in...? She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases. The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion. All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment. I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it.The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion (that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless). The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don\\'t remember any of it.The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie. While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea, metaphors do not make a movie magically better. While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment, the movie cannot stand on it alone. I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its \"gimmick\" of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer. The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew. I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite, especially from the actors. If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you, but it is highly subjective and does not make the film \"the masterpiece of a century\". A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top. A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg.I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section. With a more likable poor family, lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story, this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been, but it would have been far more enjoyable for me. But thats okay, movies are not just made for me, a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie, so its current form definitely has a right to exist.'],\n",
       " [\"Almost four years ago, South Korea's PARASITE made history by becoming the first movie not in the English language to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. That PARASITE would claim the Foreign Language prize was never in doubt. But winning the big Kahuna?? That was a different kettle of fish altogether. Only two other foreign films, Z and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, found themselves nominated in both categories, winning only for Foreign Language. And yet PARASITE won both!! Released to overwhelmingly favorable reviews in the spring of 2019, it gained far-reaching attention when it captured the Palme D'Or at Cannes. That victory was further capped by positive feedback at subsequent film festivals leading all the way to the year-end awards season.PARASITE was written by Bong Joon-ho, a Korean filmmaker whose resumé consisted of motion pictures that explored the dark side of übercapitalism. Bong's worldwide profile increased tenfold when he made SNOWPIERCER starring a distinguished international cast that included Captain America himself, Chris Evans, along with Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, and Korean leading man Song Kang-ho. A few years afterwards, Bong directed OKJA, a hybrid sci-fi/OLD YELLER story about a genetically enhanced porcine boasting yet another international cast.It was while filming the latter that Bong applied the finishing touches to PARASITE, which he claimed was inspired by at least two sources. The first was an obscure South Korean movie called THE HOUSEMAID about a middle class family whose lives are upended by the presence of a sexually provocative domestic servant. Another influence on PARASITE was the real-life case of the Papin sisters from 1930s France.PARASITE is about two families in present day Seoul who couldn't be more different from each other: the underprivileged Kims and the affluent Parks. The Kim clan live in a basement apartment where they have a wi-fi connection so lousy they sponge off the neighbor by standing in the bathtub to get a decent phone signal. They also endure neighborhood fumigations, stink bugs, and the daily, impossible-to-unsee sight of a wino urinating outside their window. With dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) unemployed, mom Chung-sook and daughter Ki-jung {aka Jessica} earn their keep folding pizza boxes. Their son Ki-woo {aka Kevin} is the most academically promising family member, but the Kims' low income status is destined to make his postsecondary education unfeasible.Kevin's friend Min is due to study abroad and casually suggests that he take over for him as an English language tutor for the adolescent daughter of the Park family. Min will be more than happy to vouch for Kevin, providing he's able to produce the proper credentials. Enter Jessica, who expertly photoshops a forged university certificate for her brother to present to the Park mother, a friendly yet gullible thirtysomething woman who, despite having a live-in housekeeper, finds maintaining the household a handful.The Park home is something I would describe as architectural eye candy, a two-story New Age mansion personally designed by the previous owner. Kevin feels understandably overwhelmed upon entering this domestic Utopia, but knows he must concentrate on the job at hand. His pupil is going through the usual teenage phase of becoming aware of her sexuality, while the preadolescent son obsesses over his belief that a ghost dwells within their house. Kevin suggests to Mrs Park that the boy needs to channel his energetic mind towards art therapy, telling her that he knows a friend of a friend that specializes in this form of psychology. Of course, he's referring to sister Jessica, but conceals the sibling relationship from his new employer.After googling the rudiments about art, Jessica is introduced to Mrs Park, and easily bluffs her way into employment. While being driven home in the family Mercedes Benz, Jessica schemes to oust the chauffeur by blithely removing her panties and strategically placing the undergarments beneath the driver's seat. The Parks, believing that he was using the vehicle for his sexual indiscretions, promptly fire him. Naturally, Jessica recommends a replacement....and here comes dear ol' dad Ki-taek.But usurping housekeeper Moon-gwang is going to be more problematic, however, because her tenure predates the Parks, going all the way back to the original architect owner. By being entrenched in the house for so long, she knows every nook and cranny inside and out better than anyone else. Doing a little bit of research, the Kims discover that her Achilles heel is a peach allergy, which the family of freeloaders shrewdly exploit to induce anaphylaxis....but imply tuberculosis. And guess who's waiting in the wings to replace Typhoid Moon? Yup, you got it!! Mom Chung-sook.So now the Kims ate sitting pretty enjoying someone else's opulent lifestyle....so long as they can sustain the deception. But the Parks' young son innocuously notices something amiss about them without really noticing it. Having an acute sense of smell, he nonchalantly comments how every one of their recent houseguests all seem to have the same odor....and yet they're supposed to be almost unknown to one another! Indeed, Mr Park readily admits that he refuses to ride in the subway because he doesn't want to ride amongst people carrying a lower-class stench on them.Luxury comes a-knocking for the Kims when the Parks pack up for an out-of-town camping trip. Left in charge of the house is the new live-in housekeeper Chung-sook, who secretly brings Ki-taek, Jessica, and Kevin over to temporarily live like royalty before their unwitting hosts return in a couple of days. But at the movie's halfway point, a plot twist occurs {which I will not divulge} that threatens to topple their carefully constructed house of cards.Bong Joon-ho takes pains not to pass judgment on the hard luck, yet opportunistic kinfolk, portraying them as flawed victims of an economic class disparity. To symbolize this inequality, Bong employs some clever visual touches. For example, when we see the Park family on the stairs of their elegantly modernistic suburbia, it's always when they're ascending, not descending. These shots illustrate their upward social mobility....as opposed to the other clan. In delineating the Kims' hardscrabble existence, the director repeatedly shows them in a declining stairway motion, serving as a metaphor for their bottom rung stature. Oddly, PARASITE found an unlikely admirer in North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who couldn't resist using the film to highlight the difference between the two Koreas, an example of the class warfare within his southern neighbor....and of capitalism overall.It's difficult to pin PARASITE down to any specific film genre. In promotional interviews, Bong described his movie as a comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains. Like a Coen Brothers picture, there's a magnificent wickedness on display in which we find ourselves snickering at situations we'd ordinarily be shocked and repulsed at in the real world. We understand the Kim family's need to seek a better life for themselves yet disapprove of their methods....even as we wind up laughing at some of them.Bong Joon-ho also took home Academy Awards for Director and Screenplay over such distinguished competition from Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Sam Mendes. Bong's triumph was certainly a dark horse, but, in retrospect, it really shouldn't have been. Over the past decade, Oscar's directing trophy has been truly international, with the recipients being French, Taiwanese, and especially Mexican. Just the previous year, Alfonso Cuarón won his second statuette in that category....for a movie not in the English language. Hopefully, PARASITE's victory will open up the eyes of mainstream audiences unused to reading subtitles at the bottom of the screen. To paraphrase Bogie, perhaps this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 🔚\"],\n",

       " ['So, I finally watched Parasite. While the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor, I still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the Oscars.For a best picture type of film I expect more: Top visuals, scenery, camera, sound effects, music, mixing, wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story. While those actors weren\\'t especially bad, they were not great either. Especially the rich woman acted over the top.Now the story: For me this story was unfolding to easy, too cheap. At the start of the movie, the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors. There are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again. And there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves. The family in Parasite falls into the second category. They are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly. Nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs. Yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiy\\'s home and those rich people (the father is a business man - so not a dumb person) aren\\'t suspicious or realize that they are impostors (the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid???). Nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a driver\\'s or a maid\\'s job. Nope, they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours.The \"worst\" about the story: I could not sympathise with the poor family in the end. It was not like \"Yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement, they deserve better\". In contrary. Especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years, this parasite family does not connect with those people. They don\\'t treat them better like they were treated before by richer people. They instead want to call the police. And when the former maid finds out that this family are impostors, she also does not connect with them, but tries to blackmail them.So the morale of the story is: Poor people are as bad as rich people and treat their kind with disrespect as well. In the end I had more sympathy with the rich family than with any of those impostors. It wasn\\'t a story about \"from dish washer to millionaire\". It was a story about an unlikable, criminal family that in the end had no redeeming factors at all.'],\n",

And the worst of all the party at the end. Why did the father Ki Taek killed Mr. Park? Because he was a bit selfish? Ki Taek just standed there doing nothing when his daughter was dying and his wife was fighting. Mr. Park just wanted keys to the car but for both his son and Ki Taek son.

Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant, and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot. If you haven't seen Parasite yet, I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it.The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite. On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably, while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims. The twist adds to the complexity of the situation - who's the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations? The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house. It's also an edge of your seat thriller where you're so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape. Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense. The comedy is an underrated element, as many scenes were very funny, especially the self-portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical. The acting was all excellent, and my two favorite performances were Jessica (the sister), who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor, and Mrs. Park, who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly. The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes, especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot, with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house, or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down, down, down.

A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help.

First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror.

It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation.\\nRepugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices.\\nNot surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes.

I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo\\'s friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park\\'s house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias \"Kevin\" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song\\'s artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song\\'s art therapist.Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park\\'s Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim\\'s present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim\\'s settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim\\'s fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they\\'re all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song\\'s birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park\\'s residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park\\'s call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don\\'t find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.Overall, Parasite gets a 10.'],\n",

       " [\"Long before Parasite ended (I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish) I had diagnosed Bong Joon-ho with ADHD. The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story: slapstick, hard-hitting social commentary, mystery, comedy of manners, tear-jerker or thriller.There's a lot of good acting, but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character's situation. It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago, where every production had to cover all the bases: romance, crime, thrilling chases, and lots of hilarious (well, meant meant to be hilarious) comic relief. This wasn't as much fun. At the end, I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale, but I was very happy. I only rented the film.\"],\n",
       " [\"Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing.\"],\n",

A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic.\"],\n",

Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films\\' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea.

Unbeknownst to them, the family of lying 'good for nothings' have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees, they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown.Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them? I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next.

Not even with some big originality.Suddenly i must say the basement thing. OK we're going somewhere different but for what ? Even this idea is not really going deeper.Some tallk about class fighting. Rich vs poor ? Really this thing so.. already seen. With a family of poor people almost sociopath ? We dont root for them, as we dont root for the rich either (questionnable..).The only thing i like was the last scene. The boy responding to his father that he will become rich and buy the house. And as all plans do go well we can think that it will never happen and the father will surely die in the basement. And with (good?) reason.Bref. All that for that. Not worth an Oscar for a long shot.

       " ['Okay, so these slightly over two hours are \"Parasite\" or \"Gisaengchung\", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d\\'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don\\'t think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son\\'s friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family\\'s house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film\\'s end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I\\'d say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist\\'s family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family\\'s son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don\\'t see him. Don\\'t suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man\\'s smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I\\'d say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino\\'s. Scorsese\\'s is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don\\'t do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don\\'t go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now.'],\n",

And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes, while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation?\\nThere is a scene with the Da-Song sitting in a tipi, writing the message of \"HELP\" that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp. The movie never addresses that later. Why the boy did not inform parents about that. And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp, and strange patterns of the flashing light?\\nHow it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years????\\nThere are just some of the questions I had.

It\\'s like \"Us\" but without the supernatural element. Of course, a scheme like theirs can\\'t succeed without something going very wrong which, of course, it does turning \"Parasite\" beautifully and brilliantly into the blackest of comedy-thrillers that does finally manage to erupt into just the kind of horror flic we expected from the start.With pitch-perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year, not to mention the kind of home any family would be happy to invade, this is an instant classic.

       " ['For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho\\'s \"Parasite\", I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was \"Old Boy\" and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn\\'t expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn\\'t even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn\\'t sure I liked it, but I wasn\\'t sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here\\'s my personal take, and apologies if I don\\'t mention the actors\\' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn\\'t make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don\\'t think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele\\'s \"Get Out\", a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn\\'t expect it the catalyst, and film\\'s leitmotif, to be something as trivial as \"smell\". You read me.There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.1/ \"They have the same smell\": we\\'ve come to the comical momentum where every member of the \"poor\" family got a job in the rich property. They\\'re all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it\\'s the little kid who smells something \\'fishy\\' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn\\'t treat it as the hint that there\\'s something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver\\'s work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father\\'s reaction, he realizes that he\\'s not just a man or a valuable employee, he\\'s got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father\\'s comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn\\'t been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don\\'t like it, they just don\\'t have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones\\' perspectives, people who don\\'t mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man\\'s body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter\\'s life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.If there\\'s one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it\\'s \"Parasite\" and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner \"The Eel\", where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius.'],\n",

He decisions are really bad. They got a young man fired, they don't care if he's poor and miserable as they are. They only think about themselves - selfish.They found out about the maid's secret but instead of negotiating something. They chose to fight all over the place.Mrs Kim the mother is heartless too, she pushed the poor maid down the stairs which ultimately ended her life, and then they tied them up in the bunker, wounded, no food and they go on to live their lives normally. And they expect to find them alive in the following morning?And what's up with that rock, I thought it was going to be used for something important but no it was there all this time so that it would used to smashed the son's head. lolThe party is where everything goes wrong. When the bunker guy show up and stab the kim sister and looking to kill the mother, it wasn't Mr Kim's problem at that time, his mind was totally on Mr park, and helping his family comes second I guess. he went ahead and stab Mr Park even though he employed him and pay him good money. He then left his bleeding daughter and son and his wounded wife to go hide in the bunker. Gimme a break.the behavior of the Kim family can't be excused because they re just poor. Poor people don't normally behave in an erratic way and are contented.And since both the Kim family and the Park family helped each other in certain ways, knowingly or unknowingly, isn't their relationship symbiotic?

So unreal, so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people's moral..The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters, as when Ki-woo was entering Parks' villa, the surrounding was just pushing towards him.I really like some of the details of the movie's plot, especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain, probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain-free dwelling, only to find out the basement flooded. The scene when Ki-jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic. No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done, the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound. The scene when the Parkers' dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun-sae's back was also amazing. I might be over interpreting, but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun-sae dies, nobody would care, not even human's best friend.Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors' expressions when watching the subbed version.And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles, the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn't read them.

The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see.

Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own.

The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too.'],\n",
       " ['Parasite failed to grab my interest near the start. Later on it picks up momentum and becomes quite engaging. But this is less because I liked it and more because it manages to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions. By the end, it felt like the exercise was a waste of time or worse. Worse because I worry that the filmmakers and many fans actually sympathise with the murderers, just because they\\'re apparently poor.The premise falls apart when you think about it. While it\\'s somewhat entertaining at first, seeing the main family lie a bit to get jobs supporting a rich family, it really sinks in that there\\'s no reason for them to be poor. If the girl can fake university documents, if the boy can tutor English, if the father knows streets well and can drive confidently - why on Earth can\\'t they get proper jobs? They can fake being qualified and well-off so they can succeed in job interviews!Little lies are one thing, like faking a degree to get your foot in the door. It\\'s wrong, but it\\'s not that bad if we\\'re meant to believe there\\'s some kind of unfair system. But after that, we see more and more how immoral, selfish and ungrateful the \"poor\" family is. As Dickens might put it, however poor they are in terms of wealth, they\\'re much poorer when it comes to decency and morals.The girl lying about art therapy to manipulate the mother is appalling. Are we meant to find that funny? The way she talks about the rich family behind their backs is also very demeaning. The main bad things the rich family does is 1) be rich (so what?) and 2) complain about smell. Nobody likes bad smells. It\\'s very reasonable that a part of progressing economically is taking care of personal hygiene. It\\'s a practical thing, not a class thing.What they do to the previous maid is also terrible. Abusing her allergy. And planting underwear to frame the driver. The boy flirting with the girl he\\'s meant to be tutoring.They don\\'t care about the lives they ruin, as long as they get ahead. We never once see them apply for jobs. They use their intelligence to manipulate others and only progress by bringing others down. I felt that the only happy ending would be one where they all get killed by some psycho killer, or at least where they all get exposed.The best section is in the middle where a single night spirals out of control and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But even this was somewhat predictable and convenient for the writers. Why are they partying at this house? Who couldn\\'t guess that an emergency would arise and the family would return early?The maid coming back and having her husband locked in a cellar was a nice touch. You don\\'t know where the story is going from there. But while this could make for a decent horror or thriller, it doesn\\'t gel with the rest of the movie, which is more of a comedy/drama.The ending is frustrating. I hated the poor family. They\\'ve now killed a woman on top of everything else. I understand the cellar husband\\'s desire for revenge. But when the poor father kills the rich father? There was no justification for that. I liked the rich family. They were nice people. The father earned his money. The mother cared about her children and was very open and kind. The kids are normal kids.It makes no sense. The dad hides in the cellar. Sure. But you\\'re telling me the police didn\\'t look there? The son\\'s bloody body was right next to the cellar entrance. They didn\\'t search the room? Look at blueprints for the house? This guy comes out of nowhere, probably presumed dead, and goes on a rampage and they don\\'t search the house more thoroughly?And it seems like the filmmakers want us to empathise with the murderous father. Sorry, but he should rot in jail. Along with his whole family who were complicit in all this. The maid was pretty crazy too, keeping her husband in a cellar. Wasn\\'t she earning enough? Couldn\\'t they pay off the debt, even if it took years? Why not be honest to the rich family?Parasite is misguided and extremely overrated. It\\'s decent as a thriller/horror, at least for part of its running time. It has good acting and directing. There are a few funny moments. But the message is deeply confused and immoral. Poverty doesn\\'t justify murder. Or lying or destroying other people\\'s jobs.And if you have so many skills (the girl seems very smart and good with computers), why are you folding pizza boxes for a living? They can\\'t get proper jobs? I call BS. Even when they all get jobs by lying, they don\\'t move to a better apartment or improve their lifestyle. They\\'re only poor because the script says so, not because it\\'s remotely believable.'],\n",

The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation.

Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to.\"],\n",

The film was gripping, and I couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen, but it left me feeling a bit unsettled.First off, the story was amazing. I loved how it started with the poor Kim family trying to make ends meet and slowly infiltrating the wealthy Park family\\'s life. It was clever and often funny to see how they managed to deceive the Parks. The whole idea of the \"parasite\" theme, where the Kims live off the Parks, was really interesting.The acting was top-notch. Every character felt real and relatable. Ki-taek, the father, was especially great, and I felt for him as he tried to provide for his family. The son, Ki-woo, was also fantastic, and his ambition drove much of the plot forward.However, the movie took a dark turn that I didn\\'t see coming. The discovery of the basement and the man living there was shocking. It added a whole new layer of tension and danger. The scene where the old housekeeper returns and tries to reveal the Kims\\' secret had me on the edge of my seat.The ending was intense and brutal. The birthday party turning into a bloodbath was hard to watch. Seeing Ki-taek snap and kill Mr. Park was unexpected and tragic. It made me question if the Kims were really the \"bad guys\" or just victims of their circumstances.I think what left me with mixed feelings is the bleak message of the movie. It shows the harsh realities of class division and how desperate people can become. While the movie was brilliant, it was also quite depressing. The final scene, where Ki-woo dreams of buying the house to reunite with his father, felt like a punch in the gut because we know it\\'s almost impossible.Overall, \"Parasite\" was a fantastic film with incredible storytelling and performances. It kept me hooked from start to finish, but the dark themes and tragic ending left me feeling conflicted. It\\'s definitely a movie that makes you think and stays with you long after it\\'s over.'],\n",

       " [\"Better late than never, I say. Parasite has shocked the film world, in the best way possible. Against all odds, it defeated a crowded field for Best Picture at the Oscars. A field that included heavy hitters like Scorsese and Tarantino. Nobody should have ever counted Parasite out, but the Oscars don't have a track record of awarding Best Picture to groundbreaking independent films, let alone a groundbreaking independent film from South Korea. It's win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere. It's a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes. Garnering international acclaim, people have hailed Parasite as the best film of 2019, and the decade itself. Does it live up to the hype? The answer is an enthusiastic yes.Parasite is one of the best independent films I've ever seen. It's a textbook example of how to take a small idea, and a modest script, with limited locations and launch them all into the stratosphere. Without giving too much away, it centers around two families on opposite sides of the Korean social class. The ultra rich, elite class and the poor. The poor family devises an elaborate scheme to work as servants for the rich family, in the hopes that they can take a taste of aristocratic life, and work their way up the ladder. All is well, until they discover something underneath the house. A third class of servitude is revealed. A class more destitute and subservient to the rich family than the poor family could ever dream of. Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, Parasite serves as an allegory for income inequality and the ways in which the poorest classes of people are often exploited by the rich, with no thanks in return.The best horror films out there tell stories of larger meaning. They need to in order to be properly scary. Bong-Joon Ho allows his agenda to take shape throughout, but cleverly and gracefully, avoids being heavy-handed. For instance, there are no clear heroes and villains in his characters. To Ho, they are all victims of a larger societal struggle. In terms of its visual scope, Parasite is a masterclass in production design and framing. Instantly, the luxurious Park residence has become an iconic backdrop in film history. It's spacious rooms and narrow hallways paint a chilling picture of the enormity of wealth. The large screen door leading to the front yard is reminiscent of a large film screen, almost designed to showcase the importance of the Park family household. At 135 minutes, Parasite tells it's story as fitfully as a best-selling novel. In the end, you don't leave Parasite having missed the point of having watched it. It's satisfying, minute to minute. That's what makes this a great film.\"],\n",

       " [\"I'm going to start this film review by saying that this film was amazing in so many different ways, so many different aspects really shone, from the; cinematography, acting, pacing in the narrative, etc, it was really a very impressive film, overall. I really do wish I had watched this film earlier, however I do think I am going to rewatch this film to just really understand the depth and layers of the different characters, the different aspects of the narrative, and the duality in the cinematography between the rich and the poor.Firstly I wanted to talk about the beautiful visual aspects of this film, as since it is a film that isn't in English, and non English speaking films, in the past, have tended to find it hard to gain traction. So the visual storytelling was something that needed to be able to explore and explain the story. The cinematography is subtle and effortless; in its use of focus, framing and composition, color palette, as well as its ability to create a duality in the poor and rich areas. There were some really amazing shots that never felt out of place for the tone it was setting throughout the film, they felt dynamic, varied, and was generally very effective in its visual storytelling. As I mentioned before, there is a visual duality in the houses of the two families, this film utilized the two differing environments to its fullest potential, further accentuating the differences. The rich family's house had nature, open spaces, and was above the ground, which can't be said for the poor family's home which was urban, tight, and half underground with their natural sunlight coming from a window that is privy to drunk people. I also couldn't help but notice that the rich house was more intense in its brightness, and as we as the audience followed our protagonists into the poor area we descended more into the darkness, which is quite astounding and this film is full of these visual storytelling techniques adding to the beauty of it...I love films like these where the stories are compact and every single shot, that makes a sequence, that makes a scene, has meaning and adds to the narrative, pushing it forward. The beginning of the film sets up everything that the story relies and builds upon; the poorer family lives in the underground of society where they are almost left to rot and perish, scrounging for anything they can get their hands on, as opposed to the rich family who live very comfortably, with not a care in the world, oblivious and disgusted by the poor, who, to them, are a completely different species. As the film title implies, the poor family becomes the parasite sucking everything they can out of the rich family, but it turns out there is already a parasite present, which creates that conflict and makes for an amazing story. Seeing these 2 'parasites' fight for their host is so interesting as it explores the vast difference in the mindset of the 2 families, the poorer one showcasing their desperation for this life that the richer family lives so obliviously.There was some excellent acting in this film, the cast was brilliant, I thought that they didn't just play, but they actually embodied those characters. The actress who played the mother of the rich household, Cho Yeo-Jeong, I thought was amazing. That oblivious nature of the rich is perfectly embodied by her. Another performance that I thought really stood out was the performance of Choi Woo-Sik, who played Ki Woo, the son of the poor family. I thought he brought his character through a nice arc throughout the film. In a lot of the scenes he was in, his character's thought processes were subtle yet obvious enough for the audience to acknowledge, which was very nice to see. Those two performances stood out to me but that's not to say the rest of the cast was less, they were amazing...\"],\n",
       " [\"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-Ho, is a dark satirical film on wealth and inequality. The low-class families in the film are much like parasites, forced to feed off others in order to survive. However, like with parasites, the Kim family couldn't help but to gluttonously take advantage of their situation until the only way out was through drastic measures. What I found most interesting however, is the end of the film. The son seems to have a change of heart, and decided to create his own fortune rather than rely on others. Wether or not he succeeds in this is up for debate, but I found that to be a twist on the movie that really made me think.\"],\n",

We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want.

Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot, but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold.Firstly, the writing is incredible. What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty, changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected, interesting and absolutely brilliant. The pacing is on point and from start to finish, the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including, but not limited to: sadness, a feeling of well-deserved success, hapiness, guilt, unease, discomfort and fear.Secondly, the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more. For example, the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down.Finally, the ending is absolutely wonderful, although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie. After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending, but they did, and it was not what I expected. Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn\\'t neccesarily feel right.

       " [\"There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had.\"],\n",

       " [\"I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.Subpar.\"],\n",

In a dire situation, Mr. Park shut his nose because of the smell of Mr. Kim, this truly made a realization to Mr. Kim of the type of people they are.

Sorry folks, rich people are not that stupid.The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz. The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration. This film is nothing but pure fantasy.The ending where the daughter dies but not the son, reminded me of the ending of The Host. In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother. The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a messier finale.The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house is quite stupid and does not make any sense. It\\'s more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film.The movie kinda fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people in this film are more likeable than the poor. You can\\'t help rooting for the rich folks because they\\'re the victims although if you\\'re one of those antifa types you will most likely disagree.The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle. It has been replaced by the \"Let\\'s Get Rich\" mentality.

Their underground \"apartment\" does stink and yes, bad enough, they have to look at a drunken guy pee in front of them during dinner. No job, no hope, no direction, the bland and quiet acceptance of their status quo at the beginning makes me wonder how they resonate with the film title.However, step by step, through perfect acting schemes, the well thought out ploys, they make a dream of living off of the Parks come true, thereby transforming themselves into parasites. Throughout the period when they enjoy the \"improving\" living standards: from eating in the dungeon to a treat dinner with the drivers, to the actual pizzas whose boxes they were making to earn bread and butter, etc. All this time I struggle with the heartbreaking fact that at least three parties (1) the Parks (2) the previous driver (3) the previous maid were all innocently suffering from the Kims\\' wrongdoing. The lack of apologetic thinking is absolutely horrifying. Yet when the class difference is so drastic, I am not sure whether they are too be judged. After all what other options do they have, without a morally sound means to access anything else other than their smelly dungeon? It only became more intense when the previous maid showed her true parasitic self, together with her husband.\"Money is an almighty iron that straightens out all wrinkles\" - on the surface yes, but it is exactly this dangerous, monotonic pursuit of money, and money only, that has cost three families their chance to make peace with what is given.\"People with money are always nice.\" It sounds almost absurd and I can think of millions of counterexamples, yet the director sets the story up exactly this way in the film. I think I dare thinking outside of the film context, it is rather that \"the people who do not have money sometimes cannot afford to be nice.\" Either way, when the cutoff of wealth is base-line subsistence, it is clear that dignity is at risk.What is the dad\\'s plan? It sounds like a family who are so good at planning \"scenes\" to act out in fact have not a clue about planning long term for their lives. Is planning also out of reach for a lot of the poor? It turns a bit positive when the boy sets himself a goal to one day make enough money to buy that mansion, but is that enough? Or is it rather another episode of self-deceiving wishful thinking only?'],\n",

I thought that was well done especially when you consider the flood is sewage water and it is destroying their basement apartment. The cinematography alone in this seen was astounding, with the shot of the flooded bathroom and Ki-Jung sat on top of an overflowing elevated toilet, smoking as the rest of the family home is ruined being a particular highlight.The first half almost feels like a heist movie with horribly corrupt intentions, before everything comes crumbling down just as the family become comfortable.If this ever gets a re release in cinemas I will absolutely go.

Idiots! That commentary was NOT subtle. It was obvious to the point of being ridiculous. Bong has made fools of you, although I don\\'t think that was his ultimate intention.

Ouch. Don\\'t get in this ruthless mean family\\'s way or you\\'ll be sorry.I am.I liked the movie\\'s opening shot. Painterly. Black writing appears on the right window pane of the Kim family\\'s semi-basement hovel. For a while, everything was going OK. I liked the first act. Then WTF. Talk about bad choices. What an artistic, intellectual, sense-and-sensibility nose dive.Tough to give this harsh and disappointing mean-spirited flick higher than a 7. Because even if I give it a 7 for FORM (nice production values, acting, and visuals, but an achievement of FORM at best only slightly better than the architectural quality of the deluxe modernesque house that PARASITE features as the main stage set of its story), I can\\'t give the movie\\'s STORY more than a 6.Which averages a FORM & STORY score of 6.5.That\\'s about where it left me when I left the theater: pleased on an emotional and artistic level about 6.5, a bad taste in my mouth, feeling played. But at least I know what all the hyperventilating groupthink hype\\'s about.But then the filmmaker didn\\'t give himself the awards. The overblown fanfare isn\\'t his fault. He just wrote, directed, and made the best movie he could.And a 6.5 isn\\'t a bad score or in any way derogatory in my book, especially for a story that feels like a stage play more than a motion picture. For me, any movie that gets a 7 is darn good.So. Enjoy. See PARASITE over and over if it\\'s your cuppa tea and you find the movie relevant to your life, your vision of the world, your artistic aspirations and work. Different strokes for different folks.But here\\'s the thing: Actually, all we know for sure is that PARASITE may not have been--and most likely wasn\\'t--the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters\\' first choice for Best Picture but somehow still managed to eke out a win for that misleading category. PARASITE may have merely been the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters\\' second and third place choice for Best Picture, thanks to the complex \"preferential ballot system\" (Google it), pushing PARASITE over the top to KO works that may have gotten more first place votes.How else can we characterize this non-transparent balloting paradigm, based on non-disclosure of the balloting results, than Fakery Afoot?Or to steal a line from THE GENTLEMEN, \"F*%@ery Afoot.\"The Academy won\\'t tell us the truth. How many first place votes did PARASITE get? How many first place votes did the other 8 nominated movies get? Why won\\'t the academy show us the math?We can handle the truth.Instead, the Academy treats us like sheep, preferring to keep us in the dark, misleading us, relying on our gullibility and the necessary illusion (as they see it, in their screwed up marketing way) that PARASITE was the top vote getter for #1 film.Maybe.But unlikely.I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.Truth be told, who knows (other than The Academy\\'s Threshold Guardians) how many other so-called Best Picture award winners since 2009, when the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to as many as 10, won an award not for what we\\'re led to believe, Best Picture, but for a category that would be more accurately named Top Consensus Picture.Or, oxymoronically (and moronically), Top Second and Third Place Picture.Or how about Most Preferred Picture.Academy Awards are a self-promotional corporate crap shoot, fueled by politics, social trends, self-interest, personal biases, PR, hidden agendas, mass mind meld, and money. PARASITE simply reflects the latest Academy enabled intellectually dishonest connection between the secret and screwy preferential balloting system results and the name of the award--the fake connection between what goes on behind the curtain and what goes on in front of the curtain in the merry land of Oz.In other words, to use an analogy: Like our federal elections for President, the Best Picture award doesn\\'t go to the popular vote winner. The award goes to the Electoral College winner. But in our elections for President, though we might not like the set up and feel it\\'s unfair, at least we know how the system works, it\\'s fully disclosed, and the vote tallies do not remain behind closed doors.My hunch?PARASITE, true to the meaning of the word, ironically enough, benefited by deriving nutrients at the expense of other movies.I suspect that PARASITE landed the award for Top Consensus Picture/Most Preferred Picture not by leading in the number of first place votes but by siphoning off lots of second and third and maybe even fourth and fifth place votes, thereby outflanking films of more surpassing quality like LITTLE WOMEN (8.0) and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (8.75).Again, I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.Show us the math.I don\\'t know which force-feeds us a bigger Monster In The House, PARASITE or The Academy of Motion Pictures.At least PARASITE\\'s ugly monster roams the house out in the open.(Aside: For Best International Film, PARASITE oddly beat out the brilliantly written, shot, and acted, truly modern and original, artistically and socially astute no-false-note gritty LES MISERABLES (8.5). I haven\\'t yet seen Almodovar\\'s PAIN AND GLORY, also nominated for Best International Film, but I\\'m guessing I\\'ll like that more than PARASITE too. And, by the way, how did the Academy manage to overlook the remarkable unnominated edge-of-your-seat film-wonder UNCUT GEMS (8.5)--too cutting edge? Not good enough to make the empty 10 slot? Really? And you got robbed Adam Sandler.)PARASITE not only trots its monster, the downtrodden Kim family, out in the open, painting the family with a thin brush, hiding nothing, and therefore leaving little if anything surprising to foreshadow, reveal, or shock us about their inner life, history, motivations and what makes them tick besides inept pizza box folding, manipulation, high jinks, and greed.PARASITE also does another thing really well, which goes hand-in-glove with the story\\'s two-dimensional nefarious family. PARASITE reminds us that pressure reveals character--and the arc of the parasitic self-serving Kim family\\'s character is simple.None.Nasty family starts out F\\'d and poor. Nasty family hits the jackpot through fakery and fraud but hits a snag. Nasty family turns violent then becomes poor again and more F\\'d than before.Unrepentant.Unchanged.And all an empty way for the filmmaker to set us up for some nasty, gratuitous horror and gore.I was almost ready to accept the poor family\\'s mooching off the rich family as an inspired metaphor for capitalism mooching off society, doing whatever it takes, including lie, cheat, steal, smile, swindle, and kill, to parasitically feast off our commonwealth.But then capitalism wouldn\\'t likely end up back in the basement............One final thought. PARASITE tells a story about rich and poor that goes beyond the obvious economic one.The story takes place mostly inside of a house. A house is a metaphor for human character: Character is a house. You have your interior and exterior. I speak as an architect when I say that in terms of the quality of architectural design, the house has a rich, developed interior but a poor, undeveloped exterior. And I speak as a screenwriter when I say it\\'s the opposite for the quality of the character design: PARASITE\\'s characters have a rich, developed exterior but a poor, undeveloped interior. They are little more than paper-thin characterizations.The movie\\'s building architecture and character architecture are reciprocally related, creating a kind of symmetry, conflict, clash but not a pleasing kind--because in Story Architecture, what matters most isn\\'t the quality of the stage set design but the quality of the character design. And that\\'s where PARASITE fails most glaringly as a work of art.The filmmaker created a monster, patching together a subpar exterior building architecture and subpar interior character architecture to create a FORM & STORY 6.5 Frankenstein.'],\n",

I was not sleepy, just fed up with watching it.)The major flaw in the plot, as I see it, is that 4 extremely capable and adaptable people are living in an basement, starving and struggling to survive. Another thing is that the husband of the first housekeeper would have died starving in the bunker, without even attempting to go out and get himself some food, despite the fact he was not locked in, if his wife had not showed up after many days to check up on him, finding him all weak and hungry. And how did Chung-sook manage to clear all the mess so that the Parks did not notice anything if not when they arrived then when they woke up in the morning?The movie has quite a suspenseful plot, nicely done, but asides from that it is just not entertaining enough. And here I found myself divided, on one side really wanting to see what is going to happen, and on the other side just dying from boredom because despite of all of the happenings it is simply just not entertaining.As for the cinematography, I liked the movie.

They struggle to retain what most would consider basic necessity nowadays like wifi, and do odd jobs to regain that and have a simple meal.Fortune strikes though as their son gets an in with a rich family to tutor their young daughter, eventually working their way deeper inside until all four are working different jobs for this family.All this is achieved because the mother is easily manipulated and prefers recommendations when bringing workers into their home, rather than documentation. This ties into the difference between classes.However, our main families newfound means of financial potential is put in jeopardy one night when the former house cleaner returns. She rings incessantly, needing to retrieve something in the basement. Which we find out is her husband, revealing the main family is not the first to get an in with the rich family. Her husband had actually been living there for years to escape loan sharks, and was receiving food and residency unbeknownst to the family above.The raised issue of these two different families leeching from the wealthier comes to a head when the rise is discovered by the former housekeeper. She and her husband are subdued and shortly after our family, save for the mother, is able to sneakily escape.This leads to a brilliant scene of our family descending back into poverty.

       " [\"Asian films are not the most frequent guests on our screens, and, probably, the main reason for this is a significant difference in the perception of the world and mentality between East and West, which is eventually reflected in cinema as a special kind of art. Despite the abundance of awards, primarily in Western cinema (4 Oscars, and 1 in the main nomination), the viewer, accustomed to Western cinema clearly divided into genres, will not be easy to watch this film. In terms of belonging to the genre, I would call 'Parasite' a tragicomedy of situations built on the grotesque, and this combination can hardly be called common and easy to understand. The film is informative, which is quite important, in my opinion. It is felt that the director of the film, Bong Joon-ho, did his best. There is an academic sequence and a competent style of presentation of the plot. There is a plot, which occupies most of the tape, and then - the climax and denouement, which is devoted to about the second half of the picture. That is, there is something to see, and it is felt.Let's look at the plot of this movie in order.The Kim family is on the brink of survival. They live by part-time jobs, stealing Wi-Fi from their neighbors. In fact, parents have a profession, but for some reason they do not want to work in it or cannot - this is not disclosed. Children seem to be supposed to study, but the boy did not go to college, and about the girl it's completely strange.So, it all starts with the guy's friend offering him his job as a tutor for the duration of his internship. The first question is why forge documents if you have already been recommended? The final decision still takes place after an open lesson in the presence of my mother. Question two - why lie that this is not your sister, but some distant acquaintance? Perhaps some kind of Korean mentality is manifested in this. But if the owners are not against nepotism and recommendations, then I see no reason to invent something.The moment when the hostess leaked the driver in the end is not disclosed. This is a blatant failure in the script. But it is very well shown how a simple housewife can wind up a problem out of nothing, but then it is doubly strange why she does not use the services of trusted agencies. Especially, they are not cut off from society, but are friends with the same families and, for sure, exchange experiences. Plus, accepting a person into a family without a total check is like walking through a minefield. Silly and pointless. Especially when the husband is the head of an IT corporation, and it is easy for him. And it's easy to check the former driver for drugs, and you can simply reprimand him with a warning for having fun with a girl. In short, the film's credibility is seriously lame.Nevertheless, the nature of people is well revealed, who not only could not honestly get a job, but also began to feel like masters there. Fighting for their place, they were ready for a lot. After all, they did not want to return to their basement stinking life.I honestly feel sorry for the Pack family, who just wanted peace and quiet in the house. But with the staff they were totally unlucky. I would like to see the scene of their lives after the events that happened, how it all affected them. But we have only seen the last of the parasite family. The sad events nevertheless gave them an impetus to take up their minds and at least somehow take care of each other.Separately, I will speak about the Pakov house. This is an absolutely uncomfortable place, which is absolutely not suitable for a family with a child, but looks great on the screen. The housing of such wives is always decorated with something smoother, softer - after all, she bought a wigwam for a child, and carried it out onto the lawn. As if there is a separate world that does not fit into their house. The lawn was again decorated for the child's birthday. And the interiors remained with cold textures and clear lines.Yes, the script is interesting, dynamic and at the same time quite cruel, with unusual twists - this is a plus. A summary of this phenomenon and gaps that can be closed, just a little more screen time. Also a clear musical accompaniment, which is successfully accepted.Is this movie worth watching? Definitely yes, if you have a desire to look at the social problems of the modern world from an unexpected angle. What's more, the music, the beautiful interiors, the bright, heroic camera work, the lively atmosphere and the lust for profit make this film a serious challenge to yourself and ask yourself the question: 'Are you a parasite?'\"],\n",
       " ['Parasite is a monumental picture that changed the perception of foreign films forever. It was less of a film, and more of an experience. Bong Joon-ho has created yet another masterpiece that will never leave your mind. Everyday you learn new things and immaculate details about the film that you never noticed, such as his use of lines throughout the film to represent the split in class and \"crossing the line\". His attention to detail is a huge factor in why this movie is so beautiful, but his knowledge of Korean culture and social class is what really makes this film outstanding. Knowing that the film is an accurate representation of the class structure in Korea is a huge eye-opener to those from other countries.The greatest part about this film though, is that it speaks to everyone in some way. To Koreans and even other parts of Asia, it\\'s great Asian representation in the media and especially the film industry, considering how well it did. To film lovers, it\\'s a combination of immaculate details and concepts put together in beautiful shots and scripts. To other viewers, it\\'s a great tragic/comedy/thriller full of many twists and turns, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Parasite connects many different people and cultures through marvellous story telling. Their strive for what could possibly be seen as the \"American Dream\" certainly connects to a younger audience who have the same goals; Go to a great school, get a well-paying job, get rich and start a family. Teens who have been raised to strive for those same goals in life (including myself) can relate to their struggles to reach that goal, which is almost impossible. The acting in this film is impeccable. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik are such a powerful duo and bring light to their characters. Yet again, the performance by Kang-Ho Song is outstanding. His exemplary portrayal of a Korean father trying to take care of a struggling family while saving face is accurate and beautifully done.Parasite is exactly like it\\'s name. It catches you off guard, infects your brain and never leaves it. This film is something that\\'s never been done before. Breaking records, shaking up the film community and making a huge name for itself. Parasite has completely changed the game and set a huge bar not only for future korean films, but for future films in general. Bong Joon-ho is a master of his craft and I cannot wait for his next film.'],\n",
       " [\"The title caught me off guard..is it a horror film? Suspense? Not fully knowing what to expect..sets up Parasite perfectly! I was reminded what quality film making and storytelling was about. Each scene layer on top of the next like a fitted-suit. You connected with each character as if you knew them. Plot twists and turns smorgasbord built to a thunderous crescendo. The movie is deep! We're all parasites..using the class above or below. Korea's changing the game.\"],\n",

Everything from the transition from a lighthearted introduction to a thriller drama, the directing, the intricate storyline (notice how connected everything is - really shows great scriptwriting), the reversal of roles and even the lumming existence of reality...I could go on for HOURS. To keep a long story short, this movie was SPECTACULAR. Do not shy away from this movie. The Academy has done something right.'],\n",
       " ['It is understood that Hollywood wanted to attract more costumers in Asia by handing this movie Oscars\\' Best Picture and Best Directing. I can\\'t see how this movie surpasses \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" or \"Irishman\" in terms of the acting. This movie is average at best. The suspense is average (not better than \"Knives Out\"). The thrill is cheap. The cinematography is average. Too much implausibility. \"Marriage Story\" is even more entertaining that this movie.'],\n",

This film shows an excessive amount of multilayered symbolism and all the ideologies portrayed in the film mainly revolved around the central idea of class distinction. At first glance, the theme may seem quite simple,, but then you start to understand the true nature of the film. The film is filled with finesse in terms of direction. Every little thing has a meaning behind it and all the credit goes to the director ( Bon joon ho) for depicting things so beautifully. The title,\"parasite\", suggest how a parasite ( in the film- underclassmen) devours the host. But the movie shows how even in something so nether there are feelings and emotions present. The part where the blood falls onto the pale bread is a masterpiece in my opinion as it perfectly summarizes the movie and it has such depth of meaning behind it. I was trying not to give away too much and that is the reason the review seems quite awkward but honestly, i do not words to describe Bon Joon ho\\'s depth of thought and make sure you add this film in your watch list right now.'],\n",

       " ['Without giving away any major plot points Parasite can only be described as one of the most unmistakable yet subtle pieces of social commentary of the 21st century.

It's so incredibly tense and it's almost like watching a stage play at times\\n3) The film gets you fully invested in the characters and the plot and had me on the edge of my seat for a lot of it\\n4) Fully deserved that this is the film to make history by being the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the OscarsNEGATIVES:1) I find the first half of the film to be a bit of a slog. Everything prior to the old housekeeping showing up in the middle of the night feels too slow paced for me. I also find it quite unbelievable how easy it was for our lead characters to wiggle their way into the lives of the rich family\\n2) Right as the film is working amazingly and at an incredibly high point for tension, it completely undercuts itself by going off on a weird side plot where the family's home is flooded and they have to go and live in a gymnasium. I get the idea of this was probably supposed to be to illustrate how poor they are in comparison to the rich family they have infiltrated, but it just felt like an unnecessary lengthening of the runtime to me\\n3) The ending is an issue for me.

       " [\"The truth is that the movie is about not 2 but 3 different class of society.\\nThe Parks: the true upper class..Represented by wealth....huge house.... Abundance of sunlight... concerned with only First world problems...The Kims: the lower middle class... represented by unemployment.... Half basement house....lack of sunlight... Concerned only with their struggle for better lifestyle...The Ohs: the true lower class... Represented by hunger.... Deep basement..... Absolutely no sunlight... Concerned only with their survival....For the first half of the movie, we see only two classes, Parks and Kims and it shows how Kims are leaching on to Parks for their well being like a Parasite...But later when the third class is introduced as Ohs, audience begin to believe that actually Ohs are true Parasite as they offer nothing in return to Parks for what they steal..As we approach the final quarter, when the **** hits the fan....the perspective is switched again to show that Parks, the luxury class, are the true Parasite, they depend on the society for their lifestyle and pleasures but don't even give respect to the once they depend on. This is the true revelation.The movie brilliantly shows how cruel is each class towards other. Pay attention to how the Kims react when they find out their is another class below them. They also show no sympathy to Ohs and they hurt them and leave them to die of hunger. (As depicted in No plan is the plan scene).Another thing to pay attention is the scholar's rock, it is truly metaphorical as it is a symbol of hope, as shown in the scene it was introduced. Ki-Woo shown to be always hopeful as he is shown clinging on to the rock even when their whole house is flooded and they are turned homeless overnight and in the end it this rock (hope) that hurts him the most and yet he is hopeful that one day he will buy the house to free up his dad.This capitalistic world is at balance when each class is happy with where they are but it starts trembling down when the lower classes try to move up the social ladder.\\nThe scene where the Kims get taste of upper class luxury is where it starts to get ugly and when the true lower class try to rise the whole society shambles. Ultimately everyone loses something. Lowest classes losing everything (the couple dies), Middle loses half of what they have ( the daughter dies and father is imprisoned) and the upper class only loses a quarter of their family.This movie has so many layers and so much depth, it is best understood if you watch it three times from three different perspective of each class.\"],\n",
       " [\"Parasite was one of the best films of 2019. It engaged the audience by building tension slowly throughout the first half, then having everything come crashing down throughout the second half, as if in slow-motion. One of my favourite aspects of this was that, as Mr. Kim says in the latter half of the film, there was no plan to their actions. This way, the audience doesn't know what's happening until it's over, and that might suggest that the Kims don't either. Still, the rush that I felt when I figured out pieces of their plan is difficult to find in most films. Two examples of this are when Mr. Kim poured the hot sauce onto the tissue, to trick Mrs. Park into firing her housekeeper under suspicion of tuberculosis, or later in the film when they hide under the table from the Park family. I'm pretty sure I audibly gasped when Mr. Kim lifted up the tissue with 'blood' on it.\\nAn important thing to note is that the film, though made in Korea, represents the futility of the American Dream in a way that I've never seen before. When I say 'American Dream', I mean the ideal that if you work hard enough, you can become rich and successful. Both the Kims and the Parks, I would say, are living in fantasy worlds of this ideal. The Parks believe that they've worked hard to get where they are, and therefore deserve household employees who don't smell like a basement. The Kims, on the other hand, hold the belief that working hard will someday get them where the Parks are, figuratively and literally. No one believes this more strongly than Ki-woo, the son of the Kim family. This is shown throughout the film, from even before he first gets the job as an English tutor, when he's trying to get a job with the pizza delivery driver. Once he gets the job, he believes it's his way out and he can save enough money for college. The worst part about this is that he still holds this belief at the very end of the movie, when he writes a letter (that he has absolutely no way to send) to his dad. The letter describes this exact ideal; if Ki-woo works hard and goes to university and makes money, he can buy the house his father is hiding in, and literally be where the Parks were at the start. Since he's already been rejected from college multiple times, and South Korean real estate is crazy expensive, it would be impossible for him to achieve this goal, but he still believes he can. This is, in my opinion, the saddest part of the movie. Since this is how it ends, it leaves the viewer contemplating whether he could actually achieve his dream of saving his father, which makes the film much more powerful.\"],\n",

       " ['Although Bong Joon-Ho\\'s American movies have been subpar, his Korean movies still continue to be must see, especially on the big screen. His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at. Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background, which most certainly was not put there by accident. If you have seen Joon-Ho\\'s other film, you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts.\\nHonestly, this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it. I can\\'t stop thinking about all the excitement, agony, disturbance, turmoil, and sorrow that was brought upon me. Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters. It certainly deserves the Palme d\\'Or (I haven\\'t seen The Lighthouse yet) and all the praise that comes with it. I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I\\'m most certain it won\\'t because it\\'s an international film (bunch of cowards).\\nThis film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs. the poor (a common theme for Korean movies). At the beginning, the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people. Later on, after making money beyond their wildest dream, they slowly started to change. For example, before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house, they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be. After the money had been rolling in, they decided that they had enough \"status\" to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out. Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image.\\nMy favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette. For some reason that scene just resonates with me. She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded. Her home, the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone. So she sits there on top of a toilet that\\'s now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste. She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard.\\nThe dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film. He had for the longest time, wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him.\\nFrom what I just said above, I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house. Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status. The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes. The son, after he gets out of the hospital, went back to the house to check on, I presume, the girl. They are all drawn to the place.\\nAs a cinephile, I was pleased to go into this blind. The less you know, the better and the more suspense you will feel. There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act. The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone.\\nThe only drawback I have for the US release is, the film was very limited in my area. It wasn\\'t too bad for me but from what I read, other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away. I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films, but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it.'],\n",
