      "A modern day masterpiece. There is really no movie that is so funny, however, so moving at the same time. A true cultural masterpiece that puts political correctness to shame. We are all equal and Gran Torino does a fine job of letting us know. One of Clint Eastwood's greatest. Acting and directing. 0.20151515151515154\n",
      "I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again! -0.055548611111111125\n",
      "As Clint Eastwood reaches the end of his life, he presents us with yet another performance which is nothing short of legendary. Wishing to preserve the element of surprise, I will not reveal anything by trying to analyse this great work of art.I will say this. There are similar qualities to his previous work, but I would say that both his directing and acting have reached a level of maturity comparable to that of an excellent wine. The story was compelling and, mixed with the drama was a refined touch of humour; the perfect combination for a pleasant evening.I would like to finish by thanking Mr. Eastwood for sharing this touching moment with his audience at a time when most of the cinematic \"art\" produced in Hollywood consists of stunts and bad jokes. 0.3311111111111111\n",
      "I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich. Similarly, he has little patience with his two sons, Mitch and Steve, and their families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Walt's sons see him as \"always disappointed\" with them and their families, unaware of their obnoxiousness. Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors, a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue, live with their widowed mother and grandmother. The Hmong gang, at that point, tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery, pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days, Spider and his gang return. With Sue at his side, Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail. The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him. His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts. The conflict ends when Walt, who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division, threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn. They leave the neighborhood, telling Walt to watch his back.After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers, while her \"date\" cannot help her, Walt steps in to rescue her, confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol. Sue gets to know Walt, and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday, bringing him closer to her family, explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on \"his\" side. Sue, Thao, and their mother visit Walt the next day, with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino. Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men. Meanwhile, the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them. But when he refuses, the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment, he wants justice.I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it, it has terrific performances and a touching story. I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt, he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated. It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together, they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one. I think down the line, Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic, this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise.9/10 0.09026126651126652\n",
      "I saw Gran Torino mainly as an admirer of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and as director. And I was very impressed, there were parts that amused me and others that had me moved. Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie. In regard to the acting, Clint Eastwood gives a very commanding performance and the kids are also very good mostly. Overall, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox 0.2980952380952381\n",
      "Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both. 0.14381720430107528\n",
      "This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The \"olidish\" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now. 0.18854166666666666\n",
      "Although I am a big fan of Eastwood and have enjoyed most of his films, I found Gran Torino to be overly sentimental and I'm confused by the high IMDb rating. The plot thread is almost banal - why would the tough Asian gang devote so much effort in pursuit of the teenage boy who did not want to be a member? and lacked credibility - the sick old man was able to intimidate these gang members? and is too familiar - hardened racist comes around, honorable man sacrifices his life for justice and absolves himself of past sins through his last actions on earth, etc., etc. And I disagree with the comment that viewers were permitted to 'make up our own minds'. In this film, the moral of the story was in the viewer's face and an emotional response was overtly solicited. Compared to Unforgiven, a film that was both powerful and subtle, and avoided obvious moral judgments, Gran Torino is an amateurish piece. 0.007939682539682545\n",

      "First of all, don't assume that I am trying to discourage you from seeing this movie by giving it a relatively low score. As escapist entertainment, it works very, very well. Just don't let the fact that this movie uses some politically incorrect and downright racist language that comes from the mouth of someone who turns out to have a heart of gold and comes to love the objects of his racism con you into thinking there is any great depth to this movie. There isn't. Depicting an oddball and a dinosaur who turns out to be able to learn things and teach things may be entertaining, but unless it brings something new to the table, it isn't philosophy. This is a movie about redemption, but in the end, the main character, who is initially depicted as a thinker and a secretly religious man, claims redemption and salvation by denying all hope of redemption and salvation to other (admittedly evil) characters. For me, this just didn't work and the contradiction ruined the movie for me. The character just would not have done that. He was neither stupid nor selfish.Clint Eastwood turns in a great performance. Nobody else did, although most carried their part competently. I genuinely enjoyed this film while I was watching it. get it on DVD. 0.1660016835016835\n",
      "I'm from the industrial Midwest, and I've known a lot of Walt Kowalskis. Grizzled, white ethnic old-timers who are not PC, whose cars are their first love, and who bemoan the loss of \"their\" neighborhoods, and \"their\" city. I've also known a fair number of kids like Thao, Hmong-American kids trying to make it in a world their parents do not understand. I've known neighborhoods like Walt's: neighborhoods in transition that show signs of decay, but are still lived in and tended to by hard working old timers like Walt and their hard-working immigrant neighbors, whom they don't understand and paint with a broad brush as \"the other.\" I was excited to watch Gran Torino because of the rave reviews and its portrayal of this world of which I am so familiar. Sadly, while I appreciated the premise, and was happy to see so many Hmong actors in Hmong roles (rather than \"professional\" non-Hmong Asian actors playing these roles), the movie came up short. I found the dialogue and characters to lack credibility, and the plot too cliché-ridden to be taken seriously.The theme of death and rebirth, brought to us mainly through the fraught relationship of Walt and the young priest, had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer(Did Walt HAVE to come to rest in a Christ-like pose after the shooting in the last scene?! Puh-leeeze.) The \"death-as-sad-and-happy\" thing just never really connected with the larger message of the movie of \"learning to love thy neighbor.\"I will cite one example of a relatively minor scene that illustrates this movie's larger problems: In real life, white boys who try to be \"down with the 'hood,\" don't say \"it's all good, bro!\" to some gangbanger they don't know after said gangbanger hits on their girlfriend. Maybe in a movie like \"Strait Outta Malibu\" could that scene have worked, but in this context it was ridiculous and totally not-believable. This seemingly minor miscue threw so much of the movie off, because we're forced to conclude from it that Sue's boyfriend is mentally ill, and if that's the case, what does that say about Sue herself, who is one the most important drivers of the plot? Overall, this film suffers from too many cliché characters and too many cliché plot points to really be anything more than an average movie. Which is a shame, because it could have been so much more, and was a great opportunity for the wider world to get to know the Hmong people and their story. 0.14670893719806766\n",
      "If Clint Eastwood had retired after Gran Torino, it might have been one of the most perfect endings to an iconic actor's career. Walt Kowalski is like Harry Callahan or number of Eastwood characters from his past only, like the vessel they're protrayed through, older. He's the crusty, cynical tough-guy who deep inside is a bit softer and has a warmer than you'd expect heart. Which is the truth we see revealed in Kowalski over the course of this movie as he befriends and helps the Hmong kid next door. There might be enough of these movies to constitute an entire subgenre of friendship films: one involving an older guy who learns a little about life while teaching a boy to be a man. It's a friendship story and even what you'd call a feel-good one despite the violence and negativity surrounding it. The film aims for authenticity though I think bits of it will be seen by posterity as dated, false hollywood depictions.Maybe the later movies kept him busy but this is where Eastwood's career as an actor should have (and in a sense did) end. 0.06223958333333334\n",
      "If there's any Clint Eastwood film that sums up his 'jack of all trades' reputation, then this one has got to be it. There's nothing that the guy doesn't do, and this peculiar yet powerful character study is the perfect example of that. 'Gran Torino' is a very smart and hugely enjoyable drama film with a brilliant ending that tops off what is a truly great story.It is a story built on characters and friendship where you would least expect to find it. The character development is excellent, and rarely will you find such a convincing and diverse bunch of characters that work so well together. The film's strength is definitely in its simplicity, with the stripped back, raw approach complementing the storyline perfectly. 'Gran Torino' is an impressive character-driven drama with a memorable ending. 0.44398836457659985\n",

      "A very good Eastwood movie, both in terms of performance and direction by the man himself. It has, I think, a great message about today's youth, the values that society used to hold, back when men used to be men, about redemption and about judging other people by the content of their character, rather than the color of their skin. The only thing I see holding down this otherwise great film, is sometimes the dialogue of the film and the stereotypes that the family of Eastwood's character plays are a little too \"on the nose\". The family, for example, filled with ungrateful people with no values whatsoever who are only interested in what will happen to Walt's possessions as soon as he dies, often seem caricatures, characters overly simplified in order for the message to come across that they are soulless creatures and to place the emphasis that Walt comes to value and grow a much better relationship with his Asian neighbors, despite all of his initial racism and prejudice towards them. But putting that aside, Gran Torino is truly a very good film, perhaps one of Eastwood's best. 0.3188715277777778\n",
      "Clint Eastwood is one of my all time heroes both as an actor and as a director so I was really looking forward to watching this film in which he does both jobs. He also has a knack for depicting the crack in the American dream as illustrated by Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The Unforgiven, and so forth -- but this time the whole thing appeared to be more about racist Paleface Clint becoming a better person than anything else, so I came away somewhat disappointed.In what might well be Clint's final acting performance (he is beginning to look old and creaky) I witnessed a rehash of all the Dirty Harry and man with no name stuff under the guise of an old man who seemingly cares for no one and is tough as nails but underneath is a real softy. He retains all his well established celluloid courage as an old dog of war that keeps the young and fit criminals in their place.The way he wins over the Asian neighbors that he keeps insulting and turning away really stretches your imagination. But at least the intention is good and it is refreshing to see his exchanges with the untiring Catholic priest who does his utmost to get him to confess and save his soul.In a finale reminiscent of John Wayne in \"The Shootist,\" Clint commits public suicide and apparently places his faith with a number of witnesses that had up to that point been very wary to report anything on the criminal gangs for fear of retribution. Personally, I thought it a pointless suicide. I'd much rather have seen Clint go out blasting away and taking with him a few bad eggs. But that is my obviously very subjective viewpoint.I am giving this film a 7 but 6.5 would be closer to the mark. May Clint live many more years and direct many more great films. This one and The Changeling have provided blips on the lower side of the quality graph but they are still well worth admission price.And - I'm sure Clint will bounce back with more quality films in the near future! 0.09994846423417851\n",

If I could, i'd wage war against the injustices of the world, but I'm just one little man. I have little sympathy for idiots, but I understand that each person's situation is different and I try to remember that.This movie inspires me to remember that, while I can't change the entire screwed up world, I can at times make a small difference in the life of another person, and that difference can multiply itself into real change in the world. Kindness is contagious.I try to learn something and take something away from everything I watch, and there is a lot to take away from this movie.

      "The 4 stars are solely for Eastwood's performance, which was top notch as usual. He is like a fine wine, he only gets better.... As for the rest of the movie, a couple of other reviewers have nailed it, but the multitude of people that gave it anywhere from 9 to 10 stars saw a different movie from me. The rest of the acting in the movie is honestly the worst I can remember seeing in a movie. There are times when there is maybe one actor in a movie who is not very polished, but in this movie, there are actor after actor, scene after scene, where aside, from Clint, I thought I was watching a middle school production. And it wasn't ONLY the acting. The dialogue for a large part of the movie was also very forced, unrealistic, and staged. Not great writing here folks. There are a few rewarding moments, and again, Clint's acting and character are superb, but that is not enough to recommend this amateurish, predictable, and pretty unrealistic movie. -0.0031128747795414477\n",

      "Now I understand why Clint Eastwood took over the directorial reins for Changeling from Ron Howard. (Howard dropped Changeling in order to make Frost/Nixon, instead.)Eastwood did an excellent job on Changeling, with a genuine feel for the dark subject matter, and guided Angelina Jolie to one of the best performances of her career, to date, significantly expanding her dramatic range.The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year, GRAN TORINO, was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial, since all of the Hmong cast are first-time actors, who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood, even with Eastwood helming and starring. (The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished.) In casting, Eastwood didn't want \"thespians.\" He wanted an honest exactness of performance.While I really like and respect Changeling, I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably *not* the best film of this year, but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention.GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry, culture clash, political refugee immigration/resettlement (and, by way of that, US foreign policy) and Old School, Doing the Right Thing (vs today's more commonplace \"situational\" ethics). All of this rolled into two, parallel, coming of age stories, served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs, with the sting of truth, and are never too preachy. (Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers, always, without ever talking down.)One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid, Tao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang), a dirt-poor son of divorced Hmong immigrants (Vietnam war political refugees).Tao lives with his mother, sister and grandmother, next door to Walt Kowalski (Eastwood). Walt insists upon calling Tao, \"Toad\" (initially, with some good reason). Tao's sister, Sue, (a scene stealing Ahney Her), is spontaneously outgoing and engaging with Walt, and confides to Walt that Tao is growing up without any proper male role models in his life. In fact, Tao is in the midst of confronting the grim prospects of either being recruited into his bad-seed cousin's gang or becoming a permanent victim of said 'bangers.The less obvious coming of age story revolves around Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran. Walt's Polish ancestry seems to serve no purpose other than to establish him as \"ethnic\" white, living in a dog-eared neighborhood of ongoing immigration stories. Walt is a curmudgeon, who lacks basic \"people skills\" with even his own family, let alone the world around him. But he has managed his way though life, fine enough, up to the opening of the film's story.Just about every review I've read about GT describes Eastwood's Kowalski as a \"racist Korean War veteran,\" which misses one of the major points raised in the film -- that bigotry in the US is deeply ingrained in every niche of society. None of us is innocent or absolved of anything in this regard and the film is very frank about this point. Initially, this serves as nothing more than a source for shock humor, but Eastwood finds a way to subvert this into a message of tough-love hope.The gang life incursions into the story are very true to life. Gangs are always either recruiting new cannon fodder or marking new victims. If parents seeing this film had no clue about this, they ought to start finding ways to open up ongoing lines of discussion with their kids about what's really happening, day-to-day, at school, in the playground and elsewhere. Most of the time, kids like Tao, just internalize all of these pressures, hoping that they won't be picked on, and otherwise feeling powerless. None of us should ever kid ourselves about *all* kids, not just some kids, being \"at risk.\"(As for the non-white, poly-ethnicity of Kowalski's part of town, the disbelievers of the authenticity of that have only been exposed to the rarefied 'hoods of mainstream Hollywood. I can name any number of mid-to-small cities/towns where the exact mix and flavors in GT are very real. You don't have to live in a 'hood to pass through and/or stake out an occasional corner on which to hang. The Latino and black \"presence\" in the film never implied that they lived in that neighborhood, although they were obviously trolling for victims. Perps who don't intend to be caught *rarely* hunt in their own backyards.)Walt knows that he's dead set in his ways, not all of them \"bad,\" but not most of them \"good.\" Beyond the confines of his own property line, Walt may be a little more effective than Tao, out in the real world, but, he too is, in many ways, powerless to change the way most things are. Nevertheless, in getting to know Tao, Sue and the extended Hmong community to which the Lors belong, Walt discovers that his Fort Apache ways don't work anymore. Walt realizes that he has yet to finally come of age, too. (Some will call this \"atonement.\" I call it \"growing up, again, at 78.\" Both are spot on.)This film will make you laugh. It may even make you cry. But it might also make you think about some stuff you thought you were long ago done with thinking about.People at the screening I attended were so startled at the end that there was a significant moment of silence before applause finally broke out.GT is another lovely present from Clint Eastwood.

You can immediately see that he's a nasty old man who has little, if any, connection with his kids and grandkids (some of which ARE pretty unlikable). He also lives in a community that is now filled with Asians and Chicanos (and gangs) and he hates them—and they don't particularly like him either. At this point, it's hard to like the crusty old guy. He's nasty to the well-meaning priest that's trying to help him cope with the wife's death and he just wants everyone to leave him alone.Later, despite Eastwood's character wanting his privacy, he is forced to get involved—though it's NOT for altruistic reasons.

      "Review:Clint Eastwood performs a knock-out and surely Oscar worthy performance as a disgruntled Korean War vet called Walt Kowalski. The plot, though simple in substance and style is brilliantly planned and educated. The film follows a disgruntled Korean war veteran named Walt Kowalski, who sets out to reform his neighbour, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.Whilst both electric and brilliant, Eastwood fully acts his character to the bone and it shows that this is a character that has been perfectly created by Eastwood himself. Every aspect is detailed and visually amazing. Eastwood also shows us his dramatic and comedic side to Kowalski. The direction by Eastwood is powerful and imaginative which flows as boldly as the story. The backdrop to the film is mystic and thrilling as you don't now what's going to happen next, and Eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences on the edge.Verdict:Never since The Outlaw Josey Wales has Eastwood portrayed a character so thrilling and as exciting as Walt Kawolski. All in all this is a powerhouse performance which should get Easttwood an Oscar and a definite Director nod. 0.3616666666666667\n",
      "Gran Torino is a rather one dimensional vehicle for Clint Eastwood, who has been one of my favorite actors since Rawhide. I freely admit I was disappointed by it and I don't share the general adulation of other reviewers, amateur and professional.My viewing experience was also rather strange. At 53 I'm well used to being a very unimportant part of the demographic - I 'get' that I'm not supposed to be a movie fan. That important role is left to the 18 to 30 age group. (We'll ignore that I have 2 kids in that age category who go to the movies one tenth as often as I do",
      ") So finding myself in a movie theatre full of people far older than me was a slightly unnerving experience. And I haven't shared a movie viewing with such a vocal audience since Brokeback Mountain, and, just like BBM, the audience laughed heartily. I'm still digesting quite why. Gran Torino is mildly amusing in places but really, it's not that funny. It's tragic. The genuinely hearty laughter from the 'mature' audience at all the racist jokes left me mildly bemused.Eastwood plays embittered Korean War vet, and ex Ford car plant worker Walt, who has been recently widowed. He's being patronized by a wet-behind-the-ears young priest who promised his late wife that he'd keep an eye on Walt for her. He's hung on in the old neighborhood even as it's got rougher and tougher as various migrant groups have moved in, his family are pretty much waiting for him to die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are, and, the final insult for our politically incorrect hero, a family of Asians (Hmoung) live next door. And they are not heavily into lawn care. Walt pretty much thinks an Asian is an Asian and they're all equally undesirable as neighbours, after all he fought them in a war. He's an old school racist.When the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts  very ineptly  to steal Walt's muscle car, a '72 Ford Gran Torino, as part of a gang initiation he doesn't want to do, Walt gives him a series of chores as retribution, and a tentative father-son relationship ensues. Thao's brighter and westernised sister Sue (Ahney Her) becomes the conduit via which Walt and the neighbours start to interact. The point is somewhat labored that Walt lives alone, alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious, while the Hmoung all seem to live in one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting on the front porch. Walt digs out his old war weapon and chases off the gang when they harass Thao, thus becoming an unlikely neighbourhood hero. Grateful, they smother him with food and hospitality whether he wants it or not, but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead to tragedy. Alongside the story of Walt, the gang and his neighbours is the coming of age tale of the eager young priest (Christopher Carley), and Walt's failing health.So far so good. The movie isn't too badly written and its heart is in the right place. It seems a little out of date now  with the economy in freefall and construction jobs being shed faster than a Labrador's hair, I doubt Walt could really get a totally inexperienced kid a job on a building site no matter how well he knew the Irish foreman  and I found Walt's attempt to teach Thao 'manly' interaction at the barber's shop fairly excruciating  wherever these guys live it's apparently still 1957. Walt hates everyone including his own sons and grandchildren but the thought that they might have gained their family values from him never seems to occur to him.The cinematography is good with the house interiors, the neighbourhood, the yards and the church all looking genuinely authentic. But the movie sags in the middle and feels very contrived, all the characters are one dimensional and the acting is best described as adequate. If this were not Eastwood, and he were not 78, I doubt this would be scoring 8.5 out of 10 (as it is at the time of writing) on IMDb. In fact, I doubt it would have gotten made. It lacks any real bite, and is fairly predictable. It's not actively bad, but it's simply not as good as it could be or as many IMDb reviewers seem to think it is, and Eastwood is in danger of becoming a parody of himself. There is a level on which I think it appeals to the audience's basest instincts, and I'm still disquieted by all that hearty laughter from my cinema companions. But maybe it's me. 0.10714780075891187\n",

Sadly, Clint Eastwood is the only one on screen that keeps you from not walking away from it. Bee Wang and Ahney Her ,who are both totally unknown to me, both have major parts in this film.

He has recently lost his wife and doesn't have a close relationship to his sons. An Asian family moves next to Walt. At first he doesn't want anything to do with them. One night he sees Thao stealing his Gran Torino. He then chases Thao and the gang, who made Thao do it, of his lawn, thus earning the respect from his Asian neighbors. He then starts building up a relationship to his neighbors, even taking Thao under his wing. But the peace does not last long, as the gang seeks revenge.I like the movie very much. Clint Eastwood gives a wonderful performance, with also the supporting cast being brilliant. The story was excellent, showing how much a person can chance, when the prejudices are put aside. The screenplay was also surprisingly funny, especially Kowalski and Thao having On-Screen chemistry. The movie was directed very Eastwood-esk, often just taking two or three shots like in \"Mystic River\" or \"Million Dollar Baby\". The only downside of the movie is that some characters are a little bit clichéd.Overall I would recommend this movie to pretty much everyone, as the themes of racism and overcoming your prejudices affect all of us. 0.21535714285714289\n",
      "I am a Clint Eastwood fan, but not lately.He has decided to reveal a human side of himself - went to the Wizard and acquired a heart. He also revealed he is a wooden actor and a plodding, predictable director. Gran Torino is uninteresting at best and tedious at worst,worse even than Million Dollar Baby,and contains some of the worst actors ever subjected to the silver screen. I did enjoy the Christ-image at the end as he is sprawled on the lawn,which was an unintentional touch of humor. He says he is going to continue directing pictures and maybe next time he could hire a professional screenwriter.Speaking of directing, the Directors of the IMDb website should monitor entries more carefully.Currently, Gran Torino has an 8.5 ranking, which is a travesty.Since this puts it in with some mighty good movies,modern filmgoers obviously haven't a clue regarding what makes a good picture.Perhaps a separate category could be designated for films made after,say,1980.That might separate the film lovers from the dilettantes. 0.12000000000000001\n",

      "Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) \"at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us\".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr. Eastwood had a blackout, let's just hope his sense of quality returns and let's hope the majority of IMDb-ers grow a sense of quality so 'movies' like this don't end up in the top 100 of all time again. -0.048076923076923045\n",

The fact that us, the spectators, do not know what is going to happen in the next scene or at the end, how Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) will react, bearing in mind he is a bad-tempered and irritable man, makes us anxiously await to know the next move. I also enjoyed the process in which the children, Thao and Sue, entered Walt's life and changed his whole perspective and viewpoint on life (and death). The relationship and connection between them was unique and it was well adapted to the intriguing plot. I loved how flawless it was, from each character role, to the dazzling ending, which was so clever and precocious, left me speechless. However, the only thing I didn't like was Thao's acting.

      "This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be, rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful, awful, awful, and it goes on and on, and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually, all the barbershop scenes can go, because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said, the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name, and Clint keeps correcting him, asking to be called Mr. Kowalski, and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski, and Clint says, \"Call me Walt.\" Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example, the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over, move on. Okay, now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all, his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead, Clint goes on a suicide mission, somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says, \"This time there were witnesses.\" Well, hell, there were witnesses every time, but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together; the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing, and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of film-goers are morons. Oh well. -0.1662236987818383\n",
      "As great as Clint Eastwood was in all the films spanning his career, I have to believe that he's even greater as a director. In \"Gran Torino\", his Walt Kowalski could have been portrayed as one dimensional a character as the Stranger With No Name or Dirty Harry. Instead, Eastwood plays a conflicted retiree suffering the loss of his wife and the disintegration of his neighborhood while staving off the attempt of a parish priest to fulfill a promise to a dying woman. It would have been easy to convert Kowalski from a die-hard bigot to a reborn and reinvigorated Christian, but the film doesn't take that easy way out. This reluctant neighborhood hero never aspires to put aside his prejudice, but he does know the difference between right and wrong. I think that's why I admire the film so much. For justice to be truly color blind, one has to act on the impulse of what's right, not who's right. The first time I saw the film, I pretty much figured out what Kowalski was going to do. Knowing that he was dying, Walt sought out his personal peace with the Padre and insulated Thao from the chaos that was about to ensue. What I didn't count on was the measure of self sacrifice that would crystallize the character of this man who had killed in war, but had carried that haunting inside himself for a half century. Walt Kowalski would achieve justice on his terms without compromise, but with immense self sacrifice.

Walt is a racist old man who hates his Hmong neighbours, insults his Catholic priest, can't stand his sons and moans about having killed Koreans during the war.The first half of \"Gran Torino\" consists of cartoonish gangs harassing vulnerable little girls as they walk home from school. This provides ample opportunities for Walt to leap to the rescue on his surrogate horse, a battered pickup truck. Sillier still is when a young boy (Thao) is bullied by his cousin (Spider) and then harassed throughout the film for refusing to join their gang. Why would any gang want such a nerdy kid? Why would Spider abuse his own cousin? How could such a refusal possibly warrant a drive by shooting, and the other acts of violence portrayed in this film?From here on the film becomes a rehash of \"The Karate Kid\", Walt becoming the wise mentor who helps Thao toughen up and become a man. He takes the kid under his wings, teaching him how to speak American, talk to girls, spew racist slurs, do manly yard work and wield a hammer. But Clint's view of masculinity is intentionally satirical, as it's in Walt's bonding sessions with the women next door than he truly becomes a man.Unfortunately those pesky gang members continue to harass poor Thao. After a violent drive by shooting, Walt decides to call the cops, but apparently this is a breech of the Hmong Code of Silence. As the local Hmong take care of their own affairs and resent the assistance of the cops, it is left to Clint to clean up the streets.The film ends with Clint provoking the gangsters into committing cold-blooded murder. Clint's sacrifice thus magically shatters the Hmong Code of Silence, causing the local Asian community to report the gangsters to the police. Such a U-turn is implausible, even by Hollywood standards, and serves only to give Clint a redemptive, Christ-like ending.And so Walt Kowalski, racist, bad father, murderer of Korean soldiers, gives his life to save an Asian family, thereby earning his redemption. It's all rather clichéd, \"Gran Torino\" another in a long line of post 9/11 blame-taking movies. Films like \"Changing Lanes\", \"House of Sand and Fog\", \"The Visitor\", \"Babel\", \"Little Children\", \"Crossing Over\", \"The Interpreter\", \"Monster's Ball\", \"The Terminal\", \"Towelhead\" etc all hoped to counter American myopia, suggesting that Americans are not \"all alone\" or \"the centre of the world\". These films ooze guilt, are shameful of spoilt Generation Xers who squander inherited luxury and seek to align the white middle class with the marginalized Other.Far more interesting is the film's critique of masculinity. Michigan was once wealthy and held the flagship factory of Henry Ford, but today is the site of some of the worst poverty in the US. Walt's love for his Gran Torino and the fact that he was once an automotive worker, implies that the fate of Walt and the dying of the industry are intertwined. Though he belongs to a traditionally masculine age (which is slowly withering and dying around him), Walt is impotent when it comes to dealing with his family. He's basically tough on the outside but weak (literally bleeding) on the inside. In contrast, the Hmongs are immigrants who are vulnerable on the outside, whilst at home they have the strength and solidarity that comes from their family unity and traditional values.To articulate this point, watch how Eastwood treats the two houses in the film. Walt's is spotless on the outside but withered on the inside, whilst the Hmongs' house is a mess on the outside, but packed with an abundance of joy on the inside.Walt's over-the-top racism and masculinity is an anachronism that hasn't helped him leave his dying neighbourhood, understand his children, religion, properly articulate his emotions, or even tell his son that he's dying. It is in connecting with the Hmong and sacrificing himself, that he is able to evolve.So the movie walks an interesting line between self-parody and social consciousness, managing to also paint a neat little battle between classic union labour and global capital, a system that has eliminated the American working class, killed off labour unions, and outsourced all jobs to foreigners. But as one character explains to Walt, though the Hmong fought on the American side during the Vietnam War, they were promptly abandoned when the war ended. All ethnicities (Asian and American) are thus equal fodder for exploitation. The Hmong and Walt were used and exploited by American imperialist interests, a fact which Walt ultimately learns. His attitudes toward race and his practise of \"patriotism\" are therefore products of manipulation. It is in the system's interest to promote racism and intolerance because then the Walk Kowalskis of the world can go fight wars and happily justify it all away with a little racist indoctrination.7.9/10 – The film doesn't stray far enough from what Siegel did in \"The Shootist\". Both films feature an ageing tough guy who is urged by a strong woman to break his solitude and mentor a boy who is being drawn into a life of violence. Both films also feature a key scene in a barber shop where our hero \"cleans up\" and prepares himself for his sacrificial death, along with a sympathetic doctor, priest, tragic ending and countless other similar sequences.Worth two viewings. 0.021410736579275905\n",
      "It seems that Clint has embraced his old age rather gracefully. He's grumpier and creepier than ever. But still has that wonderful edgy flair that keeps us coming. His performance was wonderful and no one could have possibly played a racist Korean war vet quite like him. That aside the movie was terrible. Not because of writing flaws or cheesy one liners, like I expected, but because besides good old Clint, no one in this movie bothered to act. It was bazaar. Clint was spectacular, but everyone else looked like they were just reciting words on a page. I've seen better performances at middles school Shakespeare shows. The preacher had only one emotion, and it was so vague and useless that I couldn't actually understand anything he did. The bad guys were comical at best and the loyal friend, Toad, or what ever, was so unconvincingly angry that I just wanted Clint to let him out of the cage and get killed so I wouldn't have to watch him pretend he was enraged. Apparently, in his old age, Clint has forgotten how to direct actors. 0.07133333333333336\n",

      "Clint Eastwood has certainly turned out to the best \"double-threat\" actor/director in Hollywood. As he has so often, here he once again portrays a very conflicted man. To complicate things as the story begins we see him at the funeral for his wife. The movie wastes no time in our realization that Walt Kowalski has been an volatile island his entire adult life who likely was reined in by the balance his better half just barely was able to provide. Without her it seems he just may veer into the abyss as everything around him seems to be in some state of decay.Walt has stubbornly chosen to remain in a way past its prime area of Detroit now inhabited by more Asians than Americans. He has a problem with Asians quite naturally acquired in America's forgotten war, The Korean War. That horrendous war has scarred him and he just is not the kind of guy to reach out. It's his racism that ultimately leads him to finally extend himself to his neighbors as well as his priest. He realizes, you will sense, that even a man's man cannot find peace through violence. His solution is very unlike the other famous characters he has etched into our celluloid consciousness as he chooses a very different way to end the vicious circle of hate.First, and foremost, this movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption.Once again Clint Eastwood has brought to life a variation of the character he plays so well. This movie is full of humanity - much like Million Dollar Baby. Thanks Clint for this great movie. If you see it you will be richer for it. 0.1663938492063492\n",
      "I went to the cinema to watch this flick after i saw it was so highly rated on IMDb, mymovies.it and other movie sites. I have always been a fan of Clint as an actor as well as a director so i chose to watch Gran Torino while my other options were The Wrestler and Slumdog Millionaire. I left the theater very disappointed; the movie, as many others have said, is boring, predictable and the racism theme is trite. It isn't a terrible movie but some scenes are really dumb like the one in the barber shop where he tries to teach Tao how to be a man. Also, Clint making fun of foreign names...well, only a 8 year old could laugh at it. The movie is not an action movie, just a mix of comedy and drama. If you want to see a great movie about racism go get Crash. Vote 6 out of 10 just because i respect Clint Eastwood, but this definitely does not deserve to be in the top 250. -0.06325000000000001\n",

Pros: gripping story, and has good/funny dialogue at some parts. unfortunately it does have a disappointing ending which i wont spoil for you.

Clint produced a double magic act both performing an directing at 78 years of age now that i call somethin special. And also th end and the soundtrack astonishing; i really shared a tear when Thao and Daisy passes by in the Gran Torino and the song started; U can't dream of somethin greater this absolutely PERFECT.

      "This had to be one of Clint Eastwood's most timely made and produced movies . It is hard to say it is the best because he is a Genius and filled with a tenacious spirit at his talents which are so broad. The closing Song He did, The demise of a former Mega City with the auto industry shutting down. The one thing I respect the most is he used actors and actresses in new positions and they pulled it off. For all the flack Clint received about racial divides portrayed in the film it was all jealousy and poppycock. He offered these young actors and actresses an opportunity of a life time. What would a retired Vet think of when he comes home to ruins. He did an incredible job and I cried through a lot of it with his ability to pull on emotional strings like sacrificing his life for a young man that ran with the wrong crowd. I can't say enough to give him but an A+ 20 points. Incredible film depicting reality in a city that has gone to be a ghost town just like the mining towns of America.

And it was kinda like that, then I took it as a movie of a close minded boomer (like a caricature of a boomer) that obviousley has issues with other ethnesities, specially asians because of the Korean war, but as he come to knew this culture and persons he started understanding that not all asians are the same people from the war.It was entretaining, I don't think I'll rewatch it nor recomend it to everyone, just a select type of people (mostly boomers) 0.26173469387755105\n",
      "\"Gran Torino\" is the latest incarnation of Clint Eastwood's archetypal tough-as-nails yet soft-centred character. He plays Walt Kowalski, an elderly Korean War veteran who still harbours a grudge against Asian people. He doesn't give a damn what he says or who he says it to. He says what most people only dare to think and there's a refreshing freedom in the film because of it. He's just lost his wife and is facing up to life alone in a neighbourhood that has changed around him while he's remained the same.The catalyst for change comes in the form of his Hmong neighbours. A local gang of thugs forces Thao, the Asian boy who lives next door to Clint, to try and steal his prized Gran Torino car as an initiation rite into their gang. This propels Clint into action as his confrontations with various local gangs escalate into a bloody climax.It's his relationship with Thao that is the heart of the film. Clint sees the young boy as an opportunity to purge himself of some (but not all) of his hatred of Asians and to pass on some of his wisdom before he himself passes on. He becomes a father figure to the boy.The film manages to list seemingly every slang word for every ethnic group that there is (it avoids the N-word, choosing \"Spooks\" instead). It's a bit like that scene in \"Lenny\" with Dustin Hoffman where he looks out into the crowd at his stand-up comedy show and uses every derogatory nickname for every ethnic group in his audience: \"I see a Wop",
      "two Kikes",
      "Over there's a couple of lace-curtain Irish Micks",
      "\" It has themes similar to Clint's \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" and John Wayne's \"The Shootist\" (directed by Clint's old friend and mentor Don Siegel and John Wayne's last movie). It's like \"Josey Wales\" in that both movies deal with an angry, lonely man gradually allowing people back into his life after bottling up his emotions for a long time following a trauma (both characters also spit beef jerky constantly and have to deal with a cantankerous old woman who doesn't like them very much). It's also a kind of urban Western update of \"The Shootist\" in that Clint's character, although it's never specifically stated that he's dying of cancer but heavily implied, picks a fight with the evil local gang in the hope he'll catch a bullet and go out in a blaze of glory rather than succumb to the slow agony of cancer (just like John Wayne did). (You could also argue that Clint's character is a bit like Peter Finch in \"Network\" in that he's \"mad as hell\" and \"not going to take it anymore!\")Clint sings (or, better put, growls like Louis Armstrong) part of the song he composed with his son Kyle and Jamie Cullum over the end credits. We've been listening to Clint sing since \"Paint You Wagon\" and it's another reminder of his vast and varied career.(Strangely, when I left the cinema, I saw an Asian boy who was the spitting image of the kid in this film. Directly behind him was a Golden Labrador that looked exactly like the dog in this film!)The film is a tad overrated. It's a good film, but not a great one. Above average certainly, but not a classic. Perhaps the critics were raving about it out of respect to Eastwood the actor, the director, the icon and the man. (It's a testament to Clint that he's still pushing himself at his age, still curious and still making consistent, high-quality, challenging entertainment long after he could have given it all up to go fishing or play golf).If this really is Clint Eastwood's last film as actor and star as he claims, I will miss him. (I can remember renting \"Firefox\" on VHS for my 13th birthday and \"Sudden Impact\" for my 14th, so I've been a fan for as long as I can remember.) Just like that other Western legend, John Wayne, Clint has found an appropriate film to bow out with. But I guess if anyone has earned his retirement at 79 years of age, it's him. Thank you, Sir, for a lifetime of entertainment. What will we do without you? You are truly one of the all-time greats. Now ride off into the sunset, cowboy. Adios, amigo. 0.018384786117836963\n",
      "If there's a handbook out there on how to make an award worthy movie, Eastwood not only has it, but lives by it. For most people Gran Torino will be on their top list of the year, but Gran Torino is chalked full of content that screams \"award worthy\" that it has the opposite effect. And the mistakes in this film are too obvious to ignore. At least for me they are.Despite the praise this movie is getting, this is nowhere near the best of the year, or any best list altogether. This is a 2 hour instructional on how to make a movie with little to no budget that gets people talking about awards for it. So let me prove why that is.Cookie cutter characters, and Grand Torino is full of them. From Walt ( Eastwood ), to Thao, Thao's sister, the entire Hmong family next door, the gangsta cousin, and the Priest. When you start with generic characters you're going to have a generic story. But wait, if it's generic ( AND IT IS ) why are people talking awards? Why was the screenplay so honored? Simple, you add in the \"choker scene\".Despite being a generic story with generic characters there is one scene in the movie people will get choked up on. And I'm going to spoil that. Thao's sister gets raped. OMG HOW POWERFUL WAS THAT!! There I just listed what everyone talking about how they felt when they saw her. At this point in the movie the story already changed gears twice. Now this is the third change and its the gripper. Its the one that makes people say how powerful this movie is ( it isn't ) If anything it was a joke, when she came walking through the door I laughed cause I thought \" OH here's the award moment right here.\" But people eat this stuff up and Eastwood knows it. Cause they did.With the rape scene being the third story change I want to recap what happened before it. At first you see Walt hates his family, his neighborhood, the priest, and his neighbors. This goes on for a while. THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS!! Walt is liked by his neighbors, and in standard Hollywood fashion he learns more about the Hmong's which is basically a homage to any movie made where a foreigner is taught the customs and heritage of another race through an intelligent interpreter. That intelligent interpreter being Thao's sister ( SEE SO THE RAPE SCENE IS MORE POWERFUL LATER ) Add in something Walt does to SHOCK THE HMONG FAMILY, a mysterious Hmong shaman reads his fortune, Walt having a good time, and a conversation with Thao and end scene. Good to go to the next story change.From that point on the movie is Walt warming up to Thao and the rest of the Hmongs. Now these guys are good pals. But there's a lot missing in this I feel. Thao goes from Forrest Gump quiet to \"won't shut the hell up\" in the course of a montage of him doing yard work in the neighborhood. I liked quiet Thao. But no-so-quiet Thao was annoying. From this point on I had a hard time figuring out what the point of this movie was.And the lack of any really message left me thinking this movie served only one purpose. To win awards. And the screenplay did win one. And I think Clint won one as well. So as far as that end goes the movie was a success.But for me its more than just about the awards. I've watched a lot of critically acclaimed and award winning movies over the years and for the majority of them they suck. They suck cause they all follow the same sort of pattern. They go to the play book on how to put scenes together and what to do in them that make it predictable. And your award winning moment is always something that shocks people. So Thao's sister being raped is that scene, how it played out was predictable, and what happened after it was uneventful. And in the end your left with a movie that doesn't change anything that you perceive or thought before you saw it.There's no real emotion being had in this movie. Mostly cause the characters aren't likable. Thao's sister, annoying. Thao, interesting, then became annoying. Walt, funny, but too predictable to even care about. Walt could've have been likable but I had a problem when it was over. He liked the Hmongs who he befriended that summer more than his own family of 50 years. What a dork. I mean he couldn't even open up to them. But Thao was like the son he never had. But the catch is Thao wasn't any better a person than Walt's sons. Thao was better than his grand-kids, but the sons weren't worthy of so much hatred from the old man, at least not from what I saw.Overall this movie is a disaster. Sure you get wisecracking Eastwood, but you also get feed a lot mixed messages and movie cliché's that make your eyes roll. And to top it off you get Eastwood singing at the end while the credits roll. 0.21631886766334438\n",

After the predictable, boring, clichéd tripe that was Million Dollar Baby I risked seeing this as again I was taken in by all the good reviews... never again. Come on, when are people going to stop humouring this boring old fart? Drag his character over from MDB, make him a hate-filled racist as well as a scowling misogynist, and you have this guy.

Got even more tedious through the middle, most of the scenes being obvious set ups for all the 'emotional, hard-hitting' stuff later on, like MDB. The utterly inane and predictable build-up and ending fell jarringly flat, like MDB. By the end I was as angry as Eastwood himself. The film did reach a high point for me then, I had a LOL moment as Eastwood started singing (yes, singing) some puke-inducing crap song about his car through the closing credits, which I guess was supposed to be sad and emotional. The funniest comedies don't make me laugh that hard, the goriest horror films don't make me feel as sick. Thanks Clint. Now go back to bed and stop bothering people old man, don't get up again.

He loves to head fake his audience as he cleverly sidesteps stereotypical characters and concepts. You think you know Clint Eastwood, think again.This isn't Dirty Harry or Josey Wales, nor is it Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. This is come to expect the unexpected 21st century Clint Eastwood. Like a vintage wine, he keeps getting better with age. And like the Gran Torino in \"Gran Torino\" this is a modern day classic that glistens in the sun.Without giving away too much let me just say be prepared to laugh your ass off, repeatedly throughout most of the movie. And then be ready to stand up and applaud when he head fakes you again at the end. And then just smile and shake your head as he sings us through the credits.One of the better flicks of the year. 0.14901960784313725\n",
      "Here is a film sure to stymie many a viewer. \"Gran Torino\" contains more racist slurs than any film I have ever seen and they are spoken by the film's reluctant hero. And yet the movie isn't really about racism. It is, however, about a racist living in a neighborhood that has changed. Walt Kowalski who was once surrounded by Polish neighbors is now living among Laotian, Aftrican-American, and Hispanic neighbors. One gets the impression that Walt built an insular world with his wife who, when the film opens, has passed away. Now alone, he ventures out in to his neighborhood to find it radically changed.Racist language is wielded in films to either a)signal a character is evil or b)elicit uneasy laughter. It is also tends to define the character who uses it, making them one-dimensional. Walt will not be so easily pigeonholed. After defending his prized 1972 Gran Torino from thieves, Mr. Kowalski becomes embroiled in the lives and conflicts of his neighbors. At first his involvement with them is begrudging.The film is a little clunky with its uneasy mix of comedy and drama. Kowalski's boiling anger is frequently played broadly and the film's final dramatic confrontation too pat to satisfy. I was never bored by \"Gran Torino\" and it's an oddball of a film that shifts tones from broad comedy to violent melodrama to gentle observational humor. Clint Eastwood is as always a commanding screen presence and in Walt Kowalski, he plays one of the year's most interesting screen heroes. 0.031875\n",
      "I HATE cowboy films. I don't know why. Coincidentally the ONLY memory I have of one is \"The Legend of Josey Wales\", and the fact that he's always spitting on the poor dog.So I'm told someone got \"Gran Torino\" one night and I was thinking \"Pblt. Clint Eastwood. Western. Noooo thanks\". For whatever reason, I watched it anyway. I'll never forget - as the credits rolled, I was totally speechless. And not because I was shocked it WASN'T a Western. I could not believe what a fantastic movie I'd just seen. I mean just sat there! \"WHAT did I just see?!\" \"WHAT?? He WROTE that too?! How much talent is one person allowed!\" I was NOT expecting the premise, the storyline, the characters, the humor, (the bad-a** car), holding my breath, or tears for that matter. You fall in love with a grumpy, hateful old man without realizing it, and the fact that he hates everyone and everything strangely makes you love him more.Honestly, if you're easily offended; rather - you can't see a movie for what it's worth - I suggest watching Finding Nemo instead. The main character Walter is racist and hateful and brash, swears and is not exactly lovable to say the least, but it's part of what makes this movie - it wouldn't be what it is otherwise. Without realizing this, you'll be too distracted by the language to really appreciate what's really going on.It's why he goes through what he goes through - and even what gives him the human quality that makes you want to hug him (knowing he'd throw you off his porch if you did hug him) - which is just how you wind up loving his neighbors and the humor that they bring to the movie because of their \"love us because this is how we are, otherwise - well, love us. You have no choice. Eat some food.\"Walter is simply being who he is - which is a war veteran - and live out his life, he does what he sees as this the right thing, and never backs down - is what makes you cheer for him. He is, in my opinion, what every man needs to be - as far as knowing what the right thing is, and NEVER straying from doing it. He deals with life as it comes. Even when it would have been easy for most to say \"not my problem\".This movie just blew me away. So worth seeing!

      "I was seriously disappointed in this movie. The movie started off with some potential and seemed like it could get a bit interesting but after the movie progressed it just became very unbelievable. The acting for starters was HORRIBLE. Somehow this old man Clint becomes friend with his immigrant neighbour who's cousin is trying to recruit him into a gang. The relationship between clint and this family was completely unbelievable and interaction between the two was so unrealistic it just spoiled the movie. Clint also often threatens this gangs through several gestures all of which these gangsters blow off, their reaction to him is also very unrealistic.

      "Having just seen this latest peace of work by Mr. Eastwood I am stunned. The last time I can remember having so many mixed emotions from a film would probably be that of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Straight away we are rooting for Eastwoods character, Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old Korean war veteran who has just lost his wife. It is no surprise that Walt is a little bit tetchy, and one can only think they have seen this character some where before. It is clear that Eastwood is nearing the end of his journey so making a film of such depth and soul is a credit to the man. It deals with issues that young and old can relate to making you laugh and cry along the way. The simplicity of the film is its charm and handles sensitive issues such as race in a way that doesn't patronise. Oscar worthy? Yes, and one can only feel a little saddened as there isn't going to be many more these gems to come from one of the corner stones of modern cinema. 0.14356060606060608\n",
      "Clint Eastwood Rocks.By not letting his 78 years get the best out of him he still delivers a killer punch on the big screen.Gran Torino, is a poignant story about love, life, friendships and above all decisions/choices: how our decisions affect us and others, and how choices others make affect and perhaps even change us.What also is great about this film, is that though it keeps the audience engaged from the very start is does so as a comedy/satire whilst the drama builds up as the story unfolds all the way to its tragic climax.Keep them coming Clint 0.21875\n",
      "Some movie critics are lazy, resorting to a superficial comparison of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), Gran Torino's protagonist, to Archie Bunker, the iconic red-neck from the extremely popular \"All in the family\" series in the seventies. What this movie really talks about is the loneliness of a world-wearied old man who has just lost his wife. An odd-couple type of friendship developed with a taciturn, introvert Asian teenager brings new meaning to a life that is withering away. The story works just as well with the teenage being Caucasian. The ethic issue does add another dimension to the story, but is not essential to the spirit and soul of this movie.The movie starts with the funeral of Walt's wife during which the audience is shown in no uncertain terms the insensitivity of his family  a granddaughter anticipating going to college inquiring whether she could acquire some of his furniture when \"",
      "you, like, die\". Refusing to leave his lifelong neighbourhood that has now been taken over by minorities (with their respective juvenile gangs), the widower spends a good part of his days sitting at the porch sipping beer, admiring his vintage '72 Gran Torino, with as his only companion Daisy, the dog that has grown old with him. Phone calls and visits from his two sons are few and far between, and the only source of excitement is the perseverance of the parish priest who has promised his wife to bring him to the confession box. Then comes the unexpected friendship with the aforementioned young man Thao (Bee Vang).It is important to repeat here that Walt Kowalski is in no way an Archie Bunker. Nor is he an angry man filled with hatred as some critics would have you believe. Rather he is world-weary, bored, weighted down by remorse, disinterested in life, and with no passion for any real anger or hatred. Throwing insulting remarks, racial or otherwise, is just part of his habitual speech, as seen in his fond exchanges with long-time friend Italian barber Martin (John Carroll Lynch). Even his sentiments about his time in the Korean War is more apologetic than hostile.I will not elaborate plot details but just say that things start with the wrong foot with Thao. The breakdown of the barrier actually starts with Thao's older sister Sue (Ahney Her), who, despite the age gap, communicates with Walt in the same wave length, due much to her sunshine personality and cute flippancy. It is almost halfway through the movie before we start hearing Thao speak more than a few words but things pick up from there. Embracing him as protégé and friend, Walt lunches a project of making the shy lad into a real man - teaches him courtship technique, handyman workmanship, and even finds him a job at an Irish buddy's construction site. Destined to be counted among classic movie scenes is one where Walt takes Theo to the barber shop and, between himself and Barber Martin, tries to teach the young man how to talk like a man. This is the happiest moment in the movie.There are also heart-wrenching moments. There is ugliness and violence. Some compare the ending twist may bring to mind Aslan's fate in \"The lion, the witch and the wardrobe\", with one obvious difference. To frequent movie goers, the plot development is probably foreseeable from the very spit of blood Walt coughs. The most heartbreaking moment, although some may not notice or even agree, is the phone call Walt makes to his son with hospital test reports just received spread out in front of him. Walt tried to make small talks while the son, while civil, intimates that he is really busy. Walt does not get a chance to say what he wanted to, and probably wouldn't have said it anyway even if he had a chance to. This is one scene that will make a feeling audience's heart bleed.Clint Eastwood is the second best thing that has happened to the art of motion picture, ranking just below the invention of the movie camera. At 79, he is fully capable of giving the world many more wonderful movies for another 20 years. 0.0631523569023569\n",
      "The movie was good and the plot attracts you because of the feelings that the characters handle and the obstacles they have in their lives. The ending was unexpected and leaves you re-calculating but it also shows the relationship that walt achieved after the death of his wife. Another interesting thing is how they show Walt's perspective by not translating when his Hmong neighbors speak. But the movie is not that good since I think the characters are not the best acting and there are moments in the movie which you feel bored. 0.30625\n",
      "I was eager to watch this movie since I wanted to see it with my Asian friend who is from Vietnam, and I was not disappointing. We both equally enjoyed the unintended humor the movie creates just out of how relatable the situations were. The main protagonist, Clint Eastwood himself, does a memorable job, and his spitting like cowboy is still on point. Some of the supporting characters do not have memorable acting, but the plot carried the whole movie nicely. The lack of soundtrack in the movie did not impact my enjoyment out of the movie because I did not notice until later that there was no soundtrack at all since I was focused in the story. Overall, I think this movie was a good watch. 0.2858974358974359\n",
      "I know I'm severely in the minority here, but I just feel the need to say this because it completely shocks me that this film is even in the top 250 at all. I mean, I love Clint Eastwood, but this film disappoints me every time I see it. It's not bad--it's abysmal (and don't worry, I'm backing this up--read on).I'm not saying the film didn't have potential. The idea was solid, and the themes Eastwood was dealing with are excellent. This had the makings of a fantastic film. The thing is, so much about it is done so poorly that it simply doesn't match up.For starters, \"Gran Torino\" has some of the absolute worst acting I have ever seen--save for Dane Cook in \"Simon Sez.\" The performance of Bee Vang (Toad) stands out in particular--watching him over-emote, while retaining a certain amount of entertainment value simply for his amateur-istic facial expressions and dialog, brought to mind a middle- school talent show. The role of the priest, played by an uninspired Christopher Carley, is bland enough to fit into an actual sermon. In fact, not one acting performance stood out from the entire cast--even Eastwood's. He did a fine job of presenting himself as the racist war veteran, but there was a complete lack of emotion and human interest from his character.My biggest problem, however, was with the screenplay itself. The fact is that none of the characters are at all believable because they are written to be that way. Quite literally every character in the script seems to be based entirely on stereotypes (which, in a sense, is fitting, considering that--despite its romanticized ending--the entire film is essentially one long racist tirade. The gang members, for example, seem almost so pitifully inept that it is hard to feel intimidated by them. Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) family is so painfully over-demonetized that they are drained of any human component whatsoever. The list goes on and on.Furthermore, the dialog is absolutely painful from beginning to end. The humor of the film is entirely derived from racist comments directed from Eastwood's character. The script is repetitive (yes, we get it, you only eat cats. Ha, ha.) and messy--all of the lines seemed as if they were either trying too hard to be profound or simply seemed completely improvised. Worst of all, the audience can predict literally every twist and turn in the script miles ahead.I'll give it this--the next-to-last scene where Eastwood's character fights the gang is both one of the most bad-ass and well-done scenes I've seen, and it may well be worth seeing the movie for that alone. Still, I'd recommend avoiding sitting through the rest of it if you can. \"Gran Torino\" tries to be a plot-driven film with a message, but without the characters and dialog to back it up, it is difficult to suspend disbelief enough to absorb the message.In short, if you can forgive horrible acting, don't much care for snappy dialog or interesting cinematography, are very racist yourself, or just really, really like Clint Eastwood then this film might be for you. If not, skip it, because unless you are expecting a contrived and largely unbelievable mess, you are sure to be disappointed. -0.023457792207792198\n",
      "Gran Torino is a terribly overrated film that should not have done so well. You can tell Eastwood longs for his younger years. A 79-yr. old Dirty Harry is not a good idea, no matter how hard you try. Clint plays a bitter old man who hates everybody but his dog and himself. The movie was so intensely dull up until the end. And that ending.... wow clever Eastwood. Why didn't the old man just point the gun at himself and blow his own brains out? That's what the ending amounts to. What a disappointment. I was expecting Dirty Harry or Man with no Name or something other than this. And for a treat... Eastwood sings! Wow! Now I'm happy he died at the end. Maybe we won't have to hear him sing again. But Eastwood will probably wind up coming up with another disappointment to end his a career a third time. (He said he would after Million dollar Baby and this).You know why critics liked this? Eastwood's (supposed) finale. Period. End of story. In general, do not watch this expecting decent performances, entertainment, or even an climax that entertains. For Eastwood, watch \"Good,Bad,Ugly\" or \"Outlaw Josey Wales\". Those didn't have endings where Eastwood copped out.Overall, *1/2 out of **** (and that 1/2 a star because it made me want to watch his early films again) -0.06588541666666664\n",

The only other movies that come to mind that has the same effect are Finding Neverland and Gone Baby Gone.So many movies like this try to find a \"forced\" happy ending, thankfully, Eastwood resisted the temptation of higher box office in exchange for making a \"feel good movie.\" The film ended the only way it could have, and remain realistic.Sure, Eastwood shouldn't have given into the hubris of singing the end credits theme himself, but, that's a small issue, and in ways, his rough, raspy voice fits the theme of the film well.Only the fact that yes, the theme has been done countless times before makes this movie an 8 instead of a 9.See this one! 0.18088235294117647\n",

Most of all, standing up to a gang is something that all Detroiters and people in many parts of the country, and world, can cheer. I do hate the fact that so many characters with guts are depicted as alcoholics in film, let's get beyond that.

      "Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski who is a widower and Korean War veteran. Walt shows pride in his work ethic and continues to keep his house in immaculate condition even though the homes around him are falling apart. Walt shows his disgust in the lack of respect shown by the younger generation with grunts, snarls, and menacing looks that Clint Eastwood is famous for. Walt never talks to the Hmong immigrants that have moved into his neighborhood. He is racist and holds on to his stereotypes until his relationship with a Hmong neighbor shows him that he is wrong to generalize about people and he is portraying a stereotype of a racist old man.This movie shows that people need role models and a kick in the right direction to put their lives back on track. Walt gets his motivation from his neighbor Sue who shows him that she is a good person, fun to talk to, and has an attitude like his own. Walt is motivated to make sure that Thao does not end up in a gang and tries to teach Thao how to be a man and understand the value of hard work and making a contribution to the world.The film follows the development of Walt and Thao as they build a friendship. While Walt is not close to his own children, he realizes that Thao will ruin his life if he does not intervene and teach him honor, pride, and respect. Walt treats Thao like a son and Thao thinks of Walt as a father.When Walt learns that Thao is still being harassed, he attacks one of the gang members and warns the man to leave Thao alone.

      "Gran Torino (2008) is a movie about a widowed and somewhat misanthropic war veteran. This movie immediately gives us a clear picture of the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood). In essence, he is basically the grumpy old man archetype. He's callous, he's old-fashioned, he hates the new generation, and is traumatized by his past.However, despite its seemingly cliched narrative. The film does an impressive job exploring Walt's character in a compelling way. We learn that despite surviving the war and starting a family, he has never moved on. As such, he was unable to have a good relationship with his sons, and kept this up until their adulthood. Walt Kowalski also has a generally negative view of humanity, but he is no hypocrite, as he holds a low opinion of himself as well. However, it is clear to all of us that Walt, deep down, is a good person. And the film excellently portrays that through his interactions with others such as Thao (Bee Vang), Sue (Ahney Her), and Father Janovich (Christopher Carley).One of the film's greatest strengths is how they portray Walt's relationships. Among these relationships is with Sue, an asian girl in his neighbourhood. Walt saves her from a few thugs and they immediately form a rapport, with Sue being a generally charismatic girl and thus was able to break through Walt's walls. Another important relationship is with Thao, Sue's troubled and misguided young brother. Walt and Thao begin to form a father-son relationship despite a rocky first impression, we see that Walt does have the potential to become a good mentor, and he becomes to Thao what he wasn't to his own sons. Lastly, his next relationship is with Father Janovich. Just like Thao, Father Janovich and Walt also form a sort of mentor-mentee relationship. But this time, they appear to have different ideologies and often clashes wits with each other. Father Janovich holds a more optimistic outlook while Walt is of course, more cynical. Both characters attempt to convince each other of their ideologies and eventually gaining mutual respect in the end.Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt Kowalski is nothing short of spectacular, and may even contend for his best performance yet. However, there is much left to be desired for Bee Vang as Thao. In his defense, this was his first performance, but this does not excuse the fact that his acting makes crucial scenes somewhat unbearable to watch. But nevertheless, the film's excellent narrative and characters outshines its flaws. This film proves to us that Clint Eastwood is not only a brilliant actor, but also an impeccable director. 0.22447066822066825\n",

Simply elegant. Move the camera and design the blueprints to tell and tell a story. His actors are always great. Although you know perfectly how it will end, since it is intuited from the beginning, the script is great, goes step by step. He has a great photograph that he uses to tell you the story, not a mere color on the screen. As the movie progresses we see how he uses the symbols correctly and always to tell us a story. It will be a bit typical, but I love it when it falls in the form of a cross when dying, I am not a believer but just see it to understand what counts. It is based on a series of characters to tell us the reality of this world, as it has spread the world and everything surrounds it with an excellent staging with a good make-up and costume, it will look normal, but that is how it should be. 0.5809523809523809\n",
      "When I heard a movie was named after a call I thought, \"How good can it be?\" Of course I am talking about Grand Torino. Grand Torino is about an old man named Walt, Clint Eastwood, and he befriends his Asian neighbor named Thao after he tries to steal Walt's Grand Torino as an initiation to join his cousin's gang. He didn't want to steal the car but he has to work to pay off the debt and Walt teaches him how to be a man and Thao also teaches Walt how to coexist. Walt gets mixed up in gang warfare and has to make difficult decisions along the way. Clint Eastwood's racism and devotion towards his Asian neighbors makes this movie mix well. The story itself was greatly written but there were no surprises or unexpected turns. The story was very basic but it worked. If something happened terrible happened to a character, which it does, you feel sorry and mad even. People care about these characters and by the end you see how each and every single character developed and changed. Not all movies have that affect and this movie did it differently. Thao became a man, Walt learned to care and be a different man, and the priest learned life lessons.Clint Eastwood is certainly getting old and can't do much of what he used to do in Dirty Harry or his other classics. He plays an old man who just lost his wife, he is a Korean war veteran, which he struggles with, he barely knows or gets along with his two sons and their families. The war really damaged this man. He could not get attached to his kids or relate to them. He developed a racist attitude towards every race and color. At the party that man reads into his whole life and that scene basically sums up the struggles in his life. He also confesses to the priest but it isn't as strong. The only thing he ever loved was his 1972 Grand Torino. Eastwood was a perfect pick for the part but wouldn't win any award for his acting. At his age what can you expect? He did his best and he did pretty damn good.Stereotypes are used in everyday life but this movie crosses some lines, but necessary line crossing. This movie may be offensive but it offends everybody. Mainly Asians but it also touches on blacks, Mexicans, and even white people. Clint Eastwood makes a remark towards Asians intelligence. People who get offended towards movies and remarks made in movies are just stupid. It's a movie and that is how parts of the world really work. Sometimes in the movie, and for comic relief and there is nothing wrong with it.Problems with the movie are that it can get boring. For a long time nothing really happens and it's more talking and character development. Character development and relationships between characters is very important but it has to be done correctly. There were also loose ends. Walt's kids weren't really important. One tries to move Walt to a retirement home and he tries to get along with him it just doesn't work. The kids could have had potential for a bigger part in the story but it failed. Walt's illness or disease was a big deal but it didn't really matter. It could have been why he made his decision in the end, or so I think. Thao likes that girl but we never see what happens. A big part of the movie was him becoming a man and his own person and a working relationship and showing the success would really express that. Maybe it would be a little cliché but it's a risk that could have been taken.Culture, I haven't seen a movie that shows so much culture. The Hmong culture is so complex and this movie does a great job of showing it. Not touching the head, don't look in the eye, smile when yelled at, the food, the music, the rituals, all important examples that gave the movie a unique edge. It also touches on black culture and gang culture. Life in the gang is terrible but that is how it works. This movie was accurate and precise with the aspect of culture.Overall this movie was a little boring at times but the story was still fantastic. It was very close but Gran Torino does get the WillyT seal of approval. It's a movie that should probably be seen alone but can be seen with friends and have a good time. It's a good movie, I've seen better, I've seen worse, but still a movie I can easily watch and will watch again.

      "I am appalled at the positive reception this film has received on this site. This movie was easily the worst Clint Eastwood film I have ever seen, and it is competing for a top spot in the worst generally.Please note that the following criticisms might contain some small spoilers.The dialogue for the film breaks down fairly simply: Mr. Eastwood grunts, coughs up blood, utters a racial slur, or asks for beer, for at least, and this is not an exaggeration, 50% of his screen time.No, it is not a deep illustration of a man torn apart by war experience and racial hate; it is very, very, extraordinarily bad writing.None of the characters in Gran Torino even hint at having a 3rd dimension. The movie proceeds as though Mr. Eastwood wrote the script at 3 AM in the backseat of his car. It is impossible to recall one moment of this film that was not clichéd, preachy, or so comically simplistic as to leave the viewer struggling to appreciate Gran Torino on even an ironic level.One even gets the feeling that the producers, and even Mr. Eastwood himself, were aware that the movie amounts to little more than an expensive mistake. SPOILER At the very end, when the posthumous voice of the protagonist (for whose death I was beyond grateful) pipes in singing 'Gran Torino,' I entered a fit of laughing that held me and my companions for at least 10 minutes after the credits had finished.Watching this film is a lot like having your angry, old, war-veteran great uncle beat you over the head with a piece of raw meat. There is a slight chance you could find it sort of funny, but in all likelihood, the emotional scarring will be permanent. -0.1332288502743048\n",

Every year there is at least one Eastwood film distributed by Warner's and lucky for Warner Bros. and the industry in the moviegoing public that this great relationship continues with Eastwood approaching 90 years old.This film is so rewarding on so many levels depicting a man shut out by his family and confronted with the new realities of life.

      "The film begins with Walt, a Korea veteran who is mourning for his wife who has just passed away. The moment he returns home, he realizes that he has new neighbours, a hmong family which he hates due to his internalized racism towards asian people. Throughout the film, he will need to figure out a way to live with the people he judges. The film has a good use of foreshadowing and, although the soundtrack lacks a bit of quality and some emotional scenes are missing emotion, Gran Torino is an overall great film.I have found very little plotholes and almost all open ends are closed. The ending is just great. 0.13599837662337663\n",
      "In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino a grumpy Korean war vet has to adjust to a new life after his wife dies. Walt Kowlaski/ Clint Eastwood, is an almost white supremacist. He's racist against most other cultures, such as blacks and especially Asian \"swamp rats,\" and blunt and brash in his tone. Walt lives in what use to be a prosperous neighborhood which has turned into a project and a haven for gangs. Right next door to Walt live Sue(Anhey Hu) and her brother Thao (Bee Vang) who are the children of a H'Hmong family. The local gang sets it's eyes on Walt's car and send Thao to steal it for his initiation. After Thao gets caught he and Walt are forced to work together so Thao can work off his \"debt.\" This bring the 2 households closer together and Walt sees the H'Hmong culture, from the inside this time.Like Crash (2004,) Gran Torino is centered around a theme of Racism and how the characters overcome it. I had found the movie a great watch. Clint Eastwood showed emotion as he showed the struggle of Walt finding out he's closer to the H'Hmong family than his own. The movie portrayed Walt's family as greedy and disrespectful. The Son and his wife tried to force Walt into a retirement home and then were angry that he didn't want to be shipped off from his old home. The grandchildren showed blatant disrespect when they showed up to their grandmother's funeral. The girl and her older brother the worst. Walt clearly didn't approve. After the funeral, the grand-daughter asked straight out what Walt was going to do with his car and couch when he died. She also went on to explain that she wanted them for when she went to college in a couple years. Walt couldn't even bring himself to tell his son that he was dying, although the H'mongs seemed to spot the illness right away.The H'mongs were different. They showed Walt respect by bringing meals and gifts to his front porch at first, just because he sent a gang packing. Then they started to invite him over, make sure he was fed and alright. Su was the main instigator here after Walt saved her from being raped by a black gang. After Thao was done working for Walt he still would come over to help the old man. Walt became family to the H'mongs and felt more connected to them that he gave his life to bring the criminals that hurt Sue to justice. 0.070200776235259\n",

Another profound movie, where black-and-white attitudes obtain vivid nuances even in case of an old man (Eastwood was 78 when the movie was finalized). In spite of miserable and dangerous background, one has several bursts of laughter due to Eastwood character's appearance and his vocabulary and expression of stereotypes. One point less is given by me due to several clichés; pre-end of the movie, however, was different from my expectations.Moreover, it was educational to get to know culture and customs of the Hmong people - a relatively small group split into several countries in Asia and having difficult times even in the end of last century.Highly recommendable! -0.045416666666666675\n",

His transformation hinges on a single incident which I won't give away but it is certainly one which audiences can relate to. It seems a little easy and maybe it is but Clint gives such an excellent performance that he sells it. Ahyn Her is excellent as the young neighbor and fares the best of the mostly amateur cast but it's Clint's movie all the way. His Patton if you will.

The premise of this story was promising: a bigoted, crusty old Korean War vet with a chip on his shoulder forms an unlikely friendship with his Hmong neighbors. It COULD have been a great movie, and it started out well enough. But the acting was SO overdone, the script was SO cliché, and the characters were WAY too caricaturized, that the story soon lost all credibility. I was hoping that the film would portray a lesson about not giving up on people, even when they put up walls to keep people away. But Walt Kowalski was just plain mean. I found nothing likable about him. Part way through the movie, I thought, \"Maybe this is supposed to be a comedy?\" But if it is, I just don't think racial jokes and put-downs are funny.

      "I don't usually make reviews, but this is a movie that makes me do just that. I finally had the chance to see this on Blu-Ray, and I was completely touched.This is easily the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years; I'd put The Dark Knight above it and that's all. Eastwood truly gives an incredible performance, and I felt sympathetic with every point his character was making and the overall message of this movie.Obviously this movie turned off a lot of people due to the racial slurs and all that, but I look past all that and when you get down to it, he is not a racist, but rather someone who is simply not completely understanding the 21st century USA, and 21st century USA (the sons and grand kids) not understanding him. He's an old school tough good ole boy, and there aren't many of those left. He grew up in an era where Americans bought American-branded cars, kids respected elders, families actually got together for reasons other than wanting something (like money or possession gains) from you, teenagers didn't carry assault weapons with 5,000 rounds, gangs didn't control entire neighborhoods and cities, etc... just simple things like that which seem to be all but lost in today's world. I cannot say how much that aspect of the movie touched me. To me, Walt was not offensive; the way his family and the kids acted towards him, is the real offense here.To me, this film summarizes the modern USA. As a 32 year old Generation X member, even I can't relate hardly at all to people barley 5-15 years younger than me. Try to talk to them and you'll be told to wait until they're done updating their Facebook status or their latest twitter update on the goofball who messed up their order in the Wendy's drive thru, while driving their Honda/Toyota/BMW in the process.Walt's generation built Detroit into one of the country's proudest cities, and Walt is now watching his sons and grandsons commute in cars designed and built by foreign countries. Result? Detroit is now crumbling and filled with everything BUT the cars made by the Big 3, not to mention the gun-wielding gangs around every other block. As he said, would it really kill you to buy American? (and don't start the crap about some of them having factories here; if Toyota built a car in my back yard and I bought it, the money still goes back to Japan; if Ford built a car in Antarctica and I bought it, it still helps the USA more) A worker at a plant in Korea was once interviewed about having a job at a factory building some American car, can't remember the model, and he said he was happy to have the job, BUT he said he will still buy a Hyundai or Kia. When they asked why, he said, I feel it is important to support my home country's products. Go across the ocean to the USA, and we could care less about that way of thinking it seems.All in all, it's a car movie; a look at our modern world; a look at the generational gap between elders, sons, and their own sons.Some people didn't like the ending. I thought it made perfect sense. Walt knew he was dying after his coughing up blood and visits with the doctor. He then came up with a truly brilliant plan; make as much noise as possible, get the attention of many witnesses, get the kids to draw their guns and gun kill him, and the gang is off the streets.Does anyone think Walt's sons or that snotty granddaughter would have made such a sacrifice? And don't forget to stick it to your family who has made it clear they couldn't care less about you other than that to try to get your car or your house from you.That is Gran Torino in a nutshell.People really need to see this movie and take a look at how they are treating each other: family members, next door neighbors, and just total strangers. Maybe if we'd lift our head up from our Ipod screens for a few minutes and just go sit on the porch and get to know the people we see moving in next door, we might get to know them; and if we get to know them, regardless of age, color, background, or religion, we might begin to understand each other; and if we begin to understand each other, we'll be more sympathetic and caring; and if we begin to act more sympathetic and caring, this country will change.Great job by Clint Eastwood. 0.14174491392801253\n",

      "Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a gruff, unhappy, lonely, recent widower who is a Korean War veteran and a retired autoworker that lives in a run down neighborhood in Michigan where gangs are present. He doesn't get along with his children and he doesn't like his neighbors who are Asian. It is clear that he is prejudice when he calls them \"barbarians\". His gun was always near and he is often found on the porch with his dog Daisy, drinking beer and watching the neighborhood go by.Walt's neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), was pressured by his cousin's gang to steal Walt's prize possession, a 1972 Gran Torino, which he was unsuccessful. Instead, Walt developed a relationship with Thao and his family when he rescued them from that same gang who terrorizes the family. He became a protector and a father figure, as there was no male head of household.The theme of this movie shows that Walt was a racist but he was able to get beyond this once he befriended his neighbors and became a mentor to Thao. The other noticeable theme was Walt's Gran Torino. This car was his most important possession as it reminded him of the good old days when he worked in the auto industry. These were the days when you were respected, work ethics was instilled and you worked hard for your money. Today, Walt thought that the young generation didn't have those things. But, Walt was able to recognize that Thao was respectful and had the work ethics when Thao's family forced him to work for Walt for trying to steal his car.Gran Torino movie reminds you of his other films; such as Dirty Harry where he played the good guy/bad guy only he is much older. Clint Eastwood still portrays a character that is rough around the edges, his demeanor is still the same and he runs around with a gun. I should caution that some scenes in Gran Torino are also still violent and the language is strong.There were no fancy film techniques in this movie. There were uses of color during the movie such as the American Flag and the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer can, which reflects red, white and blue. The last scene was dark obviously leading up to the climax of the movie. There was some low lighting and general sounds from the outside can be heard when Walt confronts the gang that has been terrorizing his neighbors.Clint Eastwood also directed and produced this movie. Over the years, he has proved to be a successful in many of his films that he has directed and produced such as Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima and others. Gran Torino is one more movie that you should add to your list to watch. The lesson learned in Gran Torino is racism, work ethics, life and death. 0.06082175925925925\n",
      "I liked the movie so far, and though it's not a new movie, and released in 2008 more than 15 years ago, this was quite an interesting movie with unique and believable storyline. It's about a guy in retirement age who didn't get along with his disrespectful sons and his families meet his new neighbor after his wife passed away. At first main character Walt played by Clint Eastwood (the war veteran who fought in Korean war) was culture shocked by the different Vietnamese Chinese culture of his new neighbor he didn't know, but he started to show his softer human side of him as his style/believes matched the traditional culture of the Vietnamese Chinese culture of the neighbor, contrasted by his entitled American family he still has and despised (his sons and these entitled grand children he was not so impressed with).I quite enjoyed the storyline of the movie, it is unique yet believable. I could understand why this movie received some awards (even by international audience including Japanese film critics. One of the Production Designer was a Japanese American also, which I thought was interesting).It is sad though it is pretty much the reality even to this day that these immigrants from third world countries try to escape the dire poverty and didn't want to live in a third world country, yet when they come to America they are caught in the ghetto of the gangs and violence, even though some of these people try to lead honest life.This is when Walt (Clint Eastwood) plays big brother figure to this immigrant boy Thao. A teenage immigrant boy tried to steal his car at the very beginning encouraged by the as**ole \"cousin\" (yeah if you even want to call that as**ole cousin who ends up raping the innocent girl - though this was just assumed and the actual scene was not shown, thank goodness that would be just too far violent for my taste). But despite cultural and age difference Thao and Walt end up becoming great friends (brothers rather). I liked that the Thao's family highly thought of Walt and appreciated him, inviting him to the family gathering etc.And it is not only melodramatic either. There are several funny scenes too. I especially liked the Barber scene where Walt tried to teach Thao how to talk \"among the guys\", which I thought was very old fashion lol. But he was doing that so that Thao could get a construction job to earn money to go to college. I thought it was so nice of Walt who became like a big brother figure to Thao teaching many things, even the meaning of life and death.One big drawback was the last scene for me...that was just too sad that Walt decides to sacrifice himself by being shot to death by the gang (yeah Thao's cousin, what an as**ole), after telling Thao not to treat life for granted... Telling someone one thing and not following what he preached...that was not great. And it just was too sad of an ending for me (I cried...). But the Grand Trino music that played after was kind of soothing to the sad scene in contrast. It's a nice movie, tastefully done.Overall, this is a great movie to watch, much better than most of the recent movies coming out from streaming service productions that are less than impressive. It also has beautiful music too (though some may find cheesy and too old fashion/too old American feel). Recommend. 0.18757575757575756\n",
      "Look, I have absolutely no idea why this movie got such amazing reviews and why it has been the pleasure of viewers to make this THE HIGHEST GROSSING MOVIE OF CLINT EASTWOOD'S CAREER, but let me tell you right now that it was absolutely HORRIBLE. The acting is abysmal and even though Eastwood is usually great or at the very least watchable, his crucial acting choice concerning the tortured nature of his character was to speak for the entire movie through his teeth. I'm pretty sure he didn't unclench his teeth even once. Moreover, the script was just disgusting and the dialogue was stiff and stilted. Finally, the ultimate message of the movie seemed to be that this immigrant community was only able to save itself because the white man was willing to die for them.

      "It wouldn't be fair to say that Clint Eastwood was coasting through this movie. Nobody who directs and stars in a large-scale production while he's easing towards ninety is able to coast very far. Yet there is a relaxed and sometimes careless quality to this movie about a grouchy, lonely curmudgeon who slouches around mumbling to himself, smoking and drinking beer, cursing his neighbors, rebuking himself for something that happened more than fifty years ago, before his climactic expiation.One of those next-door neighbors is a Hmong kid named Thao. The Hmong are an internally marginal group who live in the mountains of Southeast Asia. A major effort was made by the US to enlist them on our side during the Vietnam War. A large family of Hmong live in that modest Midwestern house. Thao's initiation into his Asian gang involves stealing Clint's prized and exquisitely preserved Gran Torino. The plot is foiled and Clint gradually finds himself swept up into the dynamics of Hmong home life and Thao's integration into the gang.At this point in his life, Clint is pretty old and he claims this will be the last film he acts in. Well, the withdrawal is sensible enough. There aren't many roles for men who are so late in life. The ones that are available tend to form a genre of their own. The narrative structure seems to follow a line like that of \"Gran Torino.\" Grumbling old man is bitter and set in his ways, sometimes comically rigid. A new challenge enters his life and he rediscovers his humanity. Paul Newman went through it; Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau; Henry Fonda.As an example of the genus, this one isn't notable in any way. Except that Clint's profane, mumbling monologues are often pretty funny. And there's an amusing scene in which Clint and his barber try to teach Thao to speak the way real men speak -- nothing but curses and racist insults. As a director he keeps his performers hitting their marks.The performers themselves aren't always up to professional standards. His Italian barber, John Carroll Lynch, sounds like an actor. The boy and girl from the Hmong family don't quite clear that bar, although their monolingual elders come across as authentic enough.It's one of Clint Eastwood's lesser efforts but I give him credit for having done it at all.

His attitude is far better than so called hollywood young star now.My purpose has been served after watching this film . I understood, how carrying emotional baggage can make people suffer.

This story of a racist old war veteran and his Hmong neighbours is one many people in the world today could learn from. Eastwood's performance is truly brilliant with dark humour and memorable quotes throughout the film. This film deals with themes of prejudice and racism in unorthodox ways that is pleasant to see on screen.

      "Firstly,before I talk about the film I would like to make a mention on why is it that a film as Gran Torino failed to make a cut at the Oscars held that year...it simply amazes me on how a good film as this was even left out from the list of nominations!When you watch Gran Torino you realize that the film is all about love, forgiveness,friendship and sacrifice for a greater good. But when you scratch the surface and you begin to study the psyche of Walt Kowalski's (Clint Eastwood) character, a veteran war hero you find that Gran Torino is also about a man's triumph over his inner demons of being perceived as tough, incapable of loving,cold and unforgiving which may have been a direct impact on the horrors of war he had been a witness to and how along the way he becomes a saviour to a newly migrated family in the neighborhood and also ends up finding his spiritual moorings.I particularly liked the treatment in the film on the unusual friendship forged between Walt and the young Thao, their interactions, the bonhomie bonding between the two communities in the neighborhood, the one last time Walt goes to confession and the ending which was definitely worthy of mention.Now, if the climax had been \"bam bam\" it would have been straight from Eastwood's early films, 'ala the cowboy' ending and that's something I was anticipating after seeing Walt prepare for the final assault. It is also interesting to note that while today's film end on a violent note where the hero returns home glorified; Gran Torino is subtle, powerful and yet it has the same impact on you.Gran Torino in some shades also reminded me of Robert Pattinson starrer Remember Me which also dealt with a man's inner and external conflicts except that the latter dealt with sacrifice for the family's better good while Gran Torino transformed an indifferent,indignant underdog into becoming the hero of his neighborhood. But the underlying message in both the films demanded sacrifice whether it took the path of spirituality in Gran Torino or even if took a Gandhian philosophy in Remember Me to transcend the lives of the protagonists. In Gran Torino you find a good neighbor in Mr Kowalski!Clint Eastwood, an actor or a director? Though he was and is our much loved 'Dirty Harry' but over the years...he has definitely come to be our 'Million Dollar Baby'!!Definitely...a must watch!Sonyaa, www.sonyaa-random-musings.blogspot.com 0.1499298540965208\n",
      "What can you say about Clint that hasn't already been said. He's a terrific actor... no, make that, he's a terrific screen presence. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen, but you can't help but seeing an older version of every character he's ever played -- which is basically, well, just one: Clint Eastwood. So, given you know what you're gonna get -- you won't be disappointed with Gran Torino. At least when it comes to Clint. If he had cast experienced competent actors in the other lead roles -- specifically Thao and Sue -- Gran Torino would likely be a riveting, entertaining and award-winning film. But, alas, the amateur performances of the Hmong cast sink the film to, at times, high school production levels. I assume Mr. Eastwood chose authenticity over professionalism. Big mistake. It's like hiring authentic hillbillies (who can't play instruments) for a blue grass recording. The ambiance might be right, but the music will be severely wanting. 0.08818783068783069\n",

      "I had heard about this film from my father a while ago but I didn't get to watch it until our English teacher showed it in class. It took us two classes to watch it all but it never stop being entertaining and the feeling of wanting to know what comes next was persistent. It's a movie that starts with the death of the protagonist's wife and from there you have to unleash the layers of his backstory. It's hard to understand him since he talks with a racist vocabulary and keeps himself in a grumpy mood but nevertheless you learn to like him. Not to mention his blunt and quite laughable personality. The whole movie revolves on his growing relationship with the Hmongs, the family next door and the issues that come with them. This issues ultimately lead to the unexpected end. Unexpected but not disappointing in my opinion. If you were looking for some action then maybe this is not your movie at all because even though action happens it's not the point of the movie. There is a meaning behind it. A meaning on why he did what he did. Themes like family, racism, loyalty, friendship, love, crime, security, war and religion take an appearance. What does war do to a man? What's family? Who is family? Blood or the people in our lives who choose to support and love us?Anyways it's a movie that I chose to rate with 9 stars just because of the poor acting of some of the actors, such as Bee Vang who plays the lovely Thao. Ignoring that it's a movie that I would definitely watch again. 0.06230158730158729\n",
      "\"Gran Torino\" shows that Clint Eastwood is a real lion in winter,and although some of the performances by the mostly inexperienced cast are a little rough around the edges with Eastwood at the helm, the film still works.I'll admit I'm a huge Eastwood fan both as an actor and a director and have enjoyed his films since the seventies. This tale of a retired Korean war vet (and bigot) who has to deal with realities of recognizing his responsibilities both as a man and as a soldier has a redemptive quality that isn't seen much in cinema anymore. The film actually reminded me of Kurosawa's Ikiru in some spots. In fact I think a valid argument can be made that Eastwood, although considered more of an heir to the Ford/Hawks school of film making is actually more akin to Kurosawa than any other filmmaker and this film and his earlier World War 2 epics prove it. 0.14895833333333333\n",
      "I'll say this: Clint Eastwood tries very hard in this movie. Unfortunately, he labours under a poorly developed script with tissue paper thin characters.Right from the beginning of the movie - his wife's funeral, when Clint coughed I thought, oh no, surely not that old chestnut in a CE movie, oh please, he's going to die in a hail of bullets at the end of the movie so he won't have to die alone, sick with his lungs leaking.And sure enough.....It's not all bad, I didn't hate it like some reviewers here, but there are lots of buts.I just don't get what some reviewers say about his family. Here was this unbearable old codger criticising everything, even his granddaughter's clothes, and they are expected to love him? Come on! I felt utter sympathy for the sons every time they made an awkward call to the miserable old b. Even on his birthday when they tried to be kind, he throws them out.He is utterly unlikable and a misogynistic racist to boot, hurling epithets left right and centre and banning people from even walking on his lawn.This plot started perhaps with A Christmas Carol, and continues on through countless films. The slow thawing of the stony old heart - but unfortunately never turned towards the people who deserve it. His sad and sorry sons.Time out: I took a few minutes to speculate on what kind of woman would marry such an awful man. AND how she would tolerate his treating her children so poorly.Suffice to say is that Walt spots redemption through the Mhong family next door to him and promptly embraces it, along with the 12 year old family priest and then goes out Dirty Harry style in one of those signalled (from the first frame, cough) blazes.And oh that song from the dead man, written by him and son. How pathetic was that? Clint, you look awful good for your age and your career doesn't need this dreck. Get a good script next time. With emotional depth. Which was sadly lacking here.6 out of 10.

      "It is necessary to see the wrinkled, but first of all - the face of Walt Kowalski, distorted by unspeakable words of contempt, seeing off with a look of hatred those who came to the church to say goodbye to his beloved wife. Not excluding the young priest, Father Dzhanovich, who reads a funeral sermon in a pathetic tone, arguing that death brings with it both the bitterness of loss and the joy of eternal peace of the soul. One can only guess with what indignation and sadness Walt observes how there is less and less \"American\" in America - and now there are only Asians in the neighbors, and his son's family drives around in a Japanese jeep. And yet Clint Eastwood did not suddenly warn in an interview that the film, in which he may have played the main role for the last time, is directed against the notorious \"political correctness\", but at the same time is deeply anti-racist. No matter how Kowalski mocked the attempts of an inexperienced pastor to lure a convinced cynic and atheist to confession, but the old man's conscience does not know peace. It is not difficult to guess for what \"exploits\" he received a \"Silver Star\" that for several decades he has not been able to forgive himself those young \"blockheads\" whose lives he ruined in a foreign land. It is possible that the blame for the sharply deteriorated relations with relatives partly lies with him - at least to the extent that the parent is assigned. But, on the other hand, isn't Walt right, not wanting to put up with the general degradation, not believing his ears when his son suggests going to a nursing home, or genuinely wondering: \"What's wrong with the current youth?\"?In a word, bravo, Mr. Eastwood! \"Gran Torino\" deserves the high title of the cinematic testament of an outstanding actor, director, producer. Clint, as everyone remembers, almost immediately proved his right to be among the leading supermen of Hollywood - and brilliantly confirmed it time after time. But he seemed no less sincere, already in the early 1990s, one of the first (and few!) among his colleagues, calling for universal repentance and publicly repenting personally for the contribution he made to the glorification of the imperial ambitions of the United States. In his thirty-second production, Eastwood really reconciled himself to the changed reality, redeeming (symbolically - at the cost of his life!) dominating, like a curse, guilt and accepting a new America. And if the outcome of the picture \"In the Valley of Ele\" / 2008 / 2 was a bitter recognition of the hopelessness of the state of things at Home, now the cinematographer offers a way out, explaining under what conditions compatriots will have the right to hang the national flag again (by the way, flying at the entrance to Walt's house), as it should, and not upside down. If we take into account the huge commercial success of the picture,3 there is hope that they will listen to the clever advice. 0.08230990290312325\n",
      "GRAN TORINO is another masterpiece from Clint Eastwood and is a story that resonates with the diverse cultures of America today and the issues of assimilation into a white America. Eastwood portrays a typical blue collar American in the Midwest, hesitant to change, and dealing with his own personal issues. But when he takes on his neighbors and begins to understand their differences,along with their culture, magic happens on the screen and Eastwood's journey is one that brings laughter, as well as tears, to his growth and love for others. The Golden Globes missed out on this film, but Eastwood should be there at Oscar time and GRAN TORINO is a film that should be justly rewarded as the themes of life, death, family and assimilation of cultures into the American main stream, are extremely important ones. I can hardly wait until the Oscar nominations for GRAN TORINO. 0.15448717948717952\n",

One flips a coin and people die. Another reads his horoscope and . . . did I mention that I liked this movie? I don't know how Eastwood could ever top the sheer transformational power this film.

      "I recently saw this during its opening weekend in the Phoenix area. Clint Eastwood directs himself in this urban story of a retired automotive factory worker in Detroit who's wife has recently died and is left alone with his dog in a crumbling former blue collar neighborhood that has been inhabited by Hmong immigrants. An ambitious year for Eastwood as a director with this film coming at the heels of his critically acclaimed \"Changeling\" he goes in front of the camera to deliver yet another classic Eastwood character. At age 78 he plays a crusty bigot who is at odds with his grown sons and their families and the modern world in general. Filled with great lines from a story by Dave Johannson and screenplay by Nick Schenk it's got to be the wittiest drama ever. I hope it's not Eastwood's swangsong as an actor and we see more of him on screen. A great film. a classic and I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. 0.20833333333333334\n",

      "I had no intention of watching this, but my friend called me up and asked me if I wanted to watch it. I must say that I do not know why people love Eastwood's movies so much. I felt as if it was just not put together well. Maybe that is not the best way of putting it, but I would definitely say that he has no originality and does not bring anything new to the table as a director. To me it seems as cookie cutter as one can get with movies of this type. I felt as if the acting was terrible, but there were moments when I thought Eastwood was good, but not enough for me to think that he did a good job with the movie. I do not think that the script was all that strong to begin with and the dialog was a weak as it could get. I know the movie is about breaking views about stereo-types and prejudice and crap like that, but it did not resonate at all. I found myself laughing at a lot of racial slurs and I do not know if that was intentional, but it took away from the seriousness of the movie for me. Being a minority growing up with a lot of racists in my life might have skewed my view on this, but I do not think this was a realistic progression for any of the characters. This movie is as formulaic as it gets from the script to the music choices to the acting. Nothing unique about this movie to make me want to rate it any higher. 0.127020202020202\n",
      "Clint Eastwood's acting and career can be summed up in the fact that he was a tremendous presence both in front of and behind the camera. Walt Kowalski is a role tailor made for this American icon. It's a role we've come to love Clint for playing and yet it has more depth than we come to expect.Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War vet living in a neighborhood that doesn't belong to his ethnic background anymore. Kowalski is a racist, not because he truly has anything wrong with other races but because he hates himself. His beloved wife Dorothy has passed on, leaving him to contemplate his mortality on his porch with Daisy his Labrador Retriever. His neighbors are a part of the Hmoung population. He comes to befriend Thao and Sue his next door neighbors who are trying to grow up on the wrong side of the tracks. Despite his best efforts he becomes a father figure to them willing to sacrifice everything for the people he has come the closest to in his lonely life.Putting it bluntly, the audience wants Harry Callihan. Kowalski is Callihan incarnate and yet he is a deeper and more satisfying character. I for one admire Eastwood for retiring the Callihan character and yet giving the audience what they want. Kowalski is a geriatric racist but he is as much fun and has as much spunk as Callihan did in 1971. What Eastwood is doing is quite brilliant, he is both paying homage to the Callihan breed of character and yet giving it a dissection as well. Behind the gun and the grimace lies a deep pain. Eastwood isn't a superhero and isn't trying to be one at his age. The idea of the superhero and the action hero isn't appealing when you are dealing with a 78 year old man. Kowalski is a tragic character who realizes that his life is a complete void. His gruff exterior hides a deep inner pain. It should be noted that Kowalski does not fire a weapon once in the entire film and yet the publicity posters and trailers make this out to be an action film. I wonder if Kowalski would be pushed to firing a weapon. This makes the ending of the film all the more satisfying. The ending is truly one of the most brilliant scenes Eastwood has ever filmed.Eastwood is playing a vulnerable man and we don't expect this from him. Eastwood himself is larger than life and to see him take on the role of Walt Kowalski and deliver despite it being a very similar character is really special. 0.16065323565323567\n",

      "If the rumors are true and Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting role, then Eastwood  the director has staged and performed his grand exit gloriously. Gran Torino has been called not the perfect movie and blamed on handling some very controversial subjects rather heavily. I may agree with these statements but perfect or not, Gran Torino is a fantastic poignant movie with the storytelling at its best, the characters we got to know, to understand, and to care about, their interaction that seem real, and the ending that moved me to no end. I won't say better about my admiration with Eastwood than Roger Ebert did: \"What other figure in the history of the cinema has been an actor for 53 years, a director for 37, won two Oscars for direction, two more for best picture, plus the Thalberg Award, and at 78 can direct himself in his own film and look meaner than hell? None, that's how many.\" How many actors can play a character who is in the beginning truly unlikable, hating, angry old racist but during the course of two hours he would turn to you with such different facets that it would break your heart, move you deeply, make you want to have old Walt as your friend, and make you think that Walt's late wife, the only love of his life was a lucky lady? Eastwood pulled it admirably, and I can't think of any other Artist who could.Many viewers and reviewers talk about Eastwood's returning to his most known and admired cult role of Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan', and it is true, but the film is about many many things - about sad loneliness of aging, for once. It is about how hostility, mistrust and contempt for people of different from you language, way of life, traditions, culture, and background can be slowly but gradually replaced by interest, mutual respect, and understanding. It is also about the loss or not even ever having connection with your own family and not finding the way to re-connect. The film shows that it is never too late to change something in yourself, to become better - no matter how long you have to live. The last theme brought to my mind the film made 57 years ago by great Akira Kurosawa, \"Ikiru\" - \"To Live\". Very different, both films have in common the theme of inevitability of the end of a life and what can be done if the end is close?And what about Gran Torino? It is the rare collector's car of 1972 which sits in Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) garage. Walt, who had worked 50 years at the Ford's factory in Detroit, Michigan, participated in its assembly and bought it in the same year. Gran Torino was the reason he got to know and involved in the lives of his next door neighbors even though he never planned or expected for that to happen. 0.20417095483133213\n",
      "I saw this movie on opening day and the theater was packed and loud, but when the movie opened",
      "silence. When the 1 hour and 56 minute film ended, the silence was gone and there was some applause. My point, \"Gran Torino\" is a captivating film. It's not the typical shoot 'em up bang 'em up like a lot of Eastwood films, nor is it about emotional intensity (even though there is some of both in the movie).This movie is about a single, aging man, looking out at the world from a cynical viewpoint. He's estranged to his family and can't stand his neighbors who happen to be all Oriental. Yet when a young boy tries to steal his Gran Torino, he develops a unique relationship with him. I know this sound like the previews, but there's much more to it that I won't give away.But I will mention that Clint, who I think can relate a lot to the character he portrays, gives probably his best performance since \"Unforgiven.\" I am shocked and disappointed that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. I was also impressed with the other cast members, particularly with Ahney Her as Sue. She stands as a comic relief in the film as well as someone you would want to befriend. As with Bee Vang as Tao, he's decent, but there are times in the film where he seems to be just reading his lines rather than putting oomph in his character.I also enjoyed the song that Clint wrote and performed at the end of the film \"Gran Torino\" which was nominated for a Golden Globe, but is robbed of an Oscar nomination. The other uses in the film such as editing, directing, and music all added substance to the film. And surprisingly for a picture by Clint Eastwood it has a lot of humor (most which is racial), and also some sad parts to it. If it's true that this is the last film Clint will star in, then he made an excellent farewell with a bang.My rating: ***1/2 out of **** 0.16449096880131364\n",

      "The first half of Gran Torino grated in a bad way. How many more contrived scenes with racial slurs and name calling can story-tellers come up with - it began to remind of Crash unfortunately. Luckily the movie pulls out of it midway to develop an interesting story-line with grumpy-old-racist Wally and his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood is pretty much Oscar-the-Grouch for the whole movie, and the humor is dryly funny at first, but it wears pretty thin after repetition. I didn't think too highly of support acting from the brother Tao and especially the sister Sue , but they deserve a bit of slack being first-timers I suppose. Also, why do lead characters need to die to bring more meaning to things? Awfully clichéd - Wally doesn't need to die. Eastwood is good as Wally - though dry, sarcastic, angry.

It's difficult to imagine anyone else playing his part and especially the comic aspect of it with the same dead on results. Having been an admirer of Mr Eastwood for most of my life I think his secret as a director might be that he has the attitude of a craftsman rather than an \"artist\". From what I've read about his on set tactics he seems to be relaxed and patient enough to wait for good things to happen and tasteful and experienced enough to recognize them when they do. This is definitely one of the movies he will be remembered for, both as an actor and a director. A couple of major awards would definitely be in order! 0.14379166666666668\n",
      "Another high quality film from Clint Eastwood. When you look at his track record he is definitely one of the great living Hollywood directors. He has a great eye for a story that will grab people's attention.Gran Torino is about a lot of things, aging, family relationships, the immigrant experience amongst others. The story is quite simple. Walt (Eastwood),a widower living alone in an area of suburban Detroit now mostly inhabited by Asian immigrants. He dislikes them intensely and doesn't try to hide it word or deed. Due to an incident he (almost despite himself)becomes close to the young Asian boy living next door. He tries to pass on his beliefs on what is right and how a man should behave to the boy and they become friends. However local tensions arise again with tragic consequences and Walt has to make a decision about what is the right thing to do, knowing it will effect him, the boy and the boy's family.Eastwood is excellent, literally growling through some scenes as Walt expresses his (mostly negative)opinions about the world around him. In more than one scene he plays to good effect with the \"Man with NoName\" and \"Dirty Harry\" characters the audience associate with Eastwood. The middle part of the film, as Walt and his neighbour become best buddies is very funny at times, though we know somehow that violence will rear it's ugly head before the end. A moral tale then and one well worth watching. 0.17866995073891628\n",
      "Walt Kowalski's next door neighbor tries to steal his prize Gran Torino as an initiation for a gang. Walt Catches him and as pay back ends up taking the kid under his wing and teaching him things. However the gangs are still around and won't leave them alone.Clint Eastwood's second film in 2008 is a good little film about a life, getting older and how the people we \"hate\" may not be as bad as we thought. I like it, though to be honest I don't quite understand the exceptional raves the film is getting. Well acted I'm not certain that Eastwood really is the right choice for the role of Kowalski, though I'm guessing that with out his starring role the film may not have been made. This is not to say its a bad film, its not, not even remotely, its just that the Oscar talk surrounding it seems to be out of place and due more to the director and star.The scenes between Walt and his young neighbor are quite good and they more than make up for the scenes between Walt and the young priest which seem to be there to bludgeon deeper meaning into the proceedings. As it its a deceptively simple film, the film becomes something much more complex in its ending which raises some interesting questions about what might have happened earlier (I can not explain that with out revealing the end of the film). I don't think the film needed the priest scenes to be as 'clear\" since I think the film was complex enough as it is.

Gee, how about them growls. Wasn't that just the most clever thing? We could have seen the dog movie and had more depth. Even the big ending was comically bad and again, just plain silly.

This was so well done in every aspect that I may do something I never do and see the movie a second time. The writing was absolutely fantastic, the acting was beyond fantastic, and for once there wasn't any politically correct baloney. There was certainly a great deal of bigotry, cursing, and crass behavior but for some reason it all came together and actually enhanced the story. I'm not sure Clint Eastwood is given proper credit for his directing and producing; this movie exceeded another of his efforts, Million Dollar Baby, by a mile. If you're offended by normal day-to-day coarse language and being politically incorrect, don't see this movie; however, if you enjoy a true to life conversation, by all means, see Grand Torino!! 0.17830882352941177\n",
      "Gran Torino (2008): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley, John Carroll Lynch: Provocative Clint Eastwood thriller that uses the Gran Torino car owned by the hero as a symbol of connection. Eastwood stars as a war veteran recently widowed and disturbed when an Asian family moves in next door. When a gang threatens their lives he becomes involved and viewed as a hero. Wonderful portrait of self sacrifice directed by and starring Eastwood. Eastwood is known for portraying characters of great nobility and here he makes it his ultimate standoff. He has isolated himself from family since his wife's passing but the Church she attended makes unappreciated visits. Strong supporting work by Bee Vang who is in with the wrong crowd but discipline places him within the realm of great character and reward. Ahney Her is attacked by the gang but will find refuge in Eastwood. Christopher Carley plays his deceased wife's pastor whom Eastwood doesn't care for until he needs questions answered. On the minor negative end, the antagonist gang are more or less types over personalities. These scenes are provocative and portray one's curiosity with regards to faith. Very powerful and one of Eastwood's greatest films. It presents themes of forgiveness and self sacrifice where good triumphs over evil and the innocent is rewarded the ultimate set of wheels.

      "Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old Korean War hero who recently lost his loving wife. He's a hard cold man of a different generation. He's angry at young grandkids, his new Mon neighbors, and nosy Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). The next door neighbor boy is shy Thao who gets wrangled into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his older gangster cousin.There are lots of easy stereotypes. Clint is playing the hard man. It might as well be the man with no name in the hood. Clint is acting with a bunch of nobodies. That's the biggest problem in this movie. The other actors are not up to snuff.

      "I really liked the film Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood does an outstanding job in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski. Kowaslski is a Korean War vet and retired auto worker who has maintained the gritty nature from both environments. Eastwood who also directed the film does a good job of pulling in emotional effect by maintaining Kowalski's grit and hardcore exterior while changing the hardness of his heart. Kowalski takes interest in his Asian neighbor Thao and his family. Kowalski serves as the male figure that Thao has needed in his life. In doing this, Kowalski struggles with the social problems encountered by Thao and his sister, especially from an Asian gang.Kowalski kind of reminded me of my father who was also a war vet and worked over 40 years in the steel industry; he possessed a hard exterior, but deep down inside he had a soft spot for people. The way that Kowalski embraced not only the cultural difference, but age difference as well showed that he had a coming of age so to speak. This film showed how Kowalski lost his wife, but gained the love and respect of Thao and his family. His strength and character were also shown in a very good way.The production was good as well. The use of different forms of lighting as well as the camera focus added to the quality of the film. Gran Torino is a quality film that I would watch again. 0.20457671957671958\n",
      "I have never gone out of my way to watch a Clint Eastwood film. I had heard that he was brilliant, but it wasn't until i saw Gran Torino that i fully understood. He blew me away, and so did the movie. I had no prior knowledge about the storyline beforehand; as far as i knew, it was based on car racing, like the video game Gran Turismo. I complied with the movie choice and went along. What i liked about this movie so much was that it was funny and centered around the theme of humanity. It focuses on Walt (Clint Eastwood), a disgruntled old Veteran, who has just lost his wife and is adjusting to the upsurge of multi-ethnic residents in his local community. As the movie unfolds, he becomes increasingly aware and learns about the cultural dynamics in his community. There are difficult/unpleasant moments of gang violence and cultural ignorance, but the relationships Walt forms with his next door neighbors (who are Hmong, an ethnic group in Southeast Asia) are really enjoyable and touching. How they confront the problems in their community is essentially what it's all about and it is a very emotional journey. 0.17777777777777778\n",

      "Clint Eastwood has a style of filmmaking that is almost unique to him and him alone. While he is a conservative straight-shooter with no time for political correctness, he also possesses a nuanced understanding of the human condition/emotions that makes him a masterful storyteller and director. Both of those characteristics are readily apparent in \"Gran Torino\", making for a movie-watching experience unlike any other.For a very basic overview, \"Gran Torino\" tells the story of Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), an aged \"Greatest Generation\" individual (Korean War vet) bemoaning a recently-deceased wife, a family ready to ship him to a nursing home, a priest (Christopher Carley) who won't leave him alone, and a new set of Hmong neighbors that make him uneasy. One night, a Hmong gang nearly succeeds in stealing Thao (Bee Vang) away from his family until Walt intervenes (rifle in hand) and unknowingly saves the young man. Hailed as a (very reluctant) hero, Walt begins to get to know his new neighbors-thanks in large part to the more outgoing Sue (Ahney Her)-and forms a bond with Thao. Without much hope of Thao escaping the gang in the long run, however, Walt must take matters in his own hands to give the young man a chance at a successful future.Because \"director Eastwood\" is so straightforward in his building of characters and themes, it's easy to look at \"Gran Torino\" and see nothing more than a collection of crude or outdated stereotypes. Walt snarls at-and often openly insults--his ethnic neighbors, only smiles during racist jokes told at the local watering hole, and brutally badgers a local priest who simply wants to check up on him. In other words, there's a lot here that isn't \"kosher\" in the sense of how we believe the hero of a film should behave. This makes it very simple to write off the whole endeavor has hopelessly outdated or even offensive. But do this at your own peril, as if you can see even slightly past Eastwood's bluntness, you'll find a film brimming with real human emotion that captures the essence of an entire generation.You see, \"Gran Torino\" is basically an ode to the aging (then in 2008) generation that fought in WWII & Korea. More specifically, in the case of Walt Kowalski, men who served their country but could never quite escape the horrors of war or the changing society around them. For as irascible as Walt can be, he still retains a grasp on the human spirit-it simply looks a little different than \"back in his day\". These are the moments that make this a 10/10 star film. Things like Kowalski taking Thao under his wing, calling his son after a health scare, seeing Sue roughed up by the gangster thugs, and explaining to Thao \"what it's like to kill a man\". There are few motion pictures that capture so perfectly the essence of a group of people like Eastwood does here.I've seen \"Gran Torino\" 3 or 4 times now, and every viewing I sit down and think \"is this maybe an 8 or 9-star film instead of a perfect 10?\". But as Eastwood's warbling-but-soothing vocals play over the end credits, the 10 stars always hold. Even through Eastwood's opinionated methods, there is simply too much raw (and real) emotion here for it to be anything below the highest possible ranking. 0.13811857334584604\n",

Nick Schenk tries way too hard to make this movie bad-ass that every single line from a character contains some derogatory name-calling. honestly, people don't call each other names as often as this. and to have Eastwood's character sacrifice his life at the end all because the Hmong family didn't want to tell the police that Thao's sister got raped is just plain dumb. what made it worse was that supposedly, Hmong keep things very private but yet witnesses who saw the murder blabbed to the police faster than the speed of light. and you would think those gangsters who shot him would run away or try to hide his body but instead they stay there at the scene of the crime, pretty much waiting to be arrested by the police. let's get real here people.all in all, lack of character development from 99% of the characters and crappy screen writing made this film clearly Eastwood's worst and most forgettable movie, period. -0.08740981240981238\n",

The sold out crowd left the theater, some silent, some crying, and others like myself feeling like I had just truly experienced something... something wonderful, something painful, something so undeniably true and loved that it will remain a part of the viewer indefinitely. 0.2371111111111111\n",
      "Walt (Clint Eastwood) is a rough around the edges, highly racist old man mourning the recent loss of his wife. His inner-city Detroit neighborhood has begun to get much rougher, however, his stubbornness and stand-offish nature prevents him from even entertaining a move, despite the insistence of his spoiled and selfish sons. Although he is very racist by nature, Walt has a good heart hidden beneath his demeaning slurs (I will warn you that there are many throughout the film).When the only neighborhood that he has known becomes terrorized by a local gang, Walt begins to take action to prevent the gang from destroying the lives of those around him. Despite his crude nature, he befriends a next door Korean family and begins to relate with them more than his own family. Through these interactions, he slowly begins to soften up and see that some things are really worth fighting for. In the end, he is willing to put his life on the line to ensure that that family (as well as others) are able to live free of gang oppression, and have the opportunity to maximize their own version of the American Dream.The soundtrack for this film was beautiful and peaceful, brilliantly matching the tone of the film. If you are looking for a movie with lots of action and little to no dialogue, refer to any nonsensical Marvel movie that you can find. If you are looking for a movie with purpose, direction, and some well-timed action (and inaction), then you will love Gran Torino. I almost never give a 10/10 review, but this movie fits the billing. 0.18506461675579322\n",
      "I am not a film reviewer, but a movie lover, and as much as I just wanted to see some good old Clint Eastwood ass kicking, this was a wonderful film, documenting a part of our collective American existence, one which I am fortunate enough not to be a part of but have some familiarity with.I feel like Mr. Eastwood has told a story many older Americans living in older communities would like to carry out, to toss out the trash so to speak. It dismays me to see the laziness and crassness of the modern youth, regardless of ethnic background, the lack of work ethic and the denigration of the value of all persons, no matter their age, race or creed.It is easy to be lazy and it is hard to work to better oneself. It is easy to isolate oneself and takes bravery to break the barrier into another person's world. I took this from this film. I feel honored to have taken it in and am pleased that an icon such as Mr. Eastwood would continue to enrich the entertainment world with his presence.Thank you sir for doing so. 0.26435185185185184\n",
      "I think some people get so used to high budgeted films with special effects and big-named actors that when they see something like Gran Torino, they think it's garbage. Well, I completely disagree. I've seen this movie a few times now and each time, the story moves me and the comedic dialogue makes me laugh. Sure the actors are not the best you'll see in a movie, especially the kid, Thao, which somehow made me cringe a few times. This adds to the dialogue which could have been better, because yes, it was funny a few times, but I believe they could have changed something. Overall the movie was okay, the plot of the movie is what got me the most, and i enjoyed watching it a lot. 0.25419642857142855\n",
      "This film really lived up to the high ratings and positive reviews. I really didn't know what to expect and I must say I was not at all disappointed. The character development in this movie and the interactions between the main characters were great and also heart warming. Clint Eastwood is still a tremendous actor even in his golden years. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to end. It was paced well and had a nice mix of humour, drama, action, emotion, cultural exploration, cultural understanding, redemption, forgiveness, finding manhood, modern issues, relationship building and human interaction. The ending was highly satisfactory unlike a lot of other great films which often seem like they didn't know how to end and conclude what had transpired. This film for me had the perfect ending! HIGHLY RECOMMEND watching this movie. 0.2491558441558442\n",
      "Eastwood's movies have to have a \"message\", that is nothing new. Over the years, however, it seems that the message has become increasingly predictable, more boring, and its delivery hasn't improved either.The story itself is very ordinary: old man with several regrets and a few serious chips on his shoulder makes up with life, which in this case comes to him in the form of Asian neighbors. Confrontation gives way to friendship, which sets the stage for tragedy and a poetic resolution. Tons of clichés and no surprises are the hallmark of this film. At the very end it apparently intends to surprise the audience, but anybody who has paid the slightest bit of attention to the character arc of the protagonist can see that there is only one resolution left.To be sure, there are good moments. Eastwoods character is hilariously politically incorrect, casually filling his speech with racial epithets, and getting a number of funny lines out of it (obviously, folks who are easily offended will find it difficult to summon the required humor). Then there is a hilarious scene that Eastwood has with his barber, expertly played by the otherwise underused Lynch. It turns out to be the highlight of this movie.Much of the movie is sanctimonious and preachy; it obviously wants to tell us something about ethnic prejudice, and even inserts some expose about the Hmong people, for no apparent reason, as whatever would follow from it does not matter to the narrative. The transformation of Eastwoods character from bitter old man who despises everything foreign (including the foreign cars sold by his son) to cheerful participant at Hmong barbecues and confidant of and matchmaker for Hmong teenagers is ludicrous, and neither the script nor Eastwoods acting can make this believable. That is too bad, as it is the anchor for the rest of the story.Sanctimony is personified in the character of the preacher, whose offers of \"spiritual\" support are originally rejected by Eastwoods character, but then gradually accepted, for no apparent reason other than that this guy just won't take no for an answer and even stalks the old man to his social gatherings. The protagonist, who otherwise has no problem defending his privacy (and his lawn) by pointing a loaded rifle at an offender, reacts to this outrageous behavior by inviting the \"padre\" to a drink and shooting the breeze about life and death, revealing that neither of them had much to say about either of those two things, and resulting in one of the lamest simulations of \"philosophical depth\" on screen in recent memory.But slushy messaging, sanctimony, and superficial dialog aren't even the worst offenders in this stinker. That distinction goes to the two key supporting acts, Vang and Her. Neither of them has the slightest clue about acting, remaining uninvolved throughout as in a middle school play rehearsal. That is bad for Eastwood, since their characters are supposedly what is melting the stony heart of his character, but it is really difficult to see how these two dull teenagers could possibly accomplish this. One of the reasons for Eastwood's lack of believability is the emptiness of their performances, particularly that of Her.And so the story moves to its predictable finish. We even get to see a \"resolution scene\" showing how the old man deals with his greedy granddaughter in his testament, which feels like the closing scene in a 70s/80s TV series, when everybody gets together to share a good laugh about the final resolution.At the time of this writing, the movie's 8.5 rating has propelled it into Top 100 territory, so obviously people like it. To me, it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen by a long shot, although it certainly is among the worst Eastwood films. -0.04177966641201934\n",
      "The old grumpy vein of Clint Eastwood produces this film. Where this time the elements of drama are superior (more numerous, more dramatic) than the elements of comedy (present, but only sparingly and to characterize key characters). And therefore much darker. This darkness can even make you think of a political film: communitarianism, racism of course, insecurities, very difficult family relationships. Not to mention the role of the church... The few scenes with the children are also well written, rough, without being subtle.Clint Eastwood interprets an unsympathetic character, a war veteran, an associai, but who has certain qualities, which will lead him to suicide, for a joyful redemption.A dense and rich scenario: Clint Eastwood will call again on Nick Schenk for The Mule (2018) and for Cry Macho (2021). 0.07093837535014004\n",
      "Clint Eastwood has surprised me with his directing since I first saw 'Mystic River' (2003) and 'Changeling' (2008). His latest directing efforts left me sat watching the very last credits roll. 'Gran Torino' is a simple, funny and shocking drama surrounding a widowed Korean war veteran who discovers a connection with his neighbours, a Hmong family.I saw this movie twice and both times it delivered what a movie should, a consistent journey of emotion without overloading. The pace offers much room for prediction but I didn't anticipate the ending and how it would leave me thrown back into my seat not wanting to be the first to move as the lights fade up in the theatre.I thought it was great to see a director having physical input into the soundtrack to the film, Clint Eastwood & Jamie Cullum's track at the end is beautiful. I've been humming this since I I first saw the movie and I can't wait to buy it. Possibly one of the years best! 0.19\n",
      "Why has this movie and its director/star been ignored by the Oscar committee? Clint Eastwood plays Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Walt is recently widowed, but obviously has been crusty and rough around the edges and bigoted and prejudiced for most of his life. Still living in the old neighborhood he is uncomfortable with the Hmong family that have become his new neighbors. He will soon reluctantly befriend the young girl Sue Lor(Ahney Her)and her brother Thao Vang(Bee Vang), who actually tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. When crusty Walt defends the brother and sister from a rivalry gang of the Hmong family, he becomes treated as the neighborhood's guardian angel.My favorite scenes are any and all with Sue Lor answering Walt's non-PC and bigoted comments matching him barb for barb. GRAN TORINO in spite of being pretty predictable, it is a heart-felt human drama finding comedy in indifference.Also in the cast: Brian Howe, Brian Haley, Brooke Chia Thao, Chee Thao and Scott Eastwood, you know who's son. 0.09909090909090909\n",
      "In the 1970s Ford made a car model called the Gran Torino. The main character in this movie is Walt who, after serving in the Korean War in the 1950s worked for Ford in Detroit. In 1972 he was on the assembly line, and actually installed the steering column of the Gran Torino which resides in his detached garage and workshop in the rear of his modest home, still pristine and Walt's pride and joy.Clint Eastwood directed and stars as Walt Kowalski, and as the movie opens we are in the local Catholic church at the funeral for his long-time wife and partner. He sneers at the behavior of some of the younger in attendance, and in fact Walt sneers a lot. He sneers at the \"rice burner\" car one of his sons drives. He sneers at the Asian families in his neighborhood. He seems to just want to be left alone.The parish priest is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, who informs Walt that on her deathbed he promised Walt's wife that he would look after him. Particularly she asked that he go to confession. Walt sneered at the priest and told him he didn't want to have any part of that, he only went to church to keep his wife happy.So that sets up Walt's character, by all indications he has no close ties with anyone now that his wife died, not even his two sons and the grandkids. He sits on his porch, drinks lots of beer, and his usual meal is beef jerky.But somehow he takes pity on the shy Asian teenager next door, and in Walt's own way berates him into being more outgoing and to assert himself. Bee Vang, in his first movie role, is Thao. When Thao is forced by his older and larger \"cousin\" to accompany his gang, they tell him he must steal the Gran Torino to show he is worthy. But Walt catches him, and almost shoots him. The family requires that Thao make amends so he is given to Walt for a week or two to work for him. Walt puts him to good use cleaning up the neighborhood, fixing things in disrepair, and in the process teaches Thao some skills, which leads to a job. Walt sees value is trying to save this kid from the Asian gang.Thao's slightly older sister is Ahney Her as Sue, also in her first movie. She is the opposite of her brother, assertive, but this gets her into trouble with the gang members who want her to submit.The story is the transition of Walt from a grizzled, indifferent war veteran to one that has a purpose in life. He sees that these two nice, intelligent teenagers will not have a chance to develop their lives with the gang influence around, so he must help figure something out.SPOILERS: Walt even in his old age is strong and wily, and knows his way with guns and battle. But he has another struggle, lung cancer. He occasionally coughs and spits up blood but doesn't tell others the whole story. Faced with a hospitalization to try to cure him, he instead decides to protect the youngsters. The gang has to be caught in the act, with witnesses, to get them off the streets and into prison. So he shows up at their house one night and, reaching for his lighter, they all shoot, killing Walt. He was unarmed. He gave his life to save these kids, partly in reparation for his having killed any number of young Koreans in the 1950s. In his will, he gave the Gran Torino to Thao, with the provision that he wouldn't paint it or alter it to look like the abominations that many of the younger crowd were doing to their cars. 0.11752136752136752\n",
      "I don't write reviews but I just had to say something about this film.Im a huge Clint fan and have been for years but this had some major flaws and I am having trouble looking past them. I am mainly referring to the acting. I have heard that Clint shoots really fast and this movie shows it a lot more than others. The obvious answer is the largely amateur cast he chose for this movie. Did he do it for budget reasons? I assume so but it kind of ruined many parts of the movie for me. That kid is just not actor material. The mother as well. Of course he did a great job but that's not enough. It's as if he was being lazy and wanted to just knock this out as fast as possible.I also think the singing in the end was just a little bit off for some reason. Worthwhile?

I am a huge Eastwood fan, especially his spaghetti Westerns ('What'd you say your name was, stranger? Clint: 'I didn't....') to his Dirty Harry movies, which we have all the lines memorized by heart, right?I was disappointed instead. Clint does not play a very convincing bigot, and that's no surprise, since Clint has never really acted, he's just played himself, and the man personally is very liberal and not at all a bigot.His 'I'm getting SOOOOO angry!' faces are hilarious, he looks like an aging Bruce Banner turning into the incredible Hulk or something, reminded me of a crocodile.The 'evil' Asian gang also does not come across convincingly AT ALL. They are like 12 year old's with Uzis. I would expect far darker characters and acting. The fighting scenes are like playful wrestles. In the end, Clint is playing himself, or his version of an aging Dirty Harry near the end of his life.His death scene sacrifice is hollow, as we all know how often people escape the courts these days, there's no justice in it. Better to have had us hate one or two of the gang members especially bad (maybe the ones who raped Clint's neighbor) and have him actually kill them.Really, to have the legendary Dirty Harry and High Plains Drifter fade out without getting to kill a single person in the movie was VERY DISAPPOINTING. Sorry if I am so jaded and evil and nasty and low brow, but THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT, not some biopic of Clint's career fading to black....And the end sequence with Clint 'trying' to sing? OMFG....

Someone thought that 90% of the people commenting on this film wouldn't know good acting or a good script if they saw it.

      "Gran Torino is not Clint Eastwood's best movie. Not by a long shot. However, even when Eastwood is not quite on top of his game, the result is still pretty darn good. I didn't even mind the somewhat depressing ending, because...well, that's just Eastwood. No one tells a tragic tale better than him. And what occurs in this film is tragic. But there is a ray of hope found at the end of this story...the idea that sacrifice and honor will ultimately defeat suppression and hatred. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a crotchety old man, and an angry bigot. At times, it's even a little difficult to like the man. But, as the famous saying goes, \"you can't judge a book by it's cover.\" And, in the end, when the time calls for Walt to make a decision that will ultimately bring about dire consequences for himself, but ensure the safety of others, he doesn't even think twice. This is vintage Eastwood. That's not to say that there weren't any problems with this film though. Actually there were quite a few. It did seem a bit long, and yet the running time was just a shade under two hours. Simply put, there were a few scenes that could have used some editing, or could have been cut out completely. An example would be when Walt takes young Thao to the barber shop. I know that this scene was supposed to help illustrate the friendship developing between Walt and Thao. However, I think the film had already established that fact by the time this scene rolled around, and thus it seemed a bit redundant and distracting. And I'm not surprised that this was the first acting experience for Ahney Her (Sue), and Bee Vang (Thao). While they did a passable job, it seemed like, at times, they were reading their lines from a cue card. Part of the wooden acting, however, may also have been the result of a screenplay that needed some work. But, even with all the weaknesses, this is still a pretty good film. I would even go so far as to say it's a must for Eastwood fans. And if, as some have suggested, this is his last film as far as acting is concerned, he goes out with a bang.

Was it nearly as deep as it tries to pass off as? Hell, no.Before everyone goes off on this movie being all deep and meaningful, let me remind you it has all been done before, and it has been done better. Better movie exploring racism and the banding together of races in poor neighborhoods? How about Spike Lee's \"Do The Right Thing\"? Better movie about old men teaching a boy about how to become a man? Does \"Secondhand Lions\" ring a bell?My main problem with the film is this--no one is surprised by the turn of events. No one is surprised by the grumpy old racist man. From the very beginning of the film it is one long string of predictable events. Oh, there's a racist old man who fought in Korea. Hey look! There's a family of Asians living right next door! Hmmm, the kids cousin is in a really funny looking Asian-wanna-be-tough gang. I bet that will be trouble. Oh, the boy has to go work for the old man? They will probably become best buds and when the old man drops dead, as they always do in movies, he will leave him the car. Let's see...thirty minutes in, and I know the whole movie. The true irony is that in the movie Tao asks Walt if he should watch paint dry, which for a large part is what this movie was like (did that stop me from crying? Of course not.)

      "\"Gran Torino\" is an awesome move. I don't understand the people who don't like it. It works great as a comedy and a drama. Clint Eastwood is a very comical character. He always has been funny (going back to \"Every which way but loose\", \"Pink Cadillac\") and that side of him comes out fantastically in the movie.Clint plays a very cool older man, Walt Kowalski. He recently lost his wife and is estranged from his family, who want to put him in an old age home. A young Hmong teen and his family (who are neighbors) befriend him and they form a unique bond that seemed very unlikely before. I won't reveal more, or it may spoil the enjoyment of this great flick.Watching \"Gran Torino\" is a strange moving experience since it is a mixture of so many elements, it falls outside many genres. It's both drama, comedy, thriller, action and love story.

He fully delivers in his latest film, Gran Torino.Walt Kowalski(Clint) is Korean War veteran, who lives in Detroit.He is a bitter old veteran. When we first meet him,he is at the funeral of his wife.

He has very little connection with them.One of the few white faces still living in his neighbourhood, Walt gets involved with Thao, who is being threatened by a local gang. Thao is from Hmong,the people relocated to America from Laos .For Walt, who is a racist and makes no attempt to hide it, the sight of these immigrants are too much for him. He uses words like \"gooks\" and \"fishheads\".One of Walt's prized possessions is his Ford Gran Torino. He never drives it, but he keeps it in mint condition. The gang urge Thao to steal the car as part of his initiation into the gang.Walt attempts to save Thao from the gang and adopting him as his surrogate son.He may be a racist, but Walt reclaims his humanity.Why is the film called Gran Torino?The car is a symbol of old fashioned values,values that Walt sees disappearing.

To a small extent that's true, but not the undercurrent. The girl who played Sue has a big future, what confidence on screen. Everyone has a father, uncle, granddad just like Eastwood in this role. And we all have our own prejudices against migrants - until we get to know them. Don't want to give too much more away - this is a must see.

      "My daughter told me that Clint Eastwood reminded her of my dad and my late father would have been so proud of that. My dad was always grumpy and always used expressions like Clint does in this movie. \"For Fu**s sake\", \"you got sh** in your ears?\", and calling me an idiot and toughening me up for the real world was my dad through and through. I think the writer of this movie met my dad and this movie is based on him.Every person who played a roll in this movie was real to me--even Clint, who my dad LOVED as Dirty Harry. Grumpy and Tough as nails, \"Walt\" has no close family relationships left after his wife dies. His kids and grandchildren are spoiled and only want things, not a real relationship.Walts neighbor, \"Toad\", tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino in a gang initiation and Walt doesn't fu** around -he grabs his rifle and cocks it in military fashion and nearly blows \"Toads\" head off but slips and falls and Toad get's away.The next day Walt accidentally saves Toad from the same gang members that encouraged him to steal the Gran Torino. Toads family and friends start pouring food and flowers and herbs and stuff on him in thanksgiving. Then Walt accidentally saves Toads sister, which just causes more thanksgiving towards the grumpy Walt.The breakthrough between this racist white guy and, let's face it, an equally racist grumpy grandmother of Toad and the entire family is beautiful and wonderful. Every person in this movie WAS their character in the movie to me. It was real and raw and full of real life.Clint, you called your own son a \"pu***\" in this movie (his son plays Trey).

But he himself gave it away in one of the scenes by reading his horoscope predictions. So let me say that maybe I already knew the climax.But this movie was so enjoyable just because of Clint Eastwood and some good supporting cast. His energy level simply surprises me!

      "I was a little thrown by this movie (mislead you might say). By all the previews I saw on television, I thought this was another \"Dirty Harry\" action/adventure film. Clint does possess some of those qualities in his \"Walt\" character but to me, the movie was about him developing qualities of acceptance...of his neighbors, of his stint in Vietnam. It was so beautifully told, very moving. To watch his \"gruff\" character grow was amazing. I won't spoil the ending, but I would have preferred something different than what happened. I will also have to admit, I could have done without Clint's singing during the credits, but I was impressed he wrote (or co-wrote?) the song! I would highly recommend this movie even if you aren't a big Eastwood fan (like I am!). I truly hope Clint gets recognition for this movie (an Oscar or Golden Globe maybe). It (in my opinion) was one of his best! 0.3020454545454545\n",
      "While focusing on Walt's bigotry it seems some of the viewers missed several of the broader and more interesting themes in the movie.It is given, in the beginning of the movie, that Walt is a bitter man. He lost his wife, has no connection with his children, his old familiar neighbor is a wreckin essence, the world as he knew it is gone. Not only is the neighborhood falling apart, he is too, as are his peers who peek out from their own windows to witness the degradation.It is also given that he is haunted by his Korean war experience. As one reviewer observed, he has a seemingly justifiable reaction to the Asians as his neighbors. That he fails to realize that his bigotry is misplaced, unfounded, and wrong is his flaw. One of many.Balancing his bigotry is the bigotry of Thao's grandmother, who sits on her porch, cursing her fate, and Waltevery bit as blindly and as vehemently as Walt himself does.It does not take Walt very long to see that Thao and Sue are worth knowing. While Sue makes the effort, by inviting him to her family's barbecue, Walt is quick to accept the invitation.And, it does not take long before Walt's racial slurs, awful as they may be, become terms of affection, however inappropriate. Just as he calls his barber, and his construction supervisor friend by equally appalling names, so he speaks to Thao and Sue. Walt is incapable of gentler words, it isn't in him. It is, in effect, the only way for him to express affection. But his actions prove him to be a good man. As he takes Thao under his care, teaching him the skills he sorely lacks, Walt reveals his better nature.In the process they help each other. They each gain. Thao and Sue get the protection of a father figure, Walt gets a family. The slurs are a reflex. His real bigotry and hatred is reserved not for ethnicity, but idiocy. He truly rails against the white boy who escorts Sue into the wrong neighborhoodfor his idiocy. He truly despises the gang-bangers because, in essence, they are idiots, and dangerous at that. That they are Asian is irrelevant. Had they been white skin-heads his reaction would have the same or worse.The anger Walt carries is unbalanced. Thao and Sue give him balance.The film has a fatal flaw. While it is true that Walt protects Thao and Sue, and becomes a better man in the process, his pent-up rage causes him to react in the wrong way, which leads to something truly unsettling. He warns off the gang with violence, by beating and threatening one of the gang members. That was a mistake on his part. The revenge which the gang extracts, which could have been predicted, leads directly to Sue's rape.Whatever themes the movie presents, none are as powerful, and lost in the telling, as Sue's rape. Thao's ultimate coming-of-age wisdom gained through Walt's guidance, is nothing compared to the pain which Sue endures, and it is glib of the film's writers to offer such a tidy ending. Walt's ritualistic cleansing and self-sacrifice, replete with body-on-the-cross death, fails utterly to speak to Sue's pain. While Walt will ascend to a heavenly reward (for his sins, as confessed to Father Carley, were trivial), Sue will carry the horror of her experience for the rest of her life. The writers do not see this, and it is a blatant failing, and it nullifies the feel-good ending.In Million Dollar Baby, which is more or less the same movie, Eastwood's character must do the unthinkable, commit a mortal sin by offering Hillary Swank's character release. In doing so he is condemned. In Gran Torino there is no such recognition of Sue being condemned to her memories. In an otherwise moving film, it is unacceptable.What Gran Torino does offer is a story of redemption. That a man of Walt's flawed nature can embrace the very thing which he abhors makes the film of some value. His embracing of Thao and Sue is touching, and the process is funny and sad.Something which goes by very quickly in the movie is the misunderstanding Walt has for the Hmong's place in history. He sees them as he sees the Koreans he battled: as the enemy. In fact, as Sue points out while riding with Walt in his truck, the Hmong were allies of the United States and the South Vietnamese against the North Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war. The Hmong, as a people, sacrificed a great deal, including their homeland; for after the war, and the Communist/Nationalistic victory, the Hmong were cruelly treated, that is to say either killed or displaced, for their association with the Americans and the South Vietnamese. That the film's writers acknowledge this is important.Another theme the film suggests is race on race bigotry. That the Hmong gang preys on their own is, in Walt's mind, beyond the pale. For those viewers who see only Walt's bigotry, they should also see the bigotry which lies within all cultures.Gran Torino is a small film, and it is flawed. Still, on many levels it is a touching and meaningful movie, and worth seeing. It is a gift for most viewers to get a glimpse two marginal worlds: Walt's crumbing America, and the Hmong culture as it is integrated into the American fabric.Ultimately I am haunted by Sue's rape. -0.006071428571428559\n",

      "I thought this movie was superb. If this is Clint riding out into the sunset then what a way to go. His legacy is one that will never be matched. From Rawhide to Gran Torino, we have watched this actor/director transform a character into someone real and genuine. Clint is in a class all his own, with no peer anywhere near him both in focus and originality.Walt Kowalski(Eastwood)is an individual distraught by his wife's death and the changing world around him. The remaining members of his family are viewed by Kowalski as blood-sucking vultures and rightly so. His neighbors, Asian in heritage, surround him and his dog. He has watched as his neighborhood has racially and culturally changed and has deep resentment toward his neighbors. His racial epithets continue, even though his next-door neighbors consider him a hero, after standing up to the neighborhood punks who rule the mid-western city neighborhood he lives in. His tough love and fatherly approach toward his young Asian neighbor is heartwarming, even after the boy tries to steal his Grand Torino initially. The boy needs Walt and Walt needs him to try and understand their place in an ever-changing world. Kowalski is a man who is lost in the 1950's. A Korean war veteran who has killed and has seen killing. His hate for Asians, presumably due to the war, is subdued after acts of kindness by his neighbors and the boy he befriends. Kowalski's parish priest is persistent in attempting to subdue the hate that boils within Kowalski. In the end the priest gets through to Kowalski, learning something from Walt as well. Kowalski repents in the end and offers up the supreme sacrifice for his Asian neighbors. A heart-warming story that leads one on an emotional roller-coaster. 0.03353174603174603\n",

A lot of the humour derives from the outright curmudgeonliness and unashamed racism of Walt Kowalski, but far from all of it.And Kowalski isn't simply a two dimensional redneck throwback. He's a real person - unlikeable certainly, unapologetic about his prejudices definitely, and still carrying the mental scars of his part in the Korean War 50 years earlier. But he has a strong sense of right and wrong (in broad strokes), an affinity for those who relate to him in the same strong (manly, if you will) terms with which he journeys through life and, above all, a preparedness to transcend his prejudices and judge individuals on their merits.The humour which runs through the early part of the movie sits very easily with the strong drama which takes the story through to its conclusion - the two are complementary, not contradictory.I think this is one of Eastwood's very best movies and I enjoyed it a great deal. 0.14115591397849464\n",
      "Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece picture, both as an actor and as a director. It almost feels like Eastwood is an older version of Christopher Nolan, at the fact that every film made is astounding. Westerns aren't made much these days. This is a largely known fact. So a gangland film is the closest he could get to the Wild West. And the guns are blazing, the characters are spitting venom and the community is completely in a motion of terror. The title of the film is the name of Kowalski's (Eastwood) 1972 car, which his neighbours try to steal. Now, the film takes a bit of an ironic direction, something Eastwood is easily able to do. His Hmong next-doors are from the same origin as the Koreans he killed in the war, and they try to steal his car and end up being taken away by Hispanics and Kowalski saves the people who tried to steal from him.

      "I'd like to think of myself as a movie aficionado - alas, I began my Clint Eastwood experience later in my life and I have now seen about 10 of his movies. Out of all of the movies so far, this must be at the top of the list, if not for his directing skills, but his outstanding acting.At 78 years old, Eastwood delivers possibly his finest acting performance of his storied, legendary career - not only in his delivery, but in his all-out involvement and dedication to portraying the gritty, war hardened bigot, Walt Kowalski. I have seen other posters claim that this character has been played before by Eastwood, and this may be true; however, none of his characters have ever gone as in depth and complex as Kowalski. Hard and crusty on the outside with a warm and difficult center, Eastwood explores the inner conflict of a hardened Korean war veteran who has a severe disconnect with his own family, and one who is very alone and seems content being so. Living in a gang-infested area of suburban Detroit, Walt seems to be all alone; however, he takes an interest in an Asian family that lives next store - only after the young boy Thao is caught by him trying to steal his vintage 1972 Gran Torino SuperSport. Thao is then forced to work for Walt as payment for his actions, and during this time, Walt grows close to the young boy and becomes sort of a role model to him. This relationship spreads to the rest of his family, especially his sister whom he also becomes very close with. The result of these relationships is something very special ultimately brings out the best in Eastwood.Without saying any more about the movie, I was thoroughly impressed by Eastwood's incredible performance - one for the ages. 0.1630952380952381\n",

      "Clint Eastwood! The name itself just sounds ... well ... bad ass is the only word I find appropriate and when one thinks of this wonderfully talented man they think of the many bad ass characters he has played, they think of Dirty Harry Callahan, they think of The Man With No Name, they think of William Munny and now they'll think of Walt Kowalski who in my mind is one of his finest performances to date and hopefully will become one of his most memorable characters in the future.Eastwood directs, produces and of course stars in his latest film appropriately titled Gran Torino, named after that beautiful 1972 car that even non-car lovers should have the respect to admire and drool over. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski could be summed up basically as an amalgamation of some of his previous characters I've mentioned above earlier but the character isn't without his own unique aspects, including by communicating with a growl that would and should scare away in the bravest of men. The character comes out with some truly terrific one-liners that remain stuck in my head including: (note: The following first line is edited for prohibited reasons) \"Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.\" and \"How many swamp rats can you get in one room?\" or \"I used to stack ***** likes you, five feet high in Korea, use ya for sand bags.\" and its brilliant one-liners like these that only an actor like Clint Eastwood can deliver to perfection.The story follows retired Korean War Veteran who is recently widowed and is a man who keeps a iron-fisted grip onto his prejudices despite the ever-changing world around him. The tough-minded and incredibly unhappy old man sets out to wage a one-man war against the Hmong gang members of the neighborhood whilst attempting to reform a youth who was forced into the gang and attempting to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino.Eastwood makes an effective decision in casting actual Hmong actors in the film and it comes off as very authentic and makes for a more authentic story. This decision also gives us two very young wonderful talents to watch on the screen Bee Vang as the shy Thao and his feisty sister Sue Vang Lor.The film is a take-no prisoners thrill ride and I don't mean that in action terms for this is definitely not a high-octane action blockbuster, but a beautifully told story of life and death through the eyes of a man who has seen more than his fair share of it. 0.18746296296296297\n",

I got my turn to be verbally busted and people love to see how you can take it and what your worth is. In the end, Walt viewed people by their actions and respect was earned. I think Walt learned a few things about other people in Grand Torino. In the end the right person earned the Gran Torino.

Rarely has Mr. Eastwood been more effective and entertaining, and for a career as successful as his, that's saying a mouthful. The movie itself is good, although there are some glitches in the plot and some overly contrived dialog. But the basic story is solid, with themes relating to social change, ethnic tensions, gang violence, aging, family tensions, and immigrants. Most interesting is the portrayal of members of the Hmong community who at first seem utterly out of place in its American setting but soon becomes apparent that they too share American values, both positive and negative. The movie also does an effective job of dramatizing ethnic tensions between minority groups. The main star, however, is Mr. Eastwood and his character Walt Kowalski around whom the story revolves. This movie is certainly worth watching and provides good entertainment. 0.2722027972027972\n",
      "Walt Kowalski is a retired Detroit auto plant worker and Korean War veteran, who is newly widowed. When Thao, an Asian-American kid who lives next door, unsuccessfully tries to steal Walt's classic car, the pair form an unlikely bond ...This is yet another low-key offbeat quality drama from Eastwood, with rich characters, a powerful bite, wry humour and and an exceptionally well plotted script by Nick Schenk. The story is full of poignant metaphor and juxtaposition. Walt is a bitter and xenophobic hardass - a sour, judgemental old man who doesn't like anything in the modern world and does his best to withdraw from everyone in it. The fact that he gradually comes to accept his neighbours, enjoy their company and supports Thao far more than his own children is compelling and ironic, summed up by the line where he says, \"God, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do my own spoilt rotten family.\". His final self-sacrifice not only mirrors his experience in the war (in reverse) but is the last creative act of a man who has spent his whole life literally fixing things. It's a great story, full of surprising scenes and in many ways it fits perfectly with Eastwood's classic antiheroes, presenting us with a man who is deeply flawed but who achieves redemption through positive social action. It also has a unique aspect in the portrayal of the Hmong characters (mountain people originally from areas of China/Laos/Vietnam), a very specific ethnic group I don't recall being featured in any other movie. Thao and Sue put up with Walt's relentless slurs and racist language but they see beyond his offensive exterior and teach him more about why he is the way he is than he would have thought possible. All the performances are good, particularly from the Hmong actors, almost all of whom had never been in a film before. Eastwood fans should also note the smooth, subtle score written by his elder son Kyle (and featuring a cool end-title song performed by jazz/pop singer Jamie Cullum) and the smart cameo by his younger son Scott as Sue's luckless date. For motorheads, the car is a 1972 Ford Gran Torino SportsRoof, an earlier version of the old TV Starsky & Hutch Striped Tomato copmobile.

      "Clint Eastwood hasn't disappointed since Mystic River. I've seen all the movies he's made since then, excepting Flags of our Fathers, and I always walk out of the cinema in awe at the talent of this man. Simplicity, good writing, a powerful story, and strong performances are the tools he uses to craft unique films.In Grand Torino Eastwood graces us with one of his performances. I've always considered him an under-appreciated actor, and I don't think he's improved with age: he was great as early as the old Sergio Leone movies of the '60s. In this movie he plays Walter Kowalski, a widower enjoying retirement in a neighborhood which has been occupied by Hmong people. Bitter at life, and feeling abandoned by his family, he can't help throwing racist epithets at them; but this is clearly a defense mechanism to keep people away from him.Slowly he befriends two siblings living next to him and even starts acting as a father figure to them, including to Thao, a confused teenager who's being courted by gangs. Walter, a Korea War veteran, thinks he can fight violence with violence, and things only escalate from there to an unpredictable conclusion.If this be Clint Eastwood's final performance, it'll be perfect. He makes a 180 degree turn from his famous tough guy persona. In Unforgiven he played that persona as if on steroids, making William Munny the most vicious angel of death in the West. But Walter Kowalski is an older, wiser man who knows violence leads nowhere. His final solution to Thao's problem is an amazing send up of his man-with-no-name and Dirty Harry characters.Complementing Eastwood's directing and acting is the usual clever dialog, especially between Walter and his friend Martin (John Carroll Lynch in a lovely role), the melancholy music by Kyle Eastwood, and the tight editing that leaves out everything superfluous. This is a little gem of a movie, which deserves to be cherished by film lovers forever. 0.09485827664399094\n",
      "I normally like Clint Eastwood and was looking forward to seeing what I thought was going to be a good movie, but sadly Gran Torino turned out to be a piece of total nonsense. Like some other reviewers. I feel compelled to give a review and 1 point, just to decrease its average. I just cannot see how any intelligent moviegoer could possibly give this 9/10. The acting is horrendous and the plot is so contrived as to be laughable. Three quarters of the way through, I was getting so bored I was just willing it to end. Honestly, if this is the best Clint can now come up with, then he really would be better off retiring. Why is he such a one-dimensional and predictable character in everything that he does? 0.09078947368421053\n",
      "Clint Eastwood confronts, with the power of an old man who has not lost his memory of the crimes of the Korean War generation, what those crime have transformed him into: a racist, self-centered, extremely bitter person who has become a recluse in his self-righteous expiation of his past, and this expiation takes the color of the total rejection of anything that is not white and wrapped up in an American flag, not seeing that this turns the flag into a shroud, the shroud of all the basic principles of these United States of America. But Clint Eastwood is a man of epiphanies. So he works an epiphany out of this horror. His neighbors are from a Laotian tribe that fought with the Americans in Vietnam against the Communists. Circumstances bring the young boy of this family to trying to steal, on the order from a gang of young people of this community, the Gran Torino collectible car of our Kowalski. Of course he is interrupted and yet spared a bullet that would have killed him. Why? Because Kowalski had done that, had killed a young boy, one day in Korea and that crime is still haunting him. Circumstances will lead him to helping that boy and his sister out of difficult situations with that gang but also with some blacks. He does that on the spur of the moment and along the line of his long cultivated guilt that has to find a salvation after the death of his wife and the discovery that he is spitting blood and probably has lung cancer since he is a heavy smoker. The gang though does not take an intimidation for an answer and certainly not for a final and uncrossable warning. So they go further in their victimizing that boy and girl from next door, a lot farther, and Kowalski take the case in his own hands, at night when he is sure the whole nest of killing predators will be assembled and he comes out of the night, on their front lawn, with dozens of witnesses all around to provoke them into killing him, in fact over-killing him and thus freeing him from his guilt and his disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time. The best part of this film is the giving away of his possession before and after his death. He dares give his silver star to the young Hmong boy Tao before dying, and will his home to the church of the young Irish priest that had forced him into a sacrificial and Christian attitude and his Gran Torino to Tao again. Clint Eastwood in his old age seems to be cleaning up his own house and home, I mean his American mind and soul and that great Spring clearance takes the form of an admirable and at times compassionate or pathetic sidewalk confession and garage expiation. And that is so reassuring about the transformation that is taking place in the USA right now under our eyes, watered that it has been and still is by the blood of millions more victims, US or not, of two more wars in two more foreign countries that had asked nothing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID 0.053079906204906206\n",
      "Gran Torino is Eastwood in one of his finest roles. Eastwood is fantastic as the disgruntled, bigoted, ex-Korean war veteran who has become recently widowed. Now his character not only has to deal with life alone, but life with an Oriental family next door. Being an ex-Korean vet, his dislike for the Asian culture is evident at the onset of the film. Gran Torino is a wonderful character study of a man who learns to deal with his prejudices of others, of a man who learns to respect another culture and a man who learns to become friends with someone who he would have never looked twice at in his earlier years. It shows how a man changes from someone who hates a person to someone who becomes a strong male influence on that same young person.

He is forever a favorite and I pray we get to enjoy more from him in the year's to come.BRA-VO, Mr Eastwood!👏It is such a heartfelt and touching experience watching, as I grew up in a neighborhood very much like this in the 60s and 70s (we were a very blended area).Gran Torino and all those involved with its production portrayed that people can come together no matter race, religion, ethnicity, social status or heritage, based on the enlightenment the lead character growing beyond his initial racism to a man of honor who sacrificed himself, knowing he would be dying soon, for the safety and fulfillment of others' futures. 0.3274074074074074\n",
      "Clint Eastwood responds to the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men with Gran Torino, a film that represents America's senior citizens' strike back. The aging movie star well into his 60's makes it very clear that this is HIS country, and he isn't about to let Koreans into it. Unlike William Butler Yeats (from whom the title \"No Country for Old Men\" comes), Eastwood refuses to go sailing to Byzantium to escape the hardships of being an old man in a young country full of gang bangers and quiet Asain boys. The movie makes No Country's Tommy Lee Jones look like a pussy; he cannot handle the new violence in America. Well Clint Eastwood certainly can; in fact, he's the one making the violence! GO CLINT! Old people still have their Gran Torinos and their rifles, and they're not afraid to take either out into the street for a joy ride. 0.19624500499500502\n",

It has it all: a terrific cast including newcomers Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley and veteran character actor John Caroll Lynch; a terrific story by Dave Johansson and Nick Schenk; great direction by Clint Eastwood and everything a great movie needs to succeed. This is a tribute to both Clint Eastwood the director and Clint Eastwood the actor. I don't understand why it didn't do better at Oscar time. If there's a moral to the story, it's \"don't judge a book by its cover!\" Human beings can learn an excellent lesson in behavior just by watching this film.

      "I wonder what a movie like 'Gran Torino' portrays? Making you feel good to see intermingling of cultures and someone of different race sometimes standing by you for the cause of humanity or making you feel bad to see all those bulling by the gangs and opportunistic approach towards elders. Or does this make you feel ugly that the generation of today is so much motivated by violence, revenge and abuse? All these questions are highlighted in this more than 100 minute long movie. No doubt, Eastwood carries his age with perfection. A war veteran not broken, this stuff is always shown in most of the movies. I think that is a bit unrealistic. What this movie basically answers are the questions pertaining to the war. How are war fought almost 60 years back still makes someone capable of making a strategy to find the solution of a boiling situation. How an old guy suffering from cancer thinks so different from the younger generation when it comes to facing a violent challenge? That is what we get to learn from 'Gran Torino'. Respect, patience, sacrifice. Yes, it has a lot of feel good factors. So, it might sway from realities on those fronts. Its a nice blend, though. The cache is for the viewers. 0.05\n",
      "It is hard to imagine a duller and more boring film than this one. The number of gross inconsistencies in character development, and highly improbable scenes are enough to make one wonder why time and money were spent making this film. Clint Eastwood's performance was a reprise of his earliest western films in which the tough guy staggers through the inane script. The appearance of weapons in unlikely situations can not be explained, and were obviously used to show how tough the main character was supposed to be. Apparently, his death at the end of the film was a vague metaphor for an even more illusory cleansing, but who knows what was meant? The entire film was so improbable that it seemed interminable.

This was the first movie in a while that my parents and I watched together (I'm 15) with everyone feeling satisfied. Not only is the acting good, especially by Clint Eastwood, but there is also a large amount of humor in film. The way my parents were laughing you would think we were watching a comedy. I try to make a point to see as many movies as I can in as wide of a variety as I can whenever I can and to be honest I've seen a lot of not so good movies, but every once in awhile a rare treat like this comes along.

It would be less than a great shame to verging on the catastrophic should Eastwood not make another film in either (actor/director) capacity but if it has to be he need not feel even the tiniest shred of shame in a swansong of this calibre.

I live in central California, which is home to a huge Hmong population. I deal with them on a daily basis with my job, and this movie gave me so much more insight into their culture. Walt Kowalski was a bigot, who uses so many racial epithets like they were common everyday things to say. But, in the end, he had a really big heart. You saw his character evolve, along with the character, Thao Lor, the young neighbor who tried to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino. I loved the movie and will be buying the DVD when it comes out.

      "Clint Eastwood proves ones again that he is a master filmmaker actor and even at this age he is so bloody good. This is about Walt Kowalski- a veteran of the Korean war who is of an old mindset. This movie entertains. It does so with a sly undercurrent of humor mostly from the crusty Walt. The other characters are rich and well portrayed also. Key to the story is the developing father/son relationship Walt grudgingly initiates with his teenage next door neighbor Thao. I will not spoil that as its pure golden. Walt Kolwalski is a real curmudgeon that, while vile, is so funny you gotta love him. Though we never meet his wife we know she was the absolute love of his life. He's old too and perhaps is facing an eminent decline, possibly soon as we are led to believe. Against this backdrop he faces head-on his mortality and his wishes to have done things differently...Not the least of which are his regret of not being a good father to his sons and, even more importantly, not seeking God's forgiveness. When he decides the situation he and his Asian neighbors are caught in must end he seeks a resolution within which he constructs his own brand of redemption. A must watch. 0.14867724867724869\n",
      "When we first see protagonist Walt Kowalski he is at his wife's funeral looking disapprovingly at his family. They clearly have little in common with the old man and have little room in their lives for him. Back home Walt is alone with his dog feeling like a foreigner in his own neighbourhood; all the other European Americans have left and the Hmong who have moved in seem totally alien to him. Thao, the boy who lives next door is being pressured by his cousin to join his gang and as part of his initiation they want him to steal Walt's prized possession; his 1972 Ford Gran Torino. He tries but Walt chases him off. Later they try to force Thao to go with them; Walt might not like his Hmong neighbours but he won't sit by and watch",

His actions make him a hero to the local community and when Thao comes round to make reparations for his actions the pair gradually bond. Walt also becomes friends with Thao's sister, Sue. He helps Thao find work but the problems with the gang are only going to get worse and, after they brutally assault Sue, Walt realises he must confront them again.There is a scene in 'Dirty Harry' where his new partner is told how he hates everybody equally regardless of their race",
      " it seems Walt Kowalski is the same character forty years on. He certainly appears bitter and is offensive to just about everybody: Blacks, Asians, Italians and Irish he uses non- PC language to them all. Over the course of the film it becomes clear that it is mostly just his gruff manner; he is just as insulting to them and expects them to give as good as they get. Clint Eastwood is reliable as a director and an actor and in this film he does a fine job in both roles; the gruff Walt Kowalski is the sort of character it is hard to imagine anybody else playing. The supporting cast do a solid job; most notably Bee Vang, who plays Thao; Ahney Her, who plays Sue; and Christopher Carley who plays Father Janovich, a young priest who seeks to help Walt even if he doesn't want to be helped.Anybody expecting 'Dirty Harry' style action will be somewhat disappointed; there are a few bursts of violence but that isn't want the film is about. It a tale of redemption rather than revenge as Walt tries to save Thao from a life in his cousin's gang and in doing so atone for the act that haunts him; an act that earned him a Silver Star in Korea. As the end approached I feared a cliché finale but that was avoided in a way I never expected but in retrospect was the right end to the story.

This is a good film, with a fine script and Eastwood is excellent in the role of the cantankerous old racist. What lets this film down is the supporting cast of 'unknowns'. To say some of the acting from them was not at its best, well that would be an understatement. Bee Vang is trying to act on a par with Eastwood and fails, he instead comes across as wooden.

It's a healthy mix and it doesn't run itself over with pointless and poor drama/humor films. It's simply amazing and brilliant. It was very emotional and great to see Clint Eastwood at his last work.

It seems fitting that a person of his era show that even things as strong as racism can be over come if your willing to try.

      "There comes a point in \"Gran Torino\" when enervated Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) suddenly swaps angry speech and action for something anomalous. The change of pace is brisk and perplexing. For the longest time Walt's behaviour attests to an embittered human, content to snarl at what he views as profoundly obnoxious with the modern world, yet with no hope of being able to change a single thing. He can attempt to maintain his way of life - and does, such as when he hears noises from the garage holding his most coveted possession, or when he forces a youth-led melee off his property - but the years have not been kind in his attempts to encourage others to accept his way of life. The moment I was intimating towards occurs in a bad side of town, which Walt just so happens to be unofficially patrolling.

But I really didn't know what to expect with such a... sui generis plot.The first five minutes of running time set the movie's tone and send you a message of what to expect. We are in front of an unconventional plot with black comedy, drama, and magnificent character development.Clint Eastwood delivers one of the best performances in the past years. His role as Walt Kowalski is like a gift from Heaven for those who can't get enough of his talent. He's badass but suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's also capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor.The racist jokes and commentaries suit very good with the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao \"Toad\" Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance. But the boy demonstrates he's a very good actor. This on-screen duo is But not everything is happiness. Some sad moments will even make you feel mad and hate the gang members. But Walt Kowalski is an old seawolf and knows exactly what life and it's burdens mean.So through his experience, fierce attitude, badass behavior, and unique sense of humor, he teaches Thao a lesson of life.Extraordinary Direction. Fantastic cast that is completed with Christopher Carley as Father Janovich and Ahney Her as Sue Lor. Father Janovic receives plenty of insults and bad attitude from Walt but still has the patience to convince him to \"change\". Walt teaches him that changing his vision towards life is not the solution. In fact, it's what makes him such a complex and sui generis man. Sue adds the tender, sassy, intelligent girl attitude that feels like fresh air in the plot. The rest of the Lor family is very endearing and tender. Specially the grandmother who \"hates\" Walt.The score is outstanding. Fits perfect with the most important situations. Although the plot and direction may you think it looks like a Hallmark Television production; the cinematography and art direction is splendid that makes it look dark but with a positive vibe.This is by far one of the better movies of the new millennium. Extraordinary display of power by cinema. It reminds us that life is better via all kind of situations.

It is hard to believe that a story so well told has a screen writer with only a few films to his credit and a story teller who Gran Torino is his first writing credit. The writing is very much ahead of the experience of these folks and with Eastwood Acting, Producing & Directing, this film might just be his best triple crown accomplishment.At 78 years young, Eastwood does not look the same on screen as Dirty Harry did, but he is every bit the professional actor fully matured. This film flows on the screen in a way only a few films made today do.It begins with Walt Kowolosky (Eastwood) at the church at his wife's funeral. Then it goes on to show his missing relationship with his family. The focus then goes to the neighbors who are a different race and culture but grow to accept Walt for who he is and what he does. Walt is a Korean vet & retired autoworker who helped assemble his Gran Torino, his pride & joy in the film.The story is very well told as the family next door fills in the void from Walts wife & the detached sons his life has become. It is the last American living in an inner city neighborhood & how he comes to cope with being alone. Walt is plainly ill coughing up blood in the film.My spoiler is that in a way, this masterpiece of Eastwoods has very much the same type of theme as John Wayne's last film, The Shootist. Where Wayne chose to go out much the Western Hero in a blaze of glory, Eastwood chooses in this film to go out loved by his neighbors for what he did, but still very much the man with no name, only now he has a name to the neighbors while the family has missed it all. Is this the way Clint has chosen to finish his career? To me, this is going out on top. 0.11369791666666668\n",
      "All I knew of this move was the trailer I saw on T.V. but after hearing so much about it I decided to see it. Clint Eastwood gives a performance top notch. The character Walt Kolaski is someone we all probably have met at one time in our lives or at least seen in our neighborhood. The old man whose house your told to stay away from. But what you did not see and what this film shows is after a tragedy Walt realizes he is alone in his life and the outside world has changed. This film could very well have been based on a real person maybe it was.There is a humor and a great deal of suffering throughout this film.It shows that life is short and full of change. See this film! If it is truly Clint Eastwood,s final film (I hope it is not) he has defiantly gone out on top. 0.2197916666666667\n",

      "Last time I cried over a movie, was when I saw E.T. for the first time. Clint Eastwood's directing- and acting skills just seems to improve with his age. Million Dollar Baby was amazing, and it truly touched me deep inside, but not as much as Gran Torino. The relationship between Walt Kowalski and Thao- and Sue Lor, the way he talks with his friends, the way he sticks to his principles and especially the way he acts around the priest made me laugh out loud lots of times.Gran Torino deals with lots of themes e.g. social mobility, shallowness, crime, forgiveness, a second chance, braking with the norm and salvation.I recommend this movie for everybody; especially you people who normally skips this kind of movie, going through the shelves in Blockbuster, this movie may actually be very relevant to you.I can only say this much without giving away any spoilers, do yourself a favor, go see it - you won't regret it. 0.17372549019607844\n",
      "Clint Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a typical working class hero. Kowalsky is a Korean War vet with a natural xenophobia and several racial hang-ups, but with the natural goodness all men of integrity have. His character is truly believable. It is no surprise that the movie grows in you as the plot develops. There is a progression in his character occurring in a swift and unexpected direction. Kowalski goes from racial disdain and an equal opportunity hater, to a friend and a father figure for two young Hmong teenagers. He becomes a better friend and father to two total strangers than to his own sons and grandchildren. This flick is a must-see for every movie lover. 0.16666666666666669\n",
      "One of Clint's absolute best. I love this movie. I have to admit the humour can be inappropriate at times, but you can see Eastwood's influence all over this movie. To the casual observer this movie may seem cruel and heartless but when given a chance it really shows tough love a great heart. Some of the jokes and comments made are very racist, and a lot of F-bombs, not for people who are sensitve to these kinds of things. On the surface Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) seems to dislike his Hmong neighbours but deep down he really does love them, as is revealed as the movie unfolds. At times you might wonder where the film is headed, if anywhere, but seen to the very end you finally get it!! One of the best of his illustrious career. 0.1808641975308642\n",
      "There is certainly an idea of a made in-USA pride running through the whole story, with shots of Eastwood on his porch in front of an star spangled banner and a Ford Torino; three icons that are worth the price of the ticket, not for rhetoric itself but for the way they summarize the film's idea. The story was not written for Eastwood but it certainly feels like it was. The director has always tried to explore the ageing process of American society with a dose of sarcasm and very genuinely. In \"Gran Torino\" as well the audience will see a mix (quite eccentric actually) of violence and humanity, everything in harmony with the setting and the ambiance of many other Clint's works. 0.18235714285714283\n",
      "Gran Torino was an excellent movie! just as other comments said it is a comedy and a drama at the same time. Clint Eastwood definitely directed this film excellently. at some parts, it was hilarious with Walt's funny crackled voice but at other times you just feel like shriveling up and crying. The ending is definitely an extremely powerful ending which shows the themes of peer pressure, devotion and sacrifice:P I'm not really good at themes:P.Gran Torino is definitely a great movie and is absolutely worth watching. i believe it is one of the best movies i have ever watched. WELL DONE CLINT EASTWOOD!! 0.31071428571428567\n",
      "Decent 80 minute movie compressed into 120 minutes. I don't care if it's Spielberg, Eastwood or Ed Wood, a movie produced and directed by the star is not going to be a good movie due to scene bloat.Awful acting (or was it just growling) by Eastwood also. Pat Morita would have done (and did) better. This really is a weak Karate Kid knock-off, had they acknowledged this by putting in at least one \"wax on wax off\" line, it would have been marginally amusing. As it stands, it's just marginal.I wonder what people who rate this way up in \"Godfather\" land charge studio hired marketing firms to do that. Is overhyping films on IMDb the \"$80 an hour miracle job\" they advertise on Facebook that is taking the country by storm these days? 0.14583333333333331\n",
      "Clint Eastwood's \"Gran Torino\" arrives in cinemas just two months after \"Changeling\" and it's another winner. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a widowed, grumpy, bigoted, no-nonsense war vet who takes a young Asian boy (Bee Vang) under his wing after he catches him trying to steal his Gran Torino, a car the Ford Motor Company cranked out in the 70's. Vang has been targeted by a gang of thugs who want him to join their directionless cause; Walt sees some potential in the boy, so determines to cultivate it. A short summary can't do justice to the complexities the film addresses. Eastwood's Walt is one of the screen's great characters, a flawed Everyman who's been left high and dry by his wife's death and the changing social environment around him. The character spouts a torrent of racial slurs and seem steadfast in his refusal to accept another culture and its inherent rituals. The first half of the film mixes violence and bitter comedy as Walt clashes with the thugs and gradually warms to the ways of his Asian neighbors. The film's second half explores Walt's rebirth as he schools his charge in the basics of responsibility and the finer points of social intercourse (a couple of hilarious sequences here). He also clashes with a well-meaning priest who promised Walt's late wife that he'd extract a confession from the atheistic old bastard. Eastwood works his magic to deliver a very compelling, totally involving drama that ends on a solemn, powerful note. This considerable accomplishment furthers his legend. 0.09102564102564102\n",
      "This is one of the very best movie's i have ever seen. The humor is of the kind that men make. I mean salt of the earth men! Construction workers, Men at war, Man who know what kind of emotional baggage comes with that kind of work. I enjoyed the hold back style of the movie. The straight to the point remarks that a man in that situation would make in real life. A man who has seen too much in this world to be \"hollywood correct\" A real movie about a man with a big heart and the emotional baggage that comes with that heart. A man who believes in values that never should be forgotten. I hope Mr Eastwood has shown the way that movies could be like and should be like to the next generation.

      "This film caught my attention without watching any trailers or reviews. I immediately became immersed in the character as I felt every grunt and moan he made as his character dealt with the unwelcome change of his departed wife and new Asian neighbours. At first I thought they were cantonese but it seems there's more to than that.Clint rejects everything that comes his way, if you've seen Jim Carey's latest flick you'd say \"he's a NO Man!\" and gradually he comes around and discovers new friends and essensce of life.I also love the flat American neighbourhoods where the front lawns almost touch each others, seems like a nice open community geographic.

      "Cute little film but overrated. Warm human story of strange friendship that offers the warmest sincerity in this rotten world against all odds is nice and deserves attention. However, the story even though emotional and warm is somehow dry and raw and lites only the surface of our hearts. I think that Eastwood has followed the patterns of the Hollywood style to concentrate on the plot to affect our feelings more than to try to develop the characters more carefully as well as their mutual interactions with him as the main hero. On the other hand, I love the charming way he introduced all the stupidity of prejudices based on racism and especially implied it during the Asian party he was invited to. It must be very hard to direct and play the main role in the movie, so I certainly send all my respect to Clint Eastwood's work in this movie. I do not agree with some people regarding the comments on bad acting in this movie especially Clint's. I think that he fits very well the character he played. 0.10028388278388278\n",
      "I grew up on Eastwood. My parents are huge fans; they actually saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in the theater 3 times when dating. I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in. When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one. Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling. I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him. When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him. Through this they become friends. Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant. Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.The movie is about the car but isn't. Everyone wants that car, but only the one deserving will get it in the end. My mother warned me the ending was not what I'd expect and boy was she right. I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about. I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.This was an excellent movie, you must watch and own. Truly an Eastwood best. Imagine Dirty Harry old and meaner and you have Walt. This movie is now one of my favorites, right up there with Sudden Impact, The Good The Bad and the Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, For a Few Dollars More, A Fistfull of Dollars, just to name a few of Eastwood's movies that will never grow old. 0.08427579365079367\n",
      "This was a nice little film but it seemed forced to me at times. The ethnic slurs were rampant. OK I get it Clint wanted to make it a point that he was a bad ass Korean war patriot or something like that and he can say what he wanted at anytime. Mr. Eastwood basically played a disgruntled bitter old man wishing for the 50s to come back. He had no passion for his children nor did they for he. He seemingly was a loyal husband now left a widower with his only passion his GRAN TORINO... hence the title. Trouble brews with the Korean family next door and Clint who at first does not like these Koreans, grows to be their friend, savior and mentor. The big bad Clint comes out saves the day over and over with various predicaments leading up to a grand finale with a gang. In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but thats just it . I do not see it as an award type movie for various reasons. The ethnic jokes and other comedic situations basically told me is the movie did not know where to go, than throw in a wet behind the ears baby faced priest and you have a silly movie. I was entertained so I guess that is the bottom-line in all this . Do not expect a shower of awards from this movie. -0.022048611111111102\n",
      "OK, either the definition of \"good\" (as in 8.1/10 at the time of writing) has changed or I just didn't get the movie. I really wanted to like it because as a stereotypical guy (as glorified tongue-in-cheek by the movie) I automatically am a big fan of anything Clint Eastwood. Here are my main gripes: Firstly, some material was quite out-of-place, e.g. the visual gag of the old woman out-spitting Eastwood. A movie that has a rape in it, that was just lame. I don't know, maybe that was a artistic way to show the subjective threat felt by Eastwood of the Asian neighbors or whatever. I just thought it wasn't really funny.Another scene that was in essence awful was the scene where Eastwood's character teaches Thao how to talk manly. The first scene with Eastwood and the barber \"conversing\" was pretty funny because of the acting (reminds me of older movies in which there's so fast dialogue it's hard to keep up) and it didn't explain anything (even if it was out of place in a pretty dark movie) but the second time it was ruined by step-by-step explanation why they insult each other. It's an old joke guys and girls are different.Another annoyance of mine was how easily Walt (Eastwood) turned non-racist after 70-some years of grade-A racism. It has to be the fastest conversion since two previous records held by American History X. The character was great otherwise, yet another one of Eastwood being honest and acting old but still bad-ass. Which brings me to another thing: I really expected the final scene be something like what Stallone did in the latest Rambo. Now it was probably realistic etc. but come on, ever heard of blue balls? That reminds me, how did Walt be so certain that his death would be any different than anything else the gang did and managed to intimidate people to be quiet about? I felt one of the themes was frustration and not being able to fix things as they are, but in the end the movie sort of gives in and lets things lay in other people's hands and so the viewer gets frustrated (maybe that was the point, though. In any case I would have preferred something Dirty Harry would have done).Lastly, Jamie Cullum. OK, I got it the titular Gran Torino was symbolic of Walt's inner self being hidden in his garage etc. etc. but come on, I don't thing anyone needs Mr. Cullum's annoying voice to spell it out.Overall, there was a lot of good in the movie but there also was a lot of bad, especially when looking closely. I don't know if I would look as closely if it wasn't Mr. Eastwood, probably not. I hate to say it (and probably look like a racist bigot when I say it, but I have no friends anyways so here goes) but maybe the theme of racism plugs a string which makes most people forget anything bad a movie would have. Movies that discuss racism are of course important but they should do more than play that old card. 0.06450766747376918\n",

Eastwood's the only 78 year old man I know that can still capture the screen so crisply after 50 something years of acting and 30 something years of directing under his belt.

      "Ever since I saw Dirty Harry on TV when I was 10, I have always been a Clint Eastwood buff. I have seen all of his films at least twice. I am probably one of the last people to see this film in its theatrical release. I put off seeing it for two months and I think the reason was I read Eastwood said it is his last film. I thought it would be a depressing experience, after all who wants to hear the last word on Clint Eastwood. However, this film is first class and I think its wonderful that Mister Eastwood has gone out on top. In his first acting role since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, Clint shines as Walt, a man out of step with his times. He has just buried his wife and they make it clear at the beginning he has no relationship with his children or grandchildren. A Korean war vet and retired auto worker, he has an Archie Bunker view of the world and the \"gooks\" who live in his neighborhood. However, circumstances occur that make him examine his prejudices and in the end redeem his troubled soul. Next to In The Line Of Fire, I consider this Clint's best acting job. He makes you dislike Walt's prejudices but still feel for the man. He has a great scene where he angrily tells that troubled young kid about the horrors of his war and the guilt of killing and how it troubles you all your life. Eastwood is so great at playing characters that are tormented by demons of guilt. He has done it so well before in Unforgiven, In The Line Of Fire, and Million Dollar Baby. It says so much for Eastwood's toughness that he can still play a tough guy role and still fight with fist or gun at an age when most people are trying to remember what they had for breakfast. I also wanted to mention he does an excellent job directing this fine film as well. Eastwood is so low key that most moviegoers don't realize he heads his own production company, Malpaso productions, and directs most of his own films. He has won two Oscars and even critics who have derided his acting have praised him as an outstanding director. SPOILER Alert, this movie and The Beguiled are the only Eastwood films where his character isn't around at the end. However, we cheer Walt at the end because he shuffles off this mortal coil heroically and with a purpose, like a man and with perfect dignity. We rejoice for him, because we know that he has at last found the redemption and peace he so craved. Well done Mister Eastwood and enjoy your retirement. 0.19424735156442474\n",

      "How can an awful movie like this one get so many good votes? Now that i think about it, there was nothing i could appreciate about this movie. Not only it was boring as hell but also quite cliché. The horrible acting of those teenagers made it rather hard to watch sometimes, so i just had to look away from the screen. The young boy who plays Thao really needs to learn to act and speak better (i couldn't understand most of the things he'd say). Also Mr. Eastwood's attempt at trying to be funny was pathetic i thought. The scene at the barber shop where Mr. Kowalski (Eastwood) is trying to man up Thao was supposed to be funny or at least make me smile but instead it was really lame and it failed to do any of that. This movie could have been a bit better if Eastwood had picked a better cast of actors and not just some kids who know nothing about acting. On some scenes, like the one where Thao's cousin and his gang beat up Thao or the scene where Mr. Kowalski beats up the fat guy from the gang, the violence looks completely fake.

Plenty of that shines through in Gran Torino, gruff, cold and a dark sense of humor. But Gran Torino takes the character development so much further. It makes Eastwood a deeply complicated person, struggling with how rapidly the world around him is changing when all he wants to do is be a regular guy: mow his yard, drink beer and the only company he needs is his dog. The meshing of these two elements, tough and real, take Eastwood to a whole new level and if I dare say it, make the ultimate character in any movie I've ever seen. -0.12609427609427606\n",

      "I watched Gran Torino yesterday. Being a big fan of Clint Eastwood and his films I was very much looking forward to seeing this film and as far as script, directing and plot went it didn't disappoint.The dialogue was great and it is definitely one of the more interesting scripts with a great character development process (especially with the main character) and a touching and rather surprising ending.Clint Eastwood proves in this film that he should be recognised as being among the great film makers and actors of his generation.However... Something needs to be said about the god-awful casting of this film.Bee Vang, who plays the main supporting part of Thao in the film has got to be one of the worst actors I have ever had the displeasure of seeing on screen. Granted he's a first timer, but in my opinion that is not an excuse. Throughout the film, his complete and utter lack of acting talent is enough to make you cringe yourself silly. He is completely wooden and unbelievable - one particular scene that involves him banging on a cellar door in frustration is so amateurish that the entire emotional side of an otherwise well-written scene is completely lost on the audience. Hopefully, and most likely, Bee Vang's acting career will be nipped in the bud after this.The other supporting characters were also very bad. Thao's sister was marginally better than the others but her performance still left much to be desired. The scene in which she returns after being brutalised by her own cousin is very poorly acted and she seems emotionally unaffected by the whole thing in the scenes that follow.All in all, Gran Torino is a brilliant movie that is ruined by bad acting, and although acting is not the whole movie it is one of the most important aspects. The whole feel of the film is pulled away from the viewer when they are forced to endure such horrendous performances.However, I plan on seeing this film again soon. Now that I know what to expect from the supporting cast I am prepared for it and may be able to emmerse my self more into the story.If the acting had been acceptable this film might very well have received 8 or even 9 stars from me.7/10 0.12805084745762713\n",
      "Clint Eastwood in this film reminds me of my grandpa Hasan, though not entirely, some of the decisions made are precisely decisions I could see my grandpa making if he were alone and surrounded by a neighbor changing from what he knew it to me as he grows older. I had a connection with Walt (Clint Eastwood) for that very reason. From a character development standpoint it was perfect, he started out a grade  to everyone and everything, souly based on his past experiences. By the end of the film, he grew to care for this neighborhood kid and made it his dying goal to keep this kid from living the rest of his life in regret and misery.\n",

      "Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is arguably one of the best drama movies ever made as well as being comedic and interesting. The movie stars Eastwood as Walt Kowalski a racist Korean War veteran whose neighbor tries to steal his most prized possession which is a car that is the name of the movie a 1972 ford Gran Torino, also Eastwood's character is miserable because he has a spoiled family doesn't even care about him as well as a granddaughter who wishes he was dead just so she keep that classic car just after they went to his wife's funeral. As D.W. Griffith said when he talked about film making that \"A film with no message is a waste of time.\" this film sends more than one message as a matter of fact it sends 2 instead of one the first one being that it is horrible to have an idiotic family that doesn't love you, and the other being to stay away from street gangs. 0.008333333333333326\n",

      "(This review may contain spoilers) The widower Walt Kowalski is a living in Michigan Korean War veteran, full of prejudices, who has just lost his wife Dorothy. He is one of the last Americans of European descent in his neighborhood, has no good relationship with his sons and their families and is therefore a lonely man. When Thao the neighbor boy is forced by his cousin to join its gang, he must steal the Gran Torino of Walt as entrance examination. But he gets caught by Walt and his family is ashamed of this incident. Later, Walt rescues Thao first exposed and then his sister Sue against gang members and sees the gratitude of the neighborhood. On the birthday of Walt Sue invited him to their family celebration and he slowly begins to take a kind of neighborly relationship and helps Thao get a job. He recognizes, however, that the gang terrorized the neighborhood and after an attack by the gang, Walt decides to take a decisive step. He goes to the gang and provoked them until they have shot him. At the End Thao become the Gran Torino and not the family of Walt.Walt Kowalski is a bad-tempered old man who had once worked in a car factory. He is also is full of prejudices and do not like foreigners. He likes to drink beer and to speak sometimes with his dog. Thao is a shy young man who submits to other people, and doesn't give commands to other people. He does all, what others tell him. Sue is a live friendly person who likes to go to other people and speak to them without fear. For example: She is the only one in her family who speaks with Walt without fear. Pater Janovich is a friendly person who is aged between 30 to 40 years. He is helpful and listens to other people with their problems.The camera always shows to the person who speaks at the moment. The camera only shows the \"importantest\" of all. No unnecessary things that could belong to the film. Only what suits the plot.Why is the title of the film \"Gran Torino\"? The choice for the film car fell on a Ford Torino, because the screenwriter Nick Schenk lived near a Ford factory.Why is the car so important for Walt?

The way the plot unfolds is masterful. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 30 minutes to prepare for the climax, which leaves me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt this overwhelming sadness in me. Yes, \"Gran Torino\" is really that profoundly moving. It is a must watch. 0.13921568627450984\n",

      "Clint stars as Korean War veteran, retired Ford Motor employee Walt Kowalski, living in Detroit. He is a widower. Tough as nails, not very friendly. Has two sons, but is distant in relations with them (understandably, once you get to learn about them). He is just about as politically INCORRECT as a guy can be in 2008. So if you are into political correctness big time, you may not like this movie. But as the movie progresses, viewer comes to realize that inside his incredibly CRUSTY exterior, Walt really has a heart of gold. The family living next door to him are Hmongs, from the hills of Laos. They are steeped in tradition. But after getting way off on the wrong foot (the Hmong son is practically \"forced\" by cousins/ gang members to try to steal Walt's Gran Torino!), the two households grow closer and closer. Walt becomes their bodyguard in a way. The Village Idiot cousins refuse to back off, and Walt decides to take a drastic action. But what endeared this movie to me were some of the quotes. After Hmong women continue to bring him food as a thank you, tho he tries to resist, he is overcome by them and says, \"Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

I will use the film to start an analysis on moral character. Other people say it is a parabole, and a Christian parabole. But for me it is a reflection on culpability. The life of Walt becomes idle until he confronts a gang asault and violation, but yes he has his demons from Korean War and he must get freed from them. What ar his motives of not confessing his war murder at Korean war? I would tell this film is a psychological thriller, since only at the final scenes you find out all the internal thinking of Walt.

      "What makes a film (Or any piece of fiction) a classic (Or not), is the degree in which you care about the characters. Was Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) racist? Yes he was. But so was Archie Bunker and Sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in \"In The Heat Of The Night\". But deep down they are decent people who will do the right thing in spite of themselves. Perhaps the most revealing thing was when Walt realized that the Hmong People that he looked down upon, were actually far more decent and had more honor then his own family. His family were nothing but vultures who cared nothing for him, and were waiting until he died, so they can sell everything that he had (In particular, his prized 1972 Gran Torino), and essentially his life would become meaningless. Spoilers ahead: When he was willing to sacrifice himself (Thus making sure the gang what raped Sue, and terrorized the Community, would no longer be able to do it again), and even more importantly by donating his house to the Church (Which is what his wife wanted), he could receive salvation, and help others in need. Perhaps most important, by giving his Grano Torino (And although not stated, but heavily implied) his mint condition tool set, and thus a job to Thao (Bee Vang). When Walt is able to get Thao hired, one of the first questions asked is does he have his own tools? When you see the final scene with Thao and his girl friend in the car, you can see how much he appreciates the gifts Walt gave him (Based on the condition of the car and his improved attitude). In effect, Walt will not be forgotten about, and although he failed with his own family, he succeeded in accomplishing something good with Thao and his family, and through him, he will not be forgotten about. 10/10 Stars. 0.24326676907322067\n",
      "***This comment definitely contains spoilers***'Gran Torino' presses all the buttons it aims to, and joins old-time Western movie values with contemporary issues in a comfortably liberal way. The ending is nice and resonant, though the final funeral and will-reading scenes were probably too much. Just show Thao driving the GT with the dog, huh? And without the singing. For a moment, I thought he had a tape of Walt in the car.A lot of people who marked this down seem not to understand Walt's motivation to change, which I suppose is a script shortcoming. When Walt gets the report back from the doctor and then tries to talk kindly to his son for the first time in years, the message you're supposed to get is that he's looking at weeks, months at best till he joins his dead wife, and I don't think the horror of that finality comes across as well as it should have. Walt's reaction to the news - which was really no reaction at all - was true to life, but cinematically dull. Whatever Walt was ill with (strong hints at advanced lung cancer) is left unresolved, and that doubt and his indifference somehow undermines the ultimate passionate decisiveness of his character. It must have been a deliberate decision to let the ending resolve that doubt, but I think this is a dilution of the theme, and the film suffers for it.It's not a ground-breakingly original film, it's not supposed to be. It's very solid, nicely photographed, wistful and warming comfort food, with some wry and sharp lines from Clint peppering it throughout, and there are some wild allegorical touches to think about in the odd slow bit (like the whole somewhat formulaic priest thing). Gran Torino does a good job of triggering emotions at all the right points, and we should be thankful for the fact that people are still making movies with that in mind. You'll hate it if you're uncomfortable with having your heartstrings tugged in the old-fashioned way. But then you probably drive a Korean car. Me, I drive a 25-year old Mercedes.

      "Star and director Clint Eastwood was rumoured as retiring from acting after this film, if that is the case he has made a good final performance. Basically grumpy, tough-minded, widowed automobile assembly worker and Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) wants nothing to do with anyone, not his kids, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) or even his new Asian neighbours, no-one. The only possession he really cares about is his mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino, and his new neighbour, teenage Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) tries to steal it. Thao's family are disappointed in him, and they insist that Walt lets him work for him, fixing things for a week as punishment, and doing this Walt does show some humanity. Thao is getting beaten badly by a gang run by his own cousin, and soon enough it gets to the point where all his family get involved in the attacks. Walt sees no other choice but to protect Thao and his family from the dangerous gang attacks, and the final scene is a very brave move for him to make, also being the last. Also starring Ahney Her as Sue Lor, Brian Haley as Mitch Kowalski, Geraldine Hughes as Karen Kowalski, Brian Howe as Steve Kowalski, Dreama Walker as Ashley Kowalski, William Hill as Tim Kennedy, John Carroll Lynch as Barber Martin, Brooke Chia Thao as Vu and Chee Thao as Grandma and Scott Eastwood, Clint's son as Trey. Clint is fantastic in both the serious scenes, towards the end especially, and with his humorous grumpiness with one-liner put downs for everyone. It takes a little while to get to the really interesting stuff with the gangs and danger, but Clint keeps you engaged both on screen and behind the camera in a most watchable drama.

      "I luckily saw this film and it is a great film, opening up the dialog between changing times, cultures and just doing the right thing. Clint Eastwood brings his charismatic charms as the rough neck American who had served in the Korean War, where it seems some psychological trauma still haunts him. After the war he is leading what seemed to be a good life, having two sons and taking care of his Gran Torino. However, it is the typical, mid-western attitude that grows into a more understanding that everyone is human, which brings the film up a level.As Eastwood's character begins to see his age is beginning to take on a final run on him, he discovers his pals and old neighbors are no longer. The neighborhood is not what it used to be, his kids are not what he had imagined they would be and most of all... he is bitter and battered... something the Korean War scarred him with. And now his neighborhood now being populated by the Hmong/Mong people of asia (near cambodia and Vietnam).Through a series of events, the story also takes place around his neighbor's young boy who is a good kid, too young to be bad. But is cornered by a gang into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino. The Hmong family finds out what happened and also see that Walt helped the young boy when the gang came up to take him. This opens up communication between the two neighbors... in his own way, Walt grows a little, heals a little and becomes bonded with some of his Hmong neighbors who keep bringing him food and gifts (Hmong tradition) for his good deeds to his neighbors. At first, he is confused and resistant, but eventually warms up a bit. It is touching, great character development and acting on Eastwood's part. Using no name actors brought authenticity to the film, it became that much more believable and down to earth.However, as one grows fond and attached to the characters, the greatest deed is done at the end by Walt, in what seemingly may be his way of forgiving himself for the horrible things he did in the Korean War. I really liked the film, Eastwood is one of my favorites and I thought lately thing were drying up for him, but this revived his renaissance.

Elienated by his two sons, Walt is a widower who lives by old laws. By random he becomes the unlikely friend with neighbours Sue and Thao of the Hmong people. The rest is a dramedy, turned tragedy, turned revenge/redemption. Walt has lung cancer. We never hear the word, but it's pretty clear and at last stage. It's not important per se for the story, but says alot of his character. Selfmade, he don't tell anyone. I'll easy rate this as Clints finest performance since Million Dollar Baby. He actually kids around with his old macho image. The hmong kids both do a very good job, likable, just as you feel disgust for the gang tormenting them.

      "Clint Eastwood's last performance as an actor (so he says) could've been worse. Gran Torino is not on par with his other recent masterpieces like Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby or Changeling but it has heart. Clint as Walt Kowalski looks and acts like Dirty Harry in his golden days yelling at kids to get off his lawn, but with much more of a mean, bigoted streak. But, slowly he changes his ways thanks to a Hmong family that has moved in next door, being terrorized by a gang of Hmong thugs. He especially takes to Thao, their teenage son, whom he catches trying to steal his prized Gran Torino. Clint's character arcs in a positive way and although he maintains his racial epithets, we find they are terms of endearment. He uses them on everyone he knows. Clint's acting is sharp throughout the film, this isn't exactly a new character for him, only more seasoned and willingness to be open. A good metaphor for society in general. Not sure if the Hmong actors are new but they are rough around the edges. The best of the bunch is Sue (Ahney Her). Aside from predictable moments, it is a good film. 0.07887931034482758\n",
      "When we first meet Walt Kowalski, the bigoted but lovable curmudgeon played by Clint Eastwood, he's coping with the loss of his wife of many years. During the funeral and reception at the house afterward, his sons are shown having a hard time coping with their father who doesn't have a good word to say about anybody. But soon it's clear that the film's scenarists are setting us up to view Walt as misanthropic but at the same a far better man than his offspring who are busy with their own lives and don't have their father's best interests at heart. Worse is the granddaughter, a narcissistic teenager who shows little sensitivity during a tragic time of grief (the portrait of the detached granddaughter, completely one-dimensional, is designed to contrast with the much more real and sensitive Sue, the young Hmong woman, that Walt is soon to befriend).Sue, played by the excellent Ahney Her, is probably the most engaging character in the film. She's the one who gets Walt to open up as she brings him over to meet her family and introduce him to the Hmong culture. Not only did I enjoy the banter between the two characters but had the distinct impression that Ms. Her was not actingthat she was simply playing herself! Every time Walt would make an ignorant, bigoted remark, she wouldn't get angry but simply contradict him and explain why he was wrong. He opens up to her precisely because of her patience and insight into both her own people and the outside American culture. She's an all-knowing guide and in a sense hearkens back to the 'wisdom' character in the Bible and other ancient writings.To the screenwriters' credit, gang culture is not sanitized. Not only are members of the Hmong gang shown to be what they are (vicious and aimless young people who want to make everybody else's lives miserable) but the black gang members are also shown to be equally vicious. And even better, most of the Gran Torino story is not about the gang members but the relationship between Walt and the two young Hmong people who help him to find some purpose in his life.As the Gran Torino story unfolds, certain things don't ring true. One thing that bothered me quite a bit was Walt's complete ignorance of who the Hmong people were. Here's a guy who presumably has been living in this neighborhood for many years, all his neighbors are Hmong people, and it's up to Sue to explain to him where the Hmong came from. Despite his prejudices, Walt is not a stupid person. He would have known the difference between the Hmong and say the Vietnamese people simply from his conversations with his friends in the neighborhood (such as his friend the barber, the construction foreman or any of his buddies at the various bars he frequents).Gran Torino is full of 'trash talk' mainly emanating from Walt's foul mouth. Walt and his barber friend trade occasionally amusing insults about each other's ethnic identity. Whether such conversations actually take place in real life is another issue (how a barber would actually like a customer who never tips him seems completely far-fetched).Most of the middle of Gran Torino concerns Walt's quest to turn Thao, Sue's brother, into a 'real man'. Thao doesn't have much of a personality like his sister and his gradual transformation from a shy, detached kid into someone who's hardworking and responsible seemed a bit too predictable. It's hard to believe that Thao is such a complete wuss that the macho pep talk from Walt's construction foreman friend will so easily turn him around.The film's climax is the least believable of all the scenes. We're asked first to believe that Walt would jeopardize Thao and Sue's safety by beating up one of the gang members. After all, he's the guy who later locks Thao in the basement after preventing him from impulsively taking revenge on the gang members. But earlier, Walt is the one who commits the impulsive act which leads to Sue being raped.Now he must undo his own mistake. In a nice twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence. Perhaps 'Dirty Harry' is maturing in his old age. Furthermore, Clint seems to be softening slightly toward the Catholic church (here he's finally willing to go to confession in contrast to his diatribe against the church's stance against mercy killings which was prominent in Eastwood's earlier film, 'Million Dollar Baby').Nonetheless, the filmmaker's desire to give the audience a bittersweet but upbeat ending by suggesting that the gang members will end up being prosecuted rings false. Why would the neighbors suddenly be willing to testify against the gang members when it's established early on that everyone in the neighborhood is petrified of gang retaliation? No, in real life, odds are that the witnesses wouldn't have come forward to testify against the gang members despite Walt's heroic reputation in the neighborhood.Gran Torino is not always honest and goes out of its way to manipulate your emotions. Nonetheless, it's deftly plotted and will keep your attention throughout. That's no small feat. For all its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing. 0.1056845238095238\n",

      "Gran Torino is a movie about Walter Kowalski, an old veteran who recently lost his wife and seems to have no feelings at all. However this is just a facade of his, he is actually very concerned about the people around him.The movie starts with Walter having the worst day of his life, it is his wife's funeral, his family is there and he hates that, and worst of all, some Asians move in next door. That last part is very important, as Walt hates Asian people.The people that moved in next door are a big family which has two very important characters, Thao and Sue. They are Hmong people. Thao has a cousin that is part of a gang, and this cousin wants Thao to become a member of the gang, and to achieve this he harrasses Thao in many different ways. Thao agrees to form part of the gang but first he has to do an initiation mission: steal Walt's Gran Torino. Thao fails and Walt catches him during the act, making Walt hate his neighbors even more.During the rest of the movie we see the change in the relationship between Walt, Sue and Thao, transforming from a hate relationship to almost a Father and children relationship.The movie has some racist comedy moments and sad moments that made me like the movie even more.The ending is kind of anti climatic but shows how much Walt changed along the development of the movie.I really enjoyed almost everything about the movie except Thao's acting, it wasn't very good at some moments of the movie, but leaving that aside, this movie is very good. 0.029999999999999995\n",

The supporting cast also followed through in a major way, despite not being big faces in the industry, yet. This movie astounds the viewer as a result of its creation of tension, and subsequent deliver on the plot lines.

      "Rumor has this being Clint Eastwood's last acting performance (please Mr. Eastwood don't do it!!) But if he did decide to retire from acting Gran Torino would have been the most brilliant and effective swan song he could have thought of. The man stars, directs, and sings in the film but that alone doesn't make it brilliant. The sheer power of the film is what makes it incredible. Gran Torino is this intense and amazing character study led by the absolutely mind blowing character of Walt Kowalski created, played by, embodied by Mr. Eastwood. The character is probably the most unlikable, growly, peculiar, twisted of Eastwood's characters and yet he comes full circle and has such a huge character arc and goes through so many changes. The real brilliance is that you know Kowalski has a history, and so much has happened to him that has grated on him and made him very bitter about the world around him. It isn't really about the races around him, or his rude demeanor towards youth, and different cultures but just about the things that have happened to him in his past. While you never really discover details you know the history is there drawing you into the story and this man's life.Clint Eastwood is Hollywood royalty and I am biased because several years ago I became an instant adoring fan of Eastwood both as an actor and director. Still certainly you have to have a taste for his performances. Certain people can say that Eastwood is the same in every role but if you look closer you will see Eastwood has some definitive talent in really lighting up the screen. Eastwood's Kowalski will most definitely be remembered as being an amazing character with a great arc and he was robbed of getting no award nominations at the Oscars. Christopher Carley has a small role but pertinent and quite well done as the very young Father Janovich, who tries to reach out to Walt without much luck. Carley does very well opposite Eastwood in a small role. Ahney Her is brilliant as the feisty young Hmong neighbor Sue who is the first to really lock horns with Kowalski and win him over with her quick wit. She does a terrific job and should have gotten more notice for her part. Also brilliant and really a key to the film is Bee Vang who becomes Kowalski's partner, friend and misplaced student of sorts. The two of them, Eastwood and Vang, are just brilliant opposite each other. Vang's character goes through enormous changes throughout the film and the two of them really play off of each other.The film's pace is not break neck by any means and yet you will find yourself completely enthralled! The film will shock you, make you laugh, cry, and be amazed all at once. It is funny to me that people don't find the film offensive, or at least that I've heard, considering the amount of racial language and crude comments are used but it seems to be acceptable in the context used in the film. Eastwood's flare for direction hasn't changed. He knows how to bring the most out of his characters and make the story feel so incredibly real. You owe yourself to see this beautifully made, incredibly captivating drama. It will leave you wide eyed and breathless and you won't be disappointed. 10/10 0.19946344735077134\n",
      "I've noticed many negative comments about the supporting cast....that there acting is poor, and un-professional. I'm sure most understand that Mr. Eastwood selected his supporting cast purposely from a group of untrained amateurs. For me, that's precisely why the movie works so well. Having worked with young people from the local (Fresno, CA) Hmong community, and having first hand experience with the Hmong culture, I wouldn't have expected the young actors in this film to \"act\" any different. They are totally natural. That, in conjunction with the wonderful story line, is exactly why this film feels so real. Great job Mr. Eastwood. 0.23157894736842108\n",
      "Great movie! Bravo Mr. Eastwood! As well as I join those who loved this movie, I think this one was also especially for those who liked \"Seven Pounds\" by Will Smith, where Will showed some persuasive acting, however, the basic idea of \"Seven Pounds\" really sucked - i.e diagnosis: \"un-trivial-exotic form of suicide from unbearable sense of guilt with further distribution of spare organs in attempt to justify oneself\" instead of providing valuable honest longterm service for people.In \"Gran Torino\" Mr. Eastwood's character has shown us real man's Courage and has made true Sacrifice for the love of people (not guilt).

I'd thought I'd seen my share of movies that dealt with black/white issues, and of course this is Asian/white issues, but I was afraid the similar premise would take us to all too familiar of a place. But it's not. It's something more about young and old, honor and fear, and just good old right and wrong that proves that Eastwood has a grip on both the society we live in and the movies we want to see.

Angelina Jolie is one of my favorite actresses and her performance in Changeling was just pathetic - you can't have a character keep expressing the same one-dimensional emotional response without it becoming flat and meaningless. Eastwood directing himself has the same problem. In Million Dollar Baby the performances were boring and pointless - and in Gran Torino they are just sad.

      "Two days ago and before I went to see Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino on the big screen I was seeing the bonus material from the DVD of Classic Albums: Pink Floyd - The Making of 'The Dark Side of the Moon'. We have some short videos with Roger Waters and one is titled 'Waters' World View', in it Roger says: \"that's something I always had, when a was a teenager, when I was the chairman of the YCND in Cambridge when I was 15 years old",
      "if you've been given the I think gift of having that perspective you don't lose it and I suspect",
      "a member of the Ku Klux Klan",
      "I think is likely that you go on, wanting to lynch people forever, maybe not, maybe I shouldn't say that, maybe there's an optimistic side of me that feels that not just individuals but authorities are capable of rehabilitation\".In Gran Torino Clint Eastwood did what will be his last performance and he is just terrific as Walt Kowalski, veteran of the Korean War who now is practically the only American, or maybe one of the few, living in the neighborhood, for him is not a trouble to go out with his rifle when his Hmong neighbors are in his lawn. In a South Park episode there's this thing that when a Muslim boy is the new student Eric Cartman is immediately thinking \"terrorist\" and Cartman goes on certainly without any reason to think that but just because the boy is Muslim. The big thing is that when Cartman alerts the police (and I think even Bush) they actually end avoiding a possible attack so in the end is like \"after all it was the racism of Cartman what saved the day\". I'm writing this because there's this part in Gran Torino when one of Walt's neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang), is being bothered by his cousin (Doua Moua) and his cousin's gang and the whole problem ends when Walt goes out with a loaded riffle. Walt added another reason to dislike Thao, apart of because Thao is Chinese, when he caught him trying to steal his AMAZING 1972 Gran Torino, Walt dislike Thao's family, and his own family actually, but after the incident when he made that Thao's cousin stop trying to persuade Thao to join his gang Walt became a hero to the neighborhood, certainly Walt just wanted the gooks out of his lawn but he saved Thao.Gran Torino begins when Walt's wife just died, now he will be alone and that worry his two sons since they know how their father is however and of course that doesn't really worry Walt. You can imagine Walt's relation with Mitch (Brian Haley), one of his sons, if I write that Mitch works for a Japanese automaker (Walt worked for the Ford Motor Company) plus Mitch's daughter has piercings and stuff. In short, when Walt dies his two sons, and their respective families, won't inherit Walt's house and 1972 Gran Torino. Walt never found the way to be a true father and certainly he regrets that as other things from his past as a soldier, from the time when he earned medals for killing. But Walt will feel something new, he will find something and he will find it with the people that he never intended to have any kind of relation with. Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) is the one who will take Walt with her family, a new culture for Walt and is all part of an extremely entertaining film, now with Walt and Thao doing stuff together, a feel good part of the film (just hilarious how Walt talks with his Italian American pal and that part when Walt brings Thao to the barbershop just like when Thao presents himself with his future boss are just fantastic!).Despite rating Gran Torino with a full 10 and Changeling with 9.5/10 I actually think Changeling is a superior film yet Gran Torino is now for me a new personal favourite. Actually if you see both Changeling and Gran Torino it does feel like we have two complete opposite films from Eastwood, Gran Torino for most of its time is a feel good movie with a lot of fun. Anyway, 2008 was a terrific year for Clint, his last performance is very memorable, his 1972 Gran Torino is a beauty (and will be in good hands), do yourself a favor and see both Changeling and Gran Torino. 0.15285676966711448\n",

      "Gran Tarino is the story not of a car but of a man who discovers that there is a meaning to his life. The problem isn't that his life is difficult. The problem is that he sees no reason to enjoy life. A dead wife, distant kids, and a neighborhood falling apart around him, give him the idea that there isn't much to live for. It will be two unlikely friends who will change his mind.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is bitter. Alone and single, living in the house he has called home for years, he can only sit and watch as the world around him descends into what he sees as madness. Immigrant families moving in around him, gangs running around his neighborhood, and his own sickness, leave him little to hope for. Every neighborhood has that one old man who is angry and Walt is very much the local angry recluse who would rather use racial slurs than smile and say hello. Walt also has little problem sharing his feelings about Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), the priest his wife confided in before her death. Not only does Walt seems to hate Asian ethnic groups, he hates religion and devout priests.Next door a Hmong immigrant family has moved in. Shy and timid Thao (Bee Vang), and his bold sister Sue (Ahney Her), live with their widowed mother and attempt to fit into both Hmong and American culture. The problem is that when a local Hmong gang attempts to \"recruit\" Thao, they find themselves on the defense. It is then that their paths will cross with their racist neighbor who will become a kind of father figure and hero not only to them and their family but also the local Hmong community.Gran Tarino is a story about redemption. Not only for Walt, whose bitterness begins to fade as he slowly befriends first Sue and then Thao, but also for Thao himself who finds himself forced to redeem his honor after his attempt to steal Walt's Gran Tarino. The two are opposite in almost every way but they will learn from each other important truths that both needed to discover. Walt, insensitive to cultures different from his own, will discover that he enjoys spending time with immigrants he once despised. Thao will learn from Walt courage and the strength to stand up to those around him. Walt will also learn that his past experiences in the Korean War, experiences that have haunted him to this day, no longer have to be the burden they always have been.Some have complained about the acting by the Hmong actors and actresses used. However, there was a sense of cultural realness in the use of Bee Vang, Ahney Her, and the other Hmongs. The use of these new actors and actresses along with the experience of Clint Eastwood was a contrast that worked well for Gran Tarino. Walt's character seemed more real in dealing with kids and not professional actors. The dialogue was more valid and seemed realistic in terms of the cultural and age differences.There is some plot weakness that holds back Gran Tarino from being a notable classic. The conflict with the gang feels tacked on at times and distracts from the character development of Walt and Thao. Clint Eastwood's direction is notable, but the writing itself is weak in terms of trying to create a more vivid conflict. A more powerful conflict would have been Walt dealing with his own cancer and his struggling relationship with his two sons. Walt's death is a Christ like moment where he is the savior for Thao and Sue but also the one being saved himself. A touching ending, but one that felt forced.One of the best films to showcase Clint Eastwood's talent as an actor and director, Gran Tarino is worth watching and good ending to a career that has lasted over three decades. Not a perfect movie, but one that will be remembered as one of Clint's most humane stories.8/10 0.08734307359307358\n",
      "\"Gran Torino\" is a funny movie. There are comments that it is a \"racist\" film but it's a film about racism which you can't make without racists.Monsieur Eastwood found all sorts of opportunities to be funny but I liked when he found himself in the neighbor's basement with a bunch of kids, leaned against an unlevel dryer, got down and adjusted it. That was a beautiful, almost embarrassing, funny \"old man\" moment that was unexpected and so real. The machine is unlevel, get down and fix it. Totally unimportant to the scene but perfect.\"Watch out for Mr. Kowalski. He'll beat up your cousin, fix your dryer and make you like it.\"There were some improbable scenes in this film like Walt being able to get close enough to the gangster to throw him down the stairs and the gangsters not spotting his white Ford pickup tailing them or across the street. Whatever. It was worth it to watch him mow the lawn.Though it was a set-up for a joke, I could have lived without the barber-shop scene where Thau is being trained to trash-talk. But this is a film where Eastwood is playing an imperfect character who smokes, drinks, hates people and can't express his emotions except with negativity. He's playing the nasty, old racist next door and he does it well. Perfect characters make for boring films. And the punchline really was pretty good.It was a great moment when he spat with disdain at the old Hmong woman and she out-spit him. God knows what she was spitting and it's unlikely that Walt would chew AND smoke but it was funny anyway.When the Hispanics brought out their gun and the Hmong brought out their machine gun, that was funny. CE didn't shy away from finding humor in subtle places. Both the Hmong and Hispanic car drivers where wearing the same headbands in the same style.Since the gangs may have been a metaphor for street soldiers, it's interesting that they started out defending Thau and tried to indoctrinate him but were ultimately a badguy gang of cowards.Someone has said that Clint is playing a character here who supports war but that's not the message I got. Walt seemed to regret his memories of the war and participation in it.C.Eastwood really is perfect in this film and the supporting players were understated and natural.Walt didn't miss a philosophical beat dealing with Thau's immature idea that they were going to find the gangsters, do some damage and come home unscathed. That only happens \"in the movies\". Walt uses some tricky maneuvering to utilize the \"never around when you need them\" police and legal system to get the gangsters off the scene, save Thau and gracefully put himself out of his own \"dying in an oncology ward\" misery.Walt sticks to his guns and, though he softens, he never gives in to the priestly pap but winds up teaching the priest instead. Maybe Walt learns something about forgiveness but the priest also learns how little HE knows about reality. Walt compromised without giving in. Wow.Since the movie moves along as movies do without giving you much time to think, I didn't realize that Walt was getting a suit fitted for his own funeral. It's the kind of detail that they throw in, don't comment on and leave you to realize at your leisure. They could have thrown in some line from the tailor to make us question why Walt is getting a DARK suit fitted but they didn't and I completely missed the point until later. It was perfectly done since it didn't give away Walt's plan unless you're smarter than I am which isn't unlikely. I missed it.This is a well-written script shot simply and acted amazingly well. 0.15312499999999998\n",

      "Even though this is an excellent film, the ending was predictable and disappointing. I know Walt was dying and the character felt it was a way to resolve the problem. But, I wanted a more courageous ending. I don't mean I wanted him to senselessly kill the punk gang. I just thought there was a better resolve to be had.Walt Kowalski was a wonderfully etched character with complexity and compassion. Clint Eastwood is making really great films in his old age. I can't wait to see his next one. Million Dollar Baby was an exquisitely made film. He seems to be getting past the cliché. Kudos to Clint. 0.2947916666666667\n",
      "Amazing Film...Eastwood one of the greatest movies in years.I saw the film and it was unbelievable. I don't understand why you don't win an Oscar is unfair , you deserve for the great performance in this fantastic movie . Clint Eastwood you are a living legend , I highly recommend this film for all people that like great movies with one of the best actors ever . The film talk about a war vet that is facet with problems that exist in society today , different cultures living together , the film has drama, comedy, action and Clint Eastwood on is best really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again! It was probably the last great movie that Clint made as actor , for now we will see him as director.Congratulations 0.435\n",
      "Whilst I understand why this movie gets good reviews, one thing is missing from a lot of the reviews that is or should be blindingly obvious to anybody who is a movie fan... Which is, its not a very well made movie. The story is top notch, acting from everybody is on the whole adequate but its clear that something drastic went wrong behind the camera. Im of the 'opinion' that eastwood might have been overworked during the making of this film and it shows clearly, poor camera-work throughout, scenes that seem rushed, I know that no two production teams are the same but compared to eastwood's earlier directorial efforts this movie looks like its been made by amateurs.. camerawise anyway. Am I on my own here because no-one else seems to bring up these obvious faults in what would have been a classic movie! 0.06127450980392156\n",
      "Gran Torino is probably Clint Eastood's best film to date. It may be his final performance, though I hope it's not. Gran Torino is sad, dramatic, educational, and sometimes funny. Gran Torino is rather awesome. The Plot: Walt is a retired ex-soldier who doesn't like what's going on in his neighborhood. Tons of Koreans are moving in. There's also a lot of gang violence. Walt soon becomes friends with his next door neighbors Thao and Sue, and shows them whats wrong and teaches them about society. Gran Torino is an amazing film. It really does deserve it's spot on the top 250. Eastwood does a great job as Walt. The gang in the film really are a-holes. The film has a good ending and I was pleased. If this is Eastwood's last performance or film, he's going down in a blaze of glory. From films like Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The good, the bad, and the ugly, and In the Line of Fire, Eastwood has had a fantastic acting career and directing career. I know we all knew that I but i thought i would come out and say it. If this is Eastwood's final performance, i'm saying good bye. The world will miss you Mr. Eastwood. 0.19244444444444447\n",
      "I have not seen such o good...perfect movie for a long, long time. On a very rare occasions one can see a masterpiece worth to spend two hours just to see its end. A final shot, last 5 minutes, last scene. This is such a movie. Simple in its visuals, not overloaded with effects, lacking great words and fine speeches. So what is left? The climax of the end. For this I would sacrify another two hours and maybe entire night. It is like watching last few seconds of NBA final with Jordan.As someone said Eastwood presents a mature art of directing a movie and playing main character. I would say it is even more. He has reached Mt. Everest and still climbing higher. 0.12492063492063495\n",
      "This movie was one of Clint Eastwood's best movies that he has directed and acted in. Clint Eastwood plays the character Walt Kowalski. This movie is great because there are times where it makes you happy, sad, and times you're on the edge of your seat. Clint Eastwood used emotion to drag viewers into this classic film. The surrounding cast in this film isn't anyone impressive, but they do a pretty good job, as most of the movie is just about Walt. A couple more actors in this film are Bee Vang, who plays Thao, and Ahney Her, who plays Sue. Both of these characters are Walt's neighbors.Walt is an older gentlemen who is very lonely, given his wife had passed away. Walt is a veteran having served in the Korean War. He likes to keep up with his home, car and drinks himself a lot of beer. Walt is the typical old style American man as he is very racist, given the time period he grew up in and the things he had been through in life, and in the war. Walt, just like any other veteran, takes a great amount of pride in his service to his country. At the same time, he has to carry around that burden for the rest of his life, which haunts him.During the course of Walt's life, the population in his neighborhood started to change. His neighborhood was a middle class white neighborhood. Years later, it turned into a primarily Asian neighborhood. This made Walt really angry, but he refused to leave where he had lived for many years.A Korean family moved in next door and he couldn't stand them. One of his neighbor's children, Thao, did something that really angered Walt, rightfully so. In order to get into a gang, Thao was directed to try and still Walt's Gran Torino. In order to pay Walt back, Thao got put to work for him. Sue, Thao's sister, came up with the idea, given they did have any money at all. Walt and Sue had changed Walt's mind about many things, just as their opinions changed about him as well.Even though Walt was an old man who was set in his ways, this movie shows you that people can change over time. Regardless of age or beliefs, actions can always change your opinion. The only way to describe this great film is that it filled with ups and downs, with some moments of anger and some moments of happiness. This is a great film for anyone to watch and teaches a great lesson to its viewers. This movie doesn't really have any special effects, as it doesn't need. Clint Eastwood's character, Walt, is one bad old veteran that no one wants to make mad. 0.17327254305977707\n",
      "The plot is stunning, and the movie gets your attention the 2 hours it takes to watch. The development of Walt, the main character is splendid, and the soundtrack is coupled perfectly with the vibe of the movie. The acting is magnificent. I must highlight the performance of Clint Eastwood; you can see the experience when he acts. However, some of the bad guys aren't scary at all, except for the guns, they look like oriental anime fans who got out from a convention.As a fan of sagas like The Lord of the Rings, and movies with mythological creatures and incredible visual effects I don't usually like this kind of movies. Nevertheless, this movie impressed me, I wasn't expecting nothing of it, but the end was fascinating. I could say that it enters in my top 10 non-fanciful movies I have ever seen. 0.3833333333333334\n",
      "even though I wouldn't call this a great film. It was OK, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood plays Walt, a recent widow whom still lives in the old neighborhood surrounded by foreigners. He's racist and mean. What I really didn't like and didn't think very realistic was when they would show him growl and grimace at people just because of the way they looked. It was over the top. The movie is about him learning tolerance and befriended his Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. Walt is shown going to the doctor and spitting up blood. The movie never says what is wrong but it's safe to bet he had some kind of bad disease, so that is supposed to make it better for what happens in the end to Walt.FINAL VERDICT: If you don't mind the language, worth checking out. 0.14824561403508774\n",

      "If you enjoy action, drama, and gangs, \"Gran Torino\" is a movie you'll like. \"Gran Torino\" is an action but mostly dramatic film. It deals with characters that grow close to each other, and relationships that symbolize the tolerance between people of different age and race. The movie includes a fight between the \"good\" and \"bad\"; but this fight is not only between characters, but decisions as well. Even though it includes the typical idea that doing the right thing will always bring you good consequences, the good guys are not the typical guys you would expect because one is tough and rude, and the other one tries to steal; but what counts are the real morals they carry inside. If you are looking for a violent movie with constant action, where the violence that occurs does not affect you emotionally, then don't watch this movie.The movie is about a man named Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) who's a Korean War veteran. He is a grumpy, bitter, tough, old widower, whose greatest possession is a 1970s Gran Torino. The story takes place in a neighborhood in Highland Park, Michigan. At the beginning of it, Walt's neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), tries to steal the car in order to be part of his cousin's (Doua Moua) gang. Nevertheless, Kowalski saves Thao one night from getting into trouble with the gang, but with no real emotional motivation. Kowalski becomes the hero of the neighborhood, and Thao, who is a Hmong, is forced by his family to work for him as a sign of regret and forgiveness. After several weeks, Walt becomes very close to Thao and his family, finding himself forced to protect them; including his sister Sue (Anhey Her). Throughout the movie, Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) is frequently visiting Walt; and the visits provide interactions and conversations relevant to the portrayal of Kowalski's emotions and personality.Clint Eastwood who played Walt Kowalski's role did a great job. He portrayed his character in a very realistic and strong way. With his tough character, he was able to evoke feelings on the audience. On the other hand, Bee Vang's and Ahney Her's acting was very poor. They were not able to strongly portray their character and seem real. Their acting was fake and unsatisfying. Ellen Chenoweth, the casting director, and Eastwood, as a director, did an awful job choosing the actors.There were a few things I liked about the movie. First, the images and the cinematography were fascinating because of the different camera angles and movements; you could tell they were well planned to make this technical feature support the mood of the story. Tom Stern, the director of photography, and the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach, surely did an excellent job. Second, the end of the movie was unexpected and added a whole new different feeling to it. Third, what I found most interesting was how there were lots of stories left unfinished and ready for the audience's interpretation. Many details remain unknown and the movie motivates us to infer. For example, we never know why Walt's always having to throw up blood, and we only know a few details from his past. This opens up the possibility that he might have been a terrible man who killed many, but we still feel compassion towards him. Even though I liked these aspects, in such a strong movie, good acting is vital. As I said before, Her's and Vang's acting was terrible; therefore, a lot of emotions were lost. How is the audience supposed to connect with these characters if they seem so fake and so unnatural? Moreover, there was suspense but nothing interesting really happened, except in the end. I felt no real, intense conflict; no sense or point in the plot. In other words, I did not feel the movie. The lack of experience of the actors and the slowness of the story brought the work down; it was certainly saved by the ending.Nevertheless, the movie included several interesting topics and themes. I learnt about the importance of solidarity and tolerance, and the respect elders deserve and how they should not be underestimated. Also, being interested in the wrong sense of the word, is never beneficial; but doing the right thing is.I would probably recommend this movie to young adults. Maybe adults would also like it, but I don't think they would be that interested. The movie is rated R, probably because of the language used, and the violence we don't actually see, but know that happens. I feel it was a good, respectable movie, but not an extraordinary, amazing one. The movie was well done; the images, the camera movements, the dialogue, and the story were all good, but the mediocre acting on behalf of the apparently neophyte actors, affected the movie terribly. Maybe it was even that acting that caused the movie to be uninteresting and not to catch my full emotional affection towards the whole situation. In other words, maybe I did not find it character driven as it was supposed to be. 0.06597826637300322\n",

      "Gran Torino is one of Clint's finest performances. He plays a grumpy retired, racist Korean war vet that becomes a hero of the neighborhood for preventing neighbor Thao from being taken by his gangbanger cousin. Walt had no intention of helping his Hmong neighbors, he was just trying to get them off his lawn. He ends up finding a kinship with his neighbors and a bond between them grows. While bonding with Thao and teaching him to become a man, he learns about the Hmong culture and ends up giving up his racist ways. The film the takes a dark turn as is expected when dealing with gangs. This is very well put together overall with a lot of wit and humor with one of Clint's most powerful performances in front of the screen. As one of Clint's biggest fans, I sincerely hope that he is not done acting yet. I didn't think I would like Trouble With The Curve, but Clint is great in that too.

      "The two main themes of this film I thought were: acceptance and courage. Walt Kowalski was an older man who believed that only Americans and American made things were important. He was a Korean War vet who learned only to trust his own kind. He had lived in the same neighborhood and house for years, but after time the neighborhood was slowly overpopulated with Koreans. At first, his neighbors annoyed him, because of their Korean heritage, and he wanted nothing more than for them to move out. However, his excessive name calling and stereotypes slowly began to change throughout the movie. Over time, he began to get to know his neighbors for who they really were and helped them overcome challenges in the lives. Tao, his neighbor, tried to steal his 1972 Gran Torino; this infuriated Waltz and he despised Tao for awhile. He eventually helped Tao become a man. Walt became a good male role model for him when he took him under his wing and got him a job and showed him responsibility. In return, his neighbors helped him to overcome challenges. For example, judging people, name calling, being cold hearted, and being selfish. The theme played a huge role in making the film important. Without acceptance and courage the conflicts would've never been resolved. Also, Walt would've never learned his lesson. The theme of the movie was based on Walt and what he gained from the film. This set a good example for others with prejudices and stereotypes. Two techniques that were relevant to the films theme were: the angle at which the film was portrayed and motifs. The repeated stereotypes that were used throughout the film along with the director's angle made the film complex and intriguing. Another film that comes to mind that deals with this related theme is American History X. Courage and acceptance were two big issues throughout that film that had to be overcome. Racial issues are nothing to fight about; acceptance is the main reason that god made each of us unique. Dialogue, conflict and the acting were all elements that made the movie entertaining. They all worked together to provide a great storyline that taught a very important message at the end. Sometimes we need to watch movies like this that involve prejudges, or similar scenarios in order to understand why people feel and act certain ways. This can open our eyes to many things (explanations, reasoning, admittance, etc.). 0.15921245421245425\n",
      "Great car. Great entertainment. Just like the 72 Gran Torino in the movie is a classic, this is a classic Clint Eastwood movie with all the classic Clint Eastwood elements here. The only difference is this film has a softer heart to it and a message of non-violence. But Clint Eastwood can still make a line like \"get off my front lawn\" sound like \"make my day\" from 'Dirty Harry'. And unlike most of the Eastwood films of the past this is essentially a family flick. Cute kids, cute dogs, cute little old ladies, family values messages like don't join gangs. Need I go on?I like Clint Eastwood, but his films can be a little too hard ass and macho for me, that's why I liked this. Good values.

      "******Possible Spoilers*****\"Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have f***ed with? That's me.\"Clint Eastwood is back and better than ever in his small masterpiece \"Gran Torino\". Eastwood is remarkable as Walt Kowalski, an old man who's wife has just passed. He's a hardened war vet who'll give anybody the cold shoulder(especially his family). Walt is the last of a dying breed, living in the Hmong ghetto. The world isn't the way that he once knew; teenagers show disrespect to their elders and parents want to get rid of their elderly parents. It's a vicious cycle that Walt wants no part of.Early on in the movie, a Hmong family moves next door to Walt. Of course, Walt does not bake them a cake and take it over to them like a good neighbor. Instead, Walt pays no attention to them as he mumbles racial slurs. Now, up to this point in the film, Eastwood is playing a rigid,bitter,and cold hearted old man who's just waiting for his time to run out. However, this all changes when Walt decides to protect his neighbors from a gang. \"Get off my lawn\", Walt snarls, pointing a rifle at their heads.The next day, the Hmong neighbors start to ravish Walt with gifts. Walt kindly declines buy taking the gifts and throwing them in the trash while the neighbors are watching. Did I mention that Walt is an a$$hole?Eventually, Walt begins to warm up to his Asian neighbors by accepting to go to their cookout. Then, Walt starts to bond with the Hmong boy,Thao, who he saved from the gang. Here's where the beauty of the movie comes into play. Walt realizes that the Hmong people, that he has verbally abused for more than fifty years, are more like his family than his own flesh and blood.Eastwood has always been an amazing actor; whether he was a tough as nails cop as Dirty Harry Callahan or an elderly gunslinger as William Munny, Eastwood is always on top of his game. The character of Walt Kowalski is portrayed flawlessly. It is one of the very few movies that actually makes me forget that these are actors \"playing\" their character, instead of actors \"becoming\" their character.This movie is,to put it simply, stunning. Some critics will argue that the movie becomes slow and boring at times, but this is not a movie about blowing s**t up; this is a movie about how we interact with people and judge others with our preconceived notions. I finished this film and felt as though my entire world had been rocked. Everything was better than I expected it to be. \"Gran Torino\" is easily one of the best pictures of the year, and also one of Eastwood's best performances of all time. 9.5 out of 10 0.1444729344729345\n",

      "I can say that I appreciate Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, but I never really liked them personally for whatever reason. Clint Eastwood is a very dedicated and skillful director, and it's nice this time around to see a movie that he both did really well and that I also really enjoyed watching. Those seeing the commercial of his newest release might be inclined to avoid it because of how violent and racist it is, but I appeal here and now that everyone give this one a chance--most of the \"bad parts\", so to speak, are in the commercial, and the rest is pure character-driven magnificence.Eastwood plays Walt, the ostensibly racist Korean war vet that everyone's so quick to compare to grizzled bad cop Dirty Harry, but is actually a whole new anti-hero: gruff, curmudgeon-y, and generally willing to spit in the face of everyone who approaches him, he's just lost his wife and has settled to a life of fending off shallow and selfish relatives while his neighbors' kid attempts to steal his vintage Gran Torino in a gang initiation. From there it's a pretty quick gravitational attraction between him and Hmong family next door, and despite his distrust and general hateful attitude to everyone around him, they warm his heart and low and behold, he finds himself saying things like, \"I have more in common with these gooks than my own family.\" Striking a friendship, he still finds that the family just cannot escape from the gang-activity crawling pestilently around the neighborhood, so he takes the kid under his wing and does what he can to protect the family.I went in expecting one movie and ended up with a much better one. Like some others, I was expecting something more like a Dirty Harry meets Million Dollar Baby, and even throughout the movie it kept feeling like it could rapidly devolve into a vengeance narrative like Taxi Driver; instead, there's a lot of humanistic humor, good-will, and caring behind Eastwood's permi-scowl, and eventually the narrative is more like a mature deconstruction of those very expectations the audience has. Eastwood seems to be revisiting the architypes of his past and redefining them, partially because he no longer seems interested in violence as a justification for entertainment but as a real-world problem to deal with. Still, in this one he seems to be delighting in keeping people on their toes, and there are many things you'll leave with both expected and unexpected.As much as this movie wasn't as \"hard\" as I expected it, it did have a very real and very devastating awareness of just how violent and deadly these things can be. Tension runs high through a lot of it because it's really hard to see such fleshed-out characters get hurt. It's interesting that a lot of movies that have come out recently, like Synecdoche New York, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Wrestler, have been deeply invested in seeing people at the ends of their lives searching desperately for a re-evaluation of their value. Eastwood's particular concern in many of his later movies is redemption. Gran Torino fits right in with recent menu, while also being its own wonderful serving. 0.04311553030303031\n",
      "I have enjoyed every Clint Eastwood movie I have seen, until now.There were numerous problems that I had with this film:1) The plot and scenes were so predictable, it wasn't even entertaining. 2) The acting in this film was absolutely horrid - including Clint's. The lines and acting were so strained throughout the entire movie, I was never able to get into any of the characters. Not even for a second. 3) The movie's message could have been transmitted more effectively with 90% less of the non-stop racial slurs and insults that Clint made throughout the movie. He's a bigot. I got that after the first 20 seconds he looked at his neighbor's home at the beginning of the movie. I didn't need to keep hearing it rammed down my ears every other minute of the movie ... I wasn't going to forget that he's a bigot. 4) Regardless of the situations that supposedly brought Clint closer to his neighbors, it was totally laughable that anybody from the Hmong family would spend a minute with somebody who spouted such vile about them constantly in their presence. It is inconceivable to me that the daughter would bond any sort of friendship with anybody as insanely bigoted as Clint's character. Even if she was helped by Clint, that gratitude would have evaporated within minutes of hearing all the racial slurs made against her, her family, and her people. 6) Is there a dimension less than 1? If so, I would assign that dimension to the depth of every character in the movie. 7) Heck, I was insulted by Clint's character, and I'm not even Asian. After a certain point, I started fast-forwarding through the movie to get past each of his embarrassing tirades. They weren't character development, and they certainly didn't add anything to the movie after the first 10 minutes. 8) Even Clint's constant growling throughout the movie got tiresome. In his earlier films, he didn't have to sound tough all the time. You just knew he was.If I hadn't watched this at home, I would have walked out. I did watch it to the end however, just to see how the main plot line conflict was resolved. (I won't say how it happens, in case you still want to waste your time on this film)Even the conflict resolution was unbelievable. About 20 minutes prior to that resolution, it was mentioned exactly why that supposed resolution wouldn't have worked.Normally, I would have given a film of this caliber about a 4, because Clint's acting would have raised the bar a little. Instead, this gets a solid '1' from me because Clint's acting actually was as bad as everybody else, and I expected better from him.Sigh. -0.0021119929453262787\n",

The terrible things we do to one another, and the flip side, the unconditional love we can have for others and the good we try to do for them. Just my take. Excellent acting all around.

      "Clint Eastwood growls and scowls his way though an impressive, slow-burning drama. It marks another milestone in Eastwood's career as both actor and director, from his early, merciless- killer roles (Dirty Harry) through his apparent realisation of the burdens associated with these acts (Unforgiven).A very poignant tale of redemption, it follows Korean War vet Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) journey towards acceptance of his Hmong neighbours,after young Thao (Vang) gets caught up with a gang and tries to steal his car.This is another masterpiece from a director/actor at the top of his game. Fine support comes from Carley and a cast of Hmong amateurs, only one of whom had ever appeared in a film before.The soundtrack boasts an unlikely duet between toughguy Clint and Brit ivory-tinkler Jamie Cullum.

Two other complaints are 1) the soundtrack is extremely cheesy 2) Spoiler Ahead! When Walt dies it is way too obvious \"Christ-like Imagery\". The point could have been carried out without having him lay down like a crucified Jesus.Overall though Eastwood's acting saved the movie and it is definitely worth seeing. -0.06650326797385621\n",
      "I give this movie a 9, only because, as some other posters have noted, there are a few deficiencies in acting. But Clint carries the movie, so it is easy enough to overlook any other problems with it. It is so nice to see a movie that appeals to adults like myself (I'm 52). I get so mad at the R-rated comedies that I keep vowing never to see one again. This movie is R-rated only for the profanity, and as such, could easily be seen by anyone over the age of 10 (because they will have already heard all the words in school). What is nice about seeing a movie like this in a crowded theater (my wife and I had to sit almost in the front of the theater because we got there right before it started) is you get the mass laughs and other responses. There are PLENTY of laughs in this movie! The racist lead character is funny to view, because we have all probably known someone like him in our past; usually it's not mean-spirited, just ignorant. Clint's character's ignorance is corrected as the movie progresses, and at the end, unless you are as cold-hearted as he appears to be at the start, you will cry! This is a great movie because it tells a great story, and has a pretty good lesson. It reminded me a little of the Paul Newman movie, \"Nobody's Fool\" (a movie, which unfortunately was forced to be R-rated by the producers by a stupid quick nude scene, because they didn't think G-rated movies made money) This movie pretty much had to have the profanity (unless they bleeped it out, which I guess would seem awkward) to reflect some of the low-life characters who abound these days. That is the only caution I would see for children, is that they would get a false impression of how most people talk to each other by viewing this film. All around though, well worth seeing. 0.07137755102040817\n",
      "The movie Gran Torino is a movie about the ability to change. Clint Eastwood plays the part of the ever miserable Walt Kowalski. His disposition is sour after years of bad memories spent in the Korean War. The only happiness he finds is in his dog. He is a widow who truly has no use for anyone else in this world. Living in a neighborhood of immigrants, this bigoted and headstrong individual only becomes more miserable.The strong theme that is shown through the entire movie is the ability of change. Many times people feel that a person is unchangeable; however, this movie proves this notion to be untrue. In the beginning of the movie Walt is cold and distant. He does not show mercy or kindness to anyone but his faithful friend Daisy. When Thao –played by Bee Vang – is caught trying to steal his beloved car as part of a gang initiation, Walt is only more disappointed with his surrounding neighbors. Until Thao is made to work off his debt to Walt, then the relationship begins to develop.This man who was once a hollow shell begins to feel again. He takes Thao under his wing, and teaches him to be a man. Helping him to get a job, \"ask out\" a young girl, and teaching him about pride and honor. His once hard heart begins to soften as these people whom he once despised, truly become his family. One memorable scene is when he stands with his rifle telling the Hmong gang to \"get off my lawn\". Though in this moment he truly just wants these people to go away, he is seen as a hero. His true heroic act is defined toward the end of the movie.After Sue (Ahney Her ) is beaten and raped, and Thao is hurt in a drive by shooting, Walt knows what must be done. Thao is determined that the gang must be punished for what they have done. Walt knows how haunted a man becomes after taking a life, and cannot allow Thao to bear those inner demons. In his heart he knows what this might do to this young man he has grown to care about – and respect. So to show that he is a changed man he goes to church and says a confession – an act that once previously he was completely against. With this action it is pretty clear to the viewer that Walt will lose his life in this battle. He gives Thao his Silver medal of honor and locks him in the basement for his own protection.Eastwood's character has become a changed man through the care and attention of his neighbors. He has had nothing to live for since the death of his wife and the end of the war. However, he now sees his purpose",
      "to save this young man. Going to stand up to the gang himself – Walt does the ultimate heroic act",
      "giving up his life in the name of justice.One of the most interesting tools used in this movie is the wardrobe. Throughout much of the movie Walt is place in a simple wardrobe that depicts the flat and empty personality he possesses. His colors are muted and outfits are kept simplistic. His neighbors Sue and Thao however exhibit a more \"colorful\" wardrobe. Their outfits are more complex with more color – exhibiting the vitality and passion they have for life. This stays constant through much of the movie without too much wavering. However, this technique arises again in the end of the movie when Walt goes to buy himself a new suit and get a new hair cut before his last courageous stand. This shows that he has become a new man. He has been reborn.A man once filled with disdain and contempt",

      "I will echo what I've said in previous reviews. Clint Eastwood knows how to make good movies. He is an excellent director who doesn't waste time with an outlandish amount of takes on set; he always comes in at his budget and on time...and his films are always fantastic! Gran Torino may have a recycled theme that we've seen countless times in Hollywood, but Eastwood finds a way to make it fresh. The movie is two hours long but never has a sluggish pace. Every moment is chosen carefully and furthers the narrative. It also has a strong supporting cast composed of actual Hmong actors which received much praise for not choosing to have different Asian-Americans mimicking Hmong. Like all of his movies, the ending isn't a happy one, so I would encourage you to be in the right frame of mind when you are ready to watch it. Gran Torino may not be my favorite Eastwood film, but that doesn't make it any less great and is certainly more thought provoking than a lot of movies with similar themes. 0.262987012987013\n",
      "Nobody can do it like him. Gran Torino is up there with Clint's very best movies - Dirty Harry, The Good The Bad And The Ugly, Unforgiven, etc. I sat through this movie with a silly grin on my face, laughing at the \"Clintisms\", growing more and more involved with the story, and being touched at the unexpected ending. If this is to be Clint's acting swan song it's certainly a fine way to go out.Clint plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War Veteran who's just buried his wife, is disliked by his own spoiled family, and with seemingly nothing to look forward to except a lonely dragged out last few years of existence. All that changes, however, when he discovers his young neighbour trying to steal his car, a pristine 1972 Gran Torino, in a gang initiation ceremony. After Kowalski scares him off, the gang turn up to goad their would-be-initiate a little further, only to discover it's not very wise to break Clint's garden gnomes...Gran Torino works beautifully, as Kowalski first despises and then bonds with his Hmong neighbours, discovering much about their life and culture to admire. It's also very funny, with Clint's usual one-liners and pithy statements to the fore, and never stretches believability too far. Clint growls like an old bear, and delivers one of his very best acting turns. The support acting may be a little substandard, but let's face it, you're gonna watch this for Clint! He makes his character say many things without dialogue, using expression, posture,etc alone, to get his message across. I've always liked his style. Even Hitchcock had retired by the time he reached Clint's age; long may he carry on when keeps on delivering movies as good as this. 0.12298813236313237\n",

      "This is reported to be Clint Eastwood's last starring role. If this is true then he has most definitely left us on a high. He plays the part of Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski quite flawlessly; in fact I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Walt lives in Highland Park, Michigan, a neighbourhood that is dominated by immigrants, particularly the Hmong (pronounced 'mong').Having lost his wife and being distanced from his two sons, Walt lives alone with his Labrador retriever Daisy. He is very patriotic and finds it hard to come to terms with all the immigrants living around him. The boy who lives next door, Thao, is being pestered by his cousin, Spider to join his Hmong gang after they saved him from some Hispanics. Thao reluctantly agrees and his initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, his 1972 Gran Torino. He is discovered during the attempt, but gets away. A few days later the gang return and try to take Thao by force, but his sister, Sue tries to stop them and a fight breaks out. The fight spills onto Walt's property and he's suddenly there pointing a rifle at one of the gang members. They leave, but warn Walt to watch his back. Thao's family are traditional and they take him round to Walts house and tell him that Thao must work for him to make amends. Walt reluctantly takes him on and they eventually become friends as he gets Thao to mend the other houses in the street. You know that the gang are not far off, and sure enough they appear again and this time it's much more serious. It's now up to Walt to put things right. I won't say any more, I think that's enough spoilers for one day.A brilliantly measured performance from Clint Eastwood, he gave us the full range of his craft in this film. Everything from the brooding loner from the spaghetti westerns to the comic cowboy of Bronco Billy. So hats off to Clint Eastwood as Walt Kowalski for a most memorable performance. Also strong performances from Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor and Ahney Her as Sue Lor.A very well made film, again in the measured style that we've come to expect from Clint Eastwood (as director). A well thought out plot that kept me interested throughout and some really good performances. Over all, a very entertaining film telling a heart-warming story. Probably one of the best films I'll see this year and one I can highly recommend!My score: 8.8/10 0.22450549450549454\n",
      "In the hands of another director, this movie could have become sentimental, politically correct, preachy, and many other things. Such is not the case here, however. Eastwood tells a wonderful story without ever going over into movie-of-the-week sentimentality. He carefully balances the race issue so that no race is all good or all bad. He never allows his own character to become warm and fuzzy, even after he starts to warm back up. He never goes for the obvious; there the ending is a remarkable example. I never once looked at my watch; I became thoroughly involved with the characters, whom I felt that I came to know through time as real individuals and not just as easy caricatures. In short, this movie did everything that I want out of movie and never disappointed me.If you want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie that never goes to excess, never wastes time, and yet never seems to rush, this is the movie for you. 0.22651515151515153\n",

      "Clint is like a wine...older and better, richer in taste and potable to drink. Gran Torino is Grand Tornado of a movie, starting as a puff and finishing with tempest bolt. Film goes through fine line between comedy and drama, you laugh, smile, then you are afraid for main characters, you are laughing again and then you are struck with profound Shakespearian end. As real sculptor Clint models story into movie frame by frame, scene by scene, all down to last minute finale. You just feel joy by watching it. And it doesn't leave you after film is over. It just makes your day right. Hope to see more of this in future from Mr. Eastwood. And good luck in Oscars! 0.24540149393090568\n",
      "1. Contrary to Walt's simple-minded claim, blue-collar men are capable of the occasional sentence that doesn't use words like dick, ofay, guinea, and spook. Peppering dialog with racist insults wasn't insightful when Archie Bunker did it in the 1970s, and it isn't now.2. The hero is contrived. Over the course of one summer, Eastwood's Walt builds affection and the utmost loyalty toward the \"gooks\" next door, but he couldn't do the same with his own sons over decades? He's alternately soft- or hard-hearted depending on the needs of the plot.3. A few of the Hmongs have distinct characters, but Walt's family are little more than clichés-- resentful sons, greedy daughter-in-law, shallow granddaughter. His children are a disappointment to him and his ego, and he treats them as such. No wonder his sons are resentful.4. Further to that, the sons are presented negatively, as opportunists, but the only time Walt calls one of them is when he's in difficulty (and even then he doesn't have the courage to actually speak up), so is he really any better?5. The inexplicable stalking of mild-mannered Thao by his cousin's Hmong gang, in spite of the fact that \"all Hmong boys go to jail\"—so clearly there's no shortage of recruits. Presumably it's out of family loyalty? I don't think so, because...6. When the gang retaliates against Walt for having kicked the crap out of one of them, they open fire — on their own cousins' house instead of Walt's next door!7. The ending is entirely predictable, even before Walt starts getting all shaven and shorn for his coffin.8. Using the dog as a device to steal audience affection for Walt rather than making him someone genuinely likable and worthy of respect.9 etc. Bad lighting, sluggish direction, and, worst of all, transparent plot manipulation to keep the police out of the picture until the final scenes.

Eastwood plays a ex war veteran who's wife dies and he is left alone to cope with his Hmong neighbours. As racist and prejudiced as he is he comes to like and respect these people he used to kill in the war, and although he seems beyond his best in regards to his age he shows the Hmong gang bangers who is boss.

      "Not having seen any Eastwood films in my time (not even Dirty Harry!) I didn't know what to expect from the actor who'd built a reputation as portraying a hard-ass blowing away bad guys left right and center. I left the cinema feeling inspired and entertained at the same time. The characters, particularly Eastwood's (a hardened old war veteran with a distinct racist personality), are portrayed in such a believable, amazing manner I found myself comparing the standard of the acting to that of The Shawshank Redemption.Whilst Gran Torino is chock full of life-important messages, they aren't merely thrown into your face whilst being tacked onto a weak, filler plot. The story, a tale of redemption and Walt's reluctance to join a war of a much smaller scale, one in his own neighborhood, is both interesting and spectacular, whilst at the same time Walt's coy racial remarks will keep the audience entertained (though I'd not be surprised if this film were to cop a bit of flak regarding the racist remarks).After Shawshank Redemption and Forest Gump, this film has become a favorite of mine, and if it's Eastwood's last acting role, then he most definitely went out on a positively high note.

Especially based on personal preference, not the movie itself (acting, plot, etc.).Eastwood has never been a favorite of mine.. good at his job? Yeah, I guess. This is the movie that changed my opinion. The way everything is delivered in my humble opinion, and regardless of all the comments of the actors needing to find a new job(?!), is perfect. i wouldn't have changed much, if anything at all, because it makes everything more believable. There were faults. The lines weren't delivered perfectly. Big deal. With a plot like this it doesn't necessarily have to be \"Hollywood\" delivered. Real people don't always say things perfect, and I know if I was in that situation I sure as hell would have been awkward and trying to speak clearly. This was a touching plot overall, and so true to our society today. This is a good movie, and I say that as a disconnected third party observer putting my personal preference aside. A little slow in some parts, but still beautifully done.

I first watched this when i was 14, it was my first Clint Eastwood film. i would go even as far to see a showing of it in a cinema, it is such a highly philosophical film with characters like Walt(Clint Eastwood), Sue and Thao are very relatable which you can not help but get emotionally involved with. Walt is at the start of the film is a grumpy stubborn old man who keeps a stiff upper lip who does in no way want to get involved with his neighbours but eventually forms a relationship with a Hmong family next door, i'm not going to reveal any more because it's best to go in without knowing too much. This film is a 10/10 and their are not many films I would give that high of a score.

His type is dying out and we may all be the worse for it. The best line of the film is when the young Sue thanks him for being good to her brother and compares him to her traditional father. When Walt tells her that he's traditional too, she says, \" But you're an American.\" 'Being an American is unique. We have the freedom to speak freely whether we hurt feelings or not. That kind of language mutes hate and becomes bantering. Political correctness and multiculturalism is destroying what made this country great.

      "Gran Torino is a movie which there are lots of escalating situations which involves you into a kind of rivalry sense, or at least feeling like the scene Charges up, until it explodes and everything ends up destroyed. I think the title resembles more of the friendship with Thao with Walter rather than the actual rivalry between the gang and the \"family or group of Walter and the Hmongs\". Honestly the description of the Veteran doesn't correlate between the one that he starts with and the one he ends up with. In my opinion the movie is good, but not the best, it can be better because there are scenes that are predictable or either get a predictable ending which takes off the drama and action of the movie. The theme is not that original and the acting of some of the actors it's not that great in terms of expressions when coming to tense situations. Therefore I think that is a movie that deserves to be watched but not for the plot, rather for his racist jokes and sarcasm that is treated during the movie, not for the scalating useless scenes which charge you up in emotions to end up in nothing.!!! The racist part of the movie can be understood because as Walt is a war veteran is understandable but it may be found disturbing for many viewers or uncomfortable for Asian spectators.

      "First off, I have to say that I think I have been the youngest viewer to sit in every showing of Gran Torino. This disappoints me because I think that it is truly sad that a film like this cannot catch younger viewers who really need to witness a great film. However, I was never too surprised to see the absence of young audiences. After all, who wants to see a meaningful, touching film when there is My Bloody Valentine and Notorious. I digress.Although, I am an avid fan of Clint Eastwood, I judged this film unbiased. I know a bad film when I see one. This is Clint Eastwood's most defining moment as an actor. I have heard some viewers commenting this film as being unreal, but everything about this man (Walt Kowalski) is real. Clint Eastwood's character actually possesses flaws and reveals himself as an old man who, deep down, cannot challenge the entire gang. After all, Clint Eastwood actually dies.The whole ending is beautiful as he sacrificed himself like Jesus Christ. Now, I am not a religious person, but I could not help but see the comparison. Walt Kowalski finally was at peace by saying, \"No, I have a light.\" I can understand why viewers are uncomfortable with this film. I believe most of us are unsynthesized and can only hold out for an explosion or a car chase scene. As Gran Torino came to a close and the theme song started playing, no one moved. I looked all around me and I saw people transfixed by the screen. Every viewer was seated holding each others hands and drying their eyes. I was really touched. It almost made me have hope for man kind and gave me more admiration for what films are capable of.My one negative comment towards this film would not be the acting of Thao, but of the priest. I know that this character is young and naive, but does he have to be a bad actor as well? However, this does not affect my judgment of this film, because the overall message is far more important than a minor character.This film, by far, is a diamond in the rough for 2008 along with Changeling. Clint Eastwood as an actor and as a director has done so much more than most in his field and I wish people would recognize this. I think that Clint Eastwood has finally made a film that is perfectly mixed with all the elements that represent him (drama, humor, tension). I also have to comment on the cinematography, beautiful yet again.I really disagree with most of the negative comments posted on this site. In fact, I am always hesitant to posting comments on this sight because I do not feel that it is right to reach out and persuade another towards your viewing. However, after reading the negative comments I had to speak out. This film is definitely not a waste of your time or money. 0.1152220829852409\n",
      "Clint Eastwood is not of the Gary Oldman school of acting whereby we might be presented with a brilliantly studied portrayal of some diabolical villain or famous historical figure. Instead he gives us essentially the same character in more or less every film: a grizzled loner, troubled by wrongs he has seen and/or feels responsible for, with a sense of duty that impels him to some heroic act. Through his toughness and sardonic humour, Clint's misanthrope makes a comment on American society and its foundations in the fierce self-reliance and isolation of the early pioneers.Nor is he of the many of the schools of modern movie directing that seem nowadays to abound: the ultra-realistic, the fantastical, the futuristic, the sentimentally comedic.The films that have earned Clint greater critical appraisal have tended to focus on the silent sufferings of these troubled antiheroes, most notably perhaps in Unforgiven. However, many of the finer and more subtle merits of his work subsist in the stylistic elements worked out in many of the earlier, more superficially lightweight movies such as 'Play Misty For Me', 'Every Which Way But Loose' and 'Bronco Billy'.Take, for example, the soundtracks of these movies. All kinds of American ethnic music are to be found, serving not only to showcase Clint's eclectic taste, but, more importantly, to give a panoramic view of American 20th Century cultural history. And ethnic groups and their traditions are represented in abundance. There is to be found throughout an awareness of the defining element of America: its polyglot culture, its very resistance to definition.Moreover, Clint's movies stand or fall principally on scriptwriting, acting, directing and cinematography, without the need for gimmicky subject matter or excessive special effects. His craft is finely and patiently wrought through decades of experience, both in front of and behind the lens. There is no need to resort to overwrought emotional manipulation (Spielberg) or shock value (Tarantino). He can tell an interesting story with maturity and at a proper pace.Through decades of exposure Clint's trademarks (the sour-faced grunts; the angry grimaces when facing-off against the villains; the gravelly whisper; the tough-talking, gun-toting, righteous loner as protagonist; the godless wanderer who is nevertheless unable to reject the possibility of a greater good; the commonplace language and subject matter; the importance of physical strength and vigour; the cheerful but wistful soundtracks to which the closing credits invariably play out) have become elevated to the status of hallmarks of a genre. Clint has become an auteur in the Bergmanian sense, able to convey his message with increasing effectiveness through a refinement of his style.This film made me consider the extent to which Clint, as a movie icon, has been a staple figure at the heart of cinematic history for the last 50 years. Both his on-screen persona and his movie-making style have been with us, for better or for worse, all this time. Watching the closing credits of Gran Torino play out against the backdrop of a tree-lined American sea- front to a gently lyrical soundtrack of Jamie Cullum singing with piano accompaniment, I suddenly realised that this was might be something akin to a closing bulletin of Clint's message. The death of Walt Kowalski assumed a new poignancy. Perhaps it was not only he, but a very genre itself that was at an end.As a redress to detractors of Gran Torino I would invite them to examine the movie on its own terms, as an example of a genre. That genre is the Clint Eastwood movie. Rather than highlight weaknesses in the acting and the plausibility of the storyline, perhaps we should consider the movie's success in presenting a portrayal of Clint's movie persona and how, in dealing with the challenges facing him, he shows a fortitude we can only aspire to. Naturally, it would not do to go around threatening young Negro gang members with a pretend pistol in real life. But this is precisely the value of Clint's message. It is for us to be thoroughly entertained and satisfied by the way our hero faces down his foes, even though we could not and ought not do so for ourselves in our own lives. Clint's hero is not meant to be realistic, or an example of how to live. He is meant to be a movie character. In this sense, Clint's movies are pleasingly bereft of sanctimony, but full of moral value.It does not seem as though this movie represents the closing chapter of Clint Eastwood's movie making history and I for one would certainly not wish that history to come to an end anytime soon. However, like Sibelius' Seventh and last symphony, this film seems to bring the various threads and issues of its author's earlier work to a point where no further working out is necessary. 0.13207182345113377\n",
      "Gee,thanks Clint! After these endless exposes of crimes by sex maniacs among Catholic clergy and their lazy bishop enablers who moved them from parish to parish because they are loath to lose \"workers\" or simply out of \"old boy\" sympathies, it is a relief to see a film sympathetic to Catholics, even as we laymen are equally to blame for being equally lazy blind sheep.It is also refreshing to have Polish Americans depicted as good Catholics instead of the usual Fr. O'Malley (Bing Crosby) Irish types.It is hard to classify this film as that would be pigeon-holing it as a tragedy, a paean to heroism and therefore a triumph, or simply a good comedy. There are elements of all these. Eastwood made a courageous choice to pay no heed to political correctness as ethnic jokes came fast and funny in the film. The hard ribbing about some American perceptions of Asian diets were hilarious. Sample: Eastwood declining an Asian girl's invitation to a banquet: \"No thanks and keep your hands off my dog.\" \"We only eat cats,\" the girl retorted. In fairness, almost everybody gets hit - even white folks especially \"Micks\" and \"Pollacks.\" Blacks get it too although unspoken and almost subliminally as gangbang rap music is associated with street hoodlums.Most important, the main character, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is portrayed as a good Catholic although not what most people would picture in their minds: the rosary clutching, daily mass going, ascetic who goes about hands pressed together in perpetual pious devotion. Not that there is anything wrong with that but it's fun to see a crusty, beer-swilling, cussing contrary old man turn out to be a good person.Now for the hard moral questions: Kowalski goes to confession. He doesn't confess the fact that he beat up a Hmong toughie a few days earlier. Obviously, he didn't think that was a sin because he did it to stop the punk's gang from continuously hunting down Thao, the Hmong youth trying to straighten out his life. Educated armchair moralists may say \"the end does not justify the means\" but remember, Kowalski is just a retired auto line worker and part-time repairman. Still another seeming lapse of conscience: As he tried to dissuade Thao from embarking on mindless vengeance, he intimated that in the Korean War, he shot a young boy (soldier) who was probably scared and just trying to surrender. He didn't include that in his confession. No problem. His perception of that wartime incident is a recollection quite probably colored by post traumatic stress disorder, old age and failing health. In the heat of battle, he was just shooting at enemy soldiers as he was force-trained automatically to do. Kowalski must have known that was the case. That's why he saw no need to confess it. I believe Christ Himself would have directly told him \"Ego te absolvo...\"Here's the spoiler: John 15:13. That's exactly how the movie ended. 0.05922222222222222\n",

      "i don't use superlatives a lot and try not to hype movies in general, but that said i think Clint Eastwood in his old age has become the Da Vinci of American cinema. He is not making one bad movie and every movie is a study, a meditation and a lamentation on old age, violence, what it means to be an American and the overall notion of what is right and wrong and where an individual fits in that cosmology. He is to movies what McCarthy is to American literature.It started with unforgiven and continued with A Perfect World (a genius of a movie) and Million Dollar Baby and now this gem.For the sake of American art, I hope Eastwood lives to be 120. 0.025824175824175837\n",

I really don't know how else to describe it. There are however, a few critiques.Eastwood's character, while tough, seemed, I don't know, over the top. The growls he did I thought were a little weird.

      "It is amazing the comments written about this film, it is rather poor & at times unbelievable. Sometimes it looks like a gust of wind would blow clint over. He is just not convincing as this character. This film doesn't hang together very well. The ending isn't bad, but clint doesn't have the acting credentials to portray this character. I think a lot of clints fans are blind to its shortcomings. It is a rather poor film that certainly doesn't warrant anything near an 8 rating. I think as more & more non-clint fans see the film, its rating will drop. Clints spitting and character portrayal at times seems to be a parody of his previous roles in other films. Clints mumbling dialogue is painful at times. Come on clint you can & have done better than this. -0.05161064425770306\n",

      "If you've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie before, and if you're under 21 that's a lot of you....this is one of his best performances of all time.The storyline is, crotchety old Korean War vet Walter Kowalski (a tip of the hat to Killer Kowalski no doubt) is near death and has nothing to live for. The neighborhood he's lived in for years is now overrun with Koreans, and he being completely racist, can't stand it. One day he catches a kid named Tong trying to steal his prized 1972 Grand Torino and rather than blowing his head off..he takes him under his wing and tries to make a man out of him. Along the way he runs into just about every ethnic gang imaginable and talks down all of them...GOOD! I won't spoil the rest of the movie but lets just say, if more old men were like Eastwood's character, the world would be a much better place.The one liners in the movie had me laughing till 6 in the morning, one in particular was when Tong asks Walter what he wants to do and he says \"You see that tree outside? I want you to go in there and count the birds\" All in all its actually a very well done movie and even though the language is not suitable for the whole family, it does have a lot of life lessons throughout and should be a must watch for people of all ages.The highlight of the movie is when Eastwood calls one gang who's harassing Su, a bunch of \"spooks\" 8 out of 10 0.19021093285799173\n",
      "I love going to the movies, and I sometimes overate movies, just because I had so much fun seeing the movie, but that is not the case this time around.Gran Torino is just a great movie. Clint Eastwood Delivers...Again as A Director, a Producer, and especially as an actor. The movie is just very...very well done. It was shot in 76 days, and I wouldn't change anything about it for the world.The story is very basic. Walt Kowalski, a racist, Korean Veteran's wife has just died. He lives in a neighborhood populated by the Huang people from South Eastern Asia. He hates Asians from his Korean War days, so he despises all his neighbors. His children hate him, and just want him to die, so they can get his prize possession, his Gran Torino car. One night a gang pressures Kowalski's Asian next door neighbor, into trying to steal the Gran Torino. Kowalski gets really mad at the kid, but the gang tries to threaten his neighbors, and Kowalski saves them. The neighborhood thinks of Kowalski as a hero, and he begins to develop a relationship with his next door neighbors, which culminates into a very beautiful climax.The movie has excellent cinematography, and it is just a very conventional movie, everything is by the books. Eastwood is a masterful director who manages to create this gritty yet laid back feeling at the same time. The movie is very emotional, but at times, it can be extremely funny.Clint Eastwood gives the best performance of 2008 bar none. Better than Will Smith in Seven Pounds. Better than Ed Norton in Pride and Glory. Better than Sean Penn in Milk. Better than Frank Langella in Frost Nixon. Eastwood just portrays this bigoted, racist, hardcore, old school, Korean war veteran, widower in such a masterful way, that you really believe in your head that you've met a thousand of these kind of people, but somehow Eastwood's character separates himself from the others. Eastwood manages to be serious, yet very funny at the same time. One thing that I noticed in the movie is that only two sequences in the entire movie have music. The rest of the movie is just Eastwood's incredible performance keeping you glued to the screen. If there was ever an actor who deserved the Best Actor Academy Award...then it's Clint Eastwood. He's 78 years old, and regardless of his past performances, he has given us the best Performance of any actor for 2008.This is one of those movies that 10...20 years from now when you see the movie being played on TV you'll go...That was an amazing movie.

Many bad critics would say that this movie is a self-parody of Eastwood's life (he being 75) but that is just crap. Have no doubt that just as \"Million Dollar Baby\", \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" and \"Flags from our fathers\" Mr. Eastwood does a really good job, both as a director and an actor.

      "Do you wonder who I am? I can also tell you that I am a retired veteran who does not like people and only sweeps the snow in front of my house.I am swearing, cynical, and eccentric. I hate all the people around me, so I have few friends. I look down on this increasingly hypocritical world and I cannot forgive myself.I used a gun to intimidate the Miao gangsters: \"Killed you, I went home and slept like a baby.\" But after the war, I was often awakened by nightmares, and the corpses of the hands and things on the battlefield flashed from time to time.The two sons who drove the Japanese car were not close to me, and now my wife was gone. The only one who accompanied me was a medal and a classic car. By the way, I also kept a dog. They are all for the rest of my life.I thought my distressed year would be so dusty, but the newly moved neighbor gave me another way of living. After the US troops withdrew from Vietnam, many Miao people fled to the United States, and this family is one of them.The Miao girl, Su Neng, is very eloquent and speaks fluent English. I met her. She led me to visit her people, they are simple, clean and speak the mysterious Eastern language. When they saw me as a white man, they looked natural, polite and polite. Of course, they also have their own beliefs, which seems out of place with me as a Christian.Boy Tao showed inferiority. He was encouraged by the Miao tribe to steal my classic car. After the incident was revealed, I was punished by a volunteer to work for me, but I never thought that he and I would become good friends. I encouraged him to take the initiative in pursuing girls, for which I generously lent out the classic car that pulls the wind. I asked him to follow me to learn the dialogue between men and understand the balance between politeness and atmosphere. I told him which repair tools are necessary. Under my recommendation, he found his first job in life and became a modern worker.Someone said: \"Everyone will have a strange old man in his life. Only when you touch him will you find that he has so many stories.\"I trusted him, so I started telling Tao my story, from war, faith, family, to being a man, and even repairing household appliances. He is also willing to listen.Tao gradually became more confident, and at the same time, the assault of the bad guys became more reckless. Finally, after I warned one of the bigwigs, they swept the home of Tao and me with a machine gun, and Su was raped without a human face.\"It's time to end this battle.\" I think.On the day of the incident, I took care of my own affairs, smoking for the first time in the house, asking someone to shave me for the first time, wearing a suit for the first time ... I did something that I was \"shame\" thing.I even went to the 27-year-old virgin priest who was over-educated as a \"son\".\"Father bless me, I am guilty.

They looked at me ready to go, and I looked at them without fear.I insulted them, despised them, and pointed at them with gesture guns.I also ate the cigarette leisurely, and then reached out to touch the lighter in my chest, and they loaded it up cautiously.Suddenly, I quickly pulled my hand out and took out the \"gun\", but their gun was faster, dozens of bullets passed through my body, and I fell backwards and died.I pulled out the most beautiful gun in the world, but died under the most ugly gun in the world.I pulled out the gun in the most popular way of the era, but ended my life in the most ordinary way.If someone asks me now why I always see dissatisfaction in my eyes?

      "Gran Torino, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, might very well be the best film I've seen all year (either that or Slumdog Millionaire). It was truly an amazing and profoundly moving experience. The story is about a grumpy, foul-mouthed, and somewhat bigoted old Korean War vet in a rundown neighborhood who is at first resistant to the change he sees his community taken over by the Hmoung (ethnic group from Southeast Asia). In most films, the cinematography is designed to glamorize what's in front of the camera, but Clint's (or should I say Walt, his character's) neighborhood is starkly unpleasant to look at. It's one of those rundown industrial towns that has seen its glory days pass it by, just like Walt.The neighbors are threatened by gang violence and when Walt saves them from being harassed by pointing a gun at the gang, he becomes a reluctant hero. Not wanting any special attention, he refuses all the gifts, but he gradually softens up as his neighbors keep tugging away at his heartstrings and starts to mentor the two kids next door, Sue and Tao. The film is a sweeping look at faith (Clint's conversations with a priest are one of the high points of the film and serve as a thematic counterpoint to the action), shell shock, urban decay, culture clash, and especially ageism.Clint does battle and proves his worth to teenagers who are essentially writing him off because he's old. Maybe that's what every teenager does these days. This is the first picture I've seen to confront ageism so well. The film features Clint Eastwood's best performance. 0.22145124716553288\n",
      "Clint Eastwood growls and huffs and puffs through this oh too predictable-derivative of the old west-American fable. Grizzled white guy saves poor neighborhood immigrants from the neighborhood punks. Clint gets to reprise his Dirty Harry routine, with the difference that this time he's almost 80, a racist, and bitter. His character is embarrassingly open about his narrow mindedness, an openness that would last one New York minute used on Blacks or Hispanics, but seems to bounce off the Hmong neighbors, who are probably equally bigoted but have the manners to keep it to themselves.Clint reluctantly takes on the neighbor's son-who he had to drive out of his garage at gun point, after he tried to ineptly steal his Gran Torino-as a token of shame remuneration. In a week or so he's shaped him up from a diffident nerd into a more acceptable American: one who's willing to think about standing up for himself, and his family, against the neighborhood punks.He also befriends the boy's sister, after saving her, in an embarrassingly retro scene, from the stereotypical black guys behaving badly. She educates him, against his protestations, in the more civilized ways of her people.Unfortunately the screenplay relies on stilted, unrealistic dialog, almost as bad as if Dirty Harry had written it himself. The characters are one dimensional, and the relationships are drawn like a comic book.In the end, inevitably, Clint rides off to do battle, after the punks take revenge on his neighbors for his own attempt to exact justice. His method, however, is definitely Christ like, even though it also is self serving. Clint is dying of cancer.I've come to admire Eastwood's directorial work over the years, but from time to time he stumbles away from his simple, honest, style back into the artlessness of much of his earlier acting work. -0.026675849403122114\n",

A large family of Vietnamese refugees has moved in next door,loud,chaotic and close - knit,a complete contrast to his distant sons and their cold - eyed acquisitive offspring. Korean war vet Kowalski sees them with a jaundiced eye and rebuffs their attempts to befriend him. Under pressure from a street gang their youngest son tries to steal Kowalski's car and is nearly shot for his trouble.Slowly and grudgingly in an almost Fordian way,Kowalski teaches the boy to become a man. Nobody but Ford,you might think,could get away with such sentiment,but Mr Eastwood proves yet again that he has inherited the master's mantle. Influenced also by his mentor Mr D.Seigel's \"The Shootist\",Mr Eastwood has his main character commit suicide by gangbanger,redeeming himself and saving the neighbourhood at the same time. Half a century of guilt over an incident during the Korean War has turned Kowalski into a miserable misanthrope with a bad word for everybody.Whilst hardly Mary Poppins at the death,he has gone to his grave \"justified\",much as Mr R.Scott and Mr J.McRea in \"Ride the high country\". His total and joyful lack of 21st century political correctness has offended many but actions speak louder than words and a brave and brutally honest man chooses to end his life in a way that will benefit his Asian neighbours.Not,I submit,the act of an unregenerate nazi.

However, unlike in 'No Country', here the criminals do get caught. And this is an important difference. Walt is not a likable guy. He's very old fashioned and his racial views are disgusting at first. However, his was a 'harmless' racism. He does not want anything to do with his Chinese neighbors, and---as the ending shows---he's also no so trigger-happy either. Clint Eastwood is better here than in any of hid previous roles, and I am an Eastwood fan. He constructs a very believable character, a veteran who is disturbed by those who break the American values of \"live and let live.\" He dislikes his neighbors because of their un-American behavior, but then observes that they are all-right, and they only mean well. He sees it as his duty to defend the American values, which include helping the weak and getting justice done. Going back to the comparison, both movies have the subject of good fighting evil. In 'No Country' however, the ending is disappointing. Here, despite the fact that Walt is killed, his scheme served its purpose and the criminals are caught, which makes it both realistic and dramatic and more satisfying than 'No Country'. -0.005603535353535349\n",

      "Clint Eastwood returns to the screen with his second film of 2008 as a director (and his first acting role since \"Million Dollar Baby\" in 2004), following the Angelina Jolie vehicle \"Changeling\", and the result is one of the more interesting features in his filmography. Though the role of Walt Kowalski was apparently not written with Eastwood specifically in mind, it is almost impossible to think otherwise, as so much in the film depends upon the screen persona that Eastwood has painstakingly constructed in the minds of audiences over his several decades of screen stardom (drawing, in particular, upon the four films he did as Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan, the iconic vigilante cop). The marketing suggests that this is just another such vigilante story, pitting the now 78-year-old Eastwood against another gang of ethnic toughs for the safety of his neighbours (which probably set stereotype alarms off in many a viewer). However, what the trailer suggests is not much like what the film delivers.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a just-widowed retired Ford employee and Korean War veteran living in Highland Park, Michigan. The film opens with his wife's funeral, where he scowls at just about everyone: his two sons, their wives, and their children, especially the eldest granddaughter; and he insults the earnest but inexperienced young priest (Christopher Carney) who, at Walt's dead wife's urging, has committed himself to making Walt go to confession, which the old man has no intention of doing. Walt is just about the last white person living in his old neighbourhood, otherwise populated now by Hmong immigrants. Walt is racist almost to the point of caricature (the film takes refuge in audacity; he's so virulent in his insults that it becomes a genuinely uproarious point of humour with the audience), but he's generally misanthropic, and would rather just be left alone with his dog, Daisy, and his beloved car, the titular 1972 Gran Torino. It is the car, however, that leads to him being dragged into the lives of his neighbours, the Lor family. Thao (Bee Vang) is a fatherless young man without direction in life, who, over the objections of his sister Sue (Ahney Her), finds himself drawn towards his cousin's gang. The price of initiation is the theft of Walt's Gran Torino, which he fails at; the gang attempts to drag him away, but Walt, not knowing Thao was his attempted carjacker, intervenes (\"Get off my lawn.\"), and inadvertently becomes a hero to the neighbourhood, to his annoyance.Resocializing Walt becomes the project of Sue, the independent-minded and Americanized daughter, who is heedless of Walt's constant insults (firing some of her own back at him, which seems to earn her his respect). In particular, Sue hopes that her brother can find a male role model and some idea of what he wants to do in life. Meanwhile, the gang lurks on the periphery.This sounds like an extremely cliché and sentimental story of a white guy learning a Valuable Lesson about race, mixed with a standard Clint Eastwood vigilante drama about taking the fight to the local punks, but it is neither. On the former score, Eastwood's style of storytelling (and his presence in the story itself) is relentless in avoiding sentimentality; there is a strongly realistic feeling to the proceedings. There is, however, an unexpectedly high quotient of humour; the middle section of the film is frequently hilarious, making a strong case for Eastwood as the ultimate straight man in a buddy comedy (though he is also the source of most of the humour, a mix of \"fish out of water\" and audacious \"I can't believe they went there\" use of racial slurs). On the second count, the story Eastwood is telling here is actually a thorough deconstruction of the \"Dirty Harry\" persona that he has cultivated over the years, similar to his \"Unforgiven\" as a take on his old Western roles. Much of Walt's mentoring of Thao concerns views of masculinity, and the ultimate result is something audiences probably won't expect. This story wasn't expressly written with Eastwood in mind, but it's hard to imagine anyone else essaying the part, which ends up drawing so much from audience recognition of Eastwood's own history. One would never have imagined Clint Eastwood as a herald of a new, multicultural America, but that is the image this film presents us with, as the Hmong are the new defenders of traditional American family values, while Walt's family are incredibly shallow (a minor knock against the film, I think; they're so cartoonishly unworthy as to not be very believable), and there's an hysterical attack on the only other young white character as a weak imitator of blacks (or, more specifically, urban gangster/thug culture) (which the blacks don't take kindly to either; African-Americans and Latinos are tangential here, with gangs of each appearing briefly, but the focus is mainly on whites and Asians).On the acting front, Eastwood turns in another award-worthy performance; whether or not he gets an Oscar nomination, I would count him deserving of one. Eastwood also, per another recent trend, helps score the film, and actually warbles a few bars of the theme song, \"Gran Torino\", which must be heard to be believed. The primary debate among reviewers of this film seems to be about whether the first-time Hmong actors that Eastwood has cast are great, awful, or something in between. Of the two main Hmong actors, Ahney Her as Sue I found to be extremely compelling; Sue is, after Walt, the film's best-realized character, and one minor issue I had with the film is how she sort of fades from view as the focus shifts to Thao. Vang as Thao is less polished than Sue, and some scenes stretch the limits of his range, but it is a credible debut.All in all, this is one of the year's best films, and I would highly recommend it. 0.07705163883735314\n",
      "Gran Torino is another brilliant masterpiece by the veteran actor/director Clint Eastwood. I must admit that the movie had all the trademarks of a Clint Eastwood film, although within a different context. It's a movie about courage, integrity and bravery. Eastwood's familiar never-say-die attitude mingled with his stubborn fighting spirit portrayed a superbly round character of Mr. Kowalski, which none but Eastwood could depict with such perfection. The film is apparently characterized by evident elements of masculinity that we all expect from Eastwood's films. Fast action, manual labor, construction works, tools, gangs, guns and of course that old hard car Gran Torino that resiliently survived countless violent storms of time. Clint Eastwood's typical action styles were fabulous and it's good to see that even after so many years these trademark styles still entertain the audience. Eastwood's direction is praiseworthy because he has successfully been able to infuse his old styles and spirits into a fresh context, which has made it more appealing to a new set of audience. 0.19242424242424244\n",
      "This is another movie where we see the lighter side of Eastwood. You wouldn't think so at first glance as his character is portrayed as a hard curmudgeon who's angry at everyone and himself.Your initial thoughts probably are, why is he so angry? He hates his adult children, he hates their wives, he hates the grand children, he hates import cars and he especially hates his Asian neighbors.As the story progresses, Eastwood gets to know the neighbors and even makes a statement that goes something along the lines of \"I have more in common with them than my family.\"Life, love, exploration, death, it's all in the story.You see Eastwood go from a crotchety old man without purpose to a crotchety old man with a purpose. Yes, I realize that's says very little but you have to see the movie to understand what I mean. His character doesn't really soften by movie's end but he changes himself and those around him for the better.The story dragged at times but that was probably due to my expectations from the previews and trailers. I went in with the mindset of \"Charles Bronson, vigilante action\" for which the story was not. Yes there are guns, shootings and violence but they are not a major part of the movie.Some may be offended by the stereo-typical portrayal of some races.

      "This is what I needed to start off my 2009 movie experience. Gran Torino is everything you've come to expect from a Clint Eastwood movie. It has a good plot, a decent cast. The only complaint I have is the sound, from time to time, the scenes offer different background noises. Hard to explain, easy to notice. It's more so in the beginning of the film. I feel bad even having that complaint about the movie, that's how good it was. This is 2009's Dirty Harry. I don't want to spoil anything about the movie, but I do have to say, when you go to see this movie, think Dirty Harry with a 1911. Don't read any further than this for a review, because any details may ruin some of the epic scenes.

All the actors, and yes, I'm surprised to say, that includes Mr. Eastwood, over-acted their parts. It got to be annoying to say the least. As Eastwood's character changes, it does get easier to watch, but constant poor performances from his co-stars (except Ahney Her) reduce the enjoyability of the film.My fault is probably that I expected it to live up to its rating. A strong 6/10, far from a masterpiece. -0.07535353535353537\n",
      "In Gran Torino, Eastwood's Character, Walt Kowalski, seems to be the embodied repudiation of virtually Eastwood's entire career. Much as Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) and Flags of Our Fathers (2006) examined the impact and aftermath of war and violence from a directorial perspective, Eastwood uses his peerless acting chops in Gran Torino to examine the gunslinger approach to problem-solving  and finds it lacking.Politically, Eastwood is difficult to get a handle on. His Wikipendia entry states that Eastwood has been registered as a Republican since 1951, supported Richard Nixon in 1968 and John McCain in 2008, and was adamantly pro-business as the (largely undistinguished) mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in the 1980s.On the other hand, commissioner Eastwood along with Chairman Bobby Shriver (Ah-nold Schwarzenegger's brother-in-law) were instrumental in leading the California State Park and Recreation Commission in its unanimous opposition to a six-lane toll road that would have cut through San Onofre State Beach north of San Diego. Eastwood and Shriver also supported a 2006 lawsuit to block the toll road and urged the California Coastal Commission to reject the project. Given the heavy-handed tactics of the toll road proponents, it isn't hard to believe that these actions led directly to Eastwood and Shriver not being reappointed to the park commission.What this seems to leave us is an artist who has evolved remarkably through the years. Defying Churchill's oft-quoted alleged witticism about old Liberals having no brain, Eastwood seems to have examined the butcher's bill left by his earlier work  and decided that blazing through life with guns drawn just might not be the best way to conduct one's life. 0.0965079365079365\n",

      "I admire Clint Eastwood on many levels that are all on show in his latest work 'Gran Torino.' I admire firstly his acting which isn't a lot of growling but is the exterior of a bitter, old man who is a Korea war veteran and recent widower. There is much pain and guilt that isn't put out on display in the likes of actors desperate to win awards but subtly that is both humane, beautiful and believable. As a director I admire him most for his simplistic brilliance at storytelling. He occasionally experiments like with one averagely filmed montage in the middle of the film but i'm sure he can improve it. He doesn't call for mystery, the one time he did was the average but overrated 'Mystic River,' and as you watch his films you are immersed in the heartfelt stories he brings to audiences. With every film he directs an audience can feel his heart in the story. I also admire him as a film composer and song-writer along with his musically gifted son Kyle Eastwood. The song at the end, apart from the fact that he sung a little bit (sorry Clint your not that talented), is truly heartfelt and placed perfectly. If I had any problem it would be with the young Asian lead. I admire Clint Eastwood as a director for casting people who had never acted before in these roles but when he acted alongside in some scenes, he pales in comparison and sadly takes something away from some of the scenes. I also thought the ending was 'good.' I admire Eastwood for what he was trying to achieve with that ending and he succeeds on all levels but I think the films ending lacked the complete emotional knock-out that Million Dollar Baby did and while this films ending hits you in the chest somewhere near our dusty hearts that film hits you square in the gut. 0.13997747747747744\n",
      "Where to start on Gran Torino, this is probably one the best movies I've seen of 2008.This is one of the few movies that I like in which the main character carries to near greatness. Clint Eastwoods mere presence in any movie signifies its superiority as far as quality acting and directing. It was all \"Kowalski\" in this fine film. He plays his white American bigotry role and hits hit the nail on the head. He is naturally a bit conservative in his tough guy roles but in his portrayal as \"Kowalski\", he pushes it to near controversy. (He does tend to hold back on certain dialog for politically correct reasons). But what Clint Eastwoods biggest strength is that he displays a sense of self conflict throughout his story. He shows a psychological deep and rich emotional character that everyone will love.He emanates toughness and intimidation without ever firing a bullet in Gran Torino, and it came from practice when he was Dirty Harry and when he was in all those Tough Guy westerns. He shows a warm but tough fatherly/grandfatherly persona towards his Hmong neighbors with strict sense of morals and impenetrable pride. Under his direction, Clint Eastwood does his best to make his supporting cast shine with decent performances, though it is hard to outshine the master. Even in the end, after his demise, he ensured the spirit of Kowalski lived on. Not many characters in any movie can actually do that.I am not ashamed to jump on the bandwagon and say that this is a great movie. I recommend it. One of the best movies of the year. 0.1056547619047619\n",
      "The acting in this movie is terrible pretty much across-the-board, except for Eastwood, Walt, but even his performance seems phoned-in and phony, probably owing to the poor script.I honestly don't know how many of these scenes and performances (travesties) were acceptable for Eastwood and his team, maybe they gave up after X amount of takes and thought that it was too late to recast. The scene when Walt locks the boy in the basement and he has a total flip-out would have to be one of the funniest spectacles I've ever seen. Eastwood is the saving grace of this movie, and only just manages to hold it together. I won't lie, I won't poo-poo all over it, as it is kind of moving in some ways, and some of the jokes do have a little pizzazz to them.I know its traditional to automatically give all of Eastwood's movies a high rating because it's him, a legend, but this movie doesn't wow me. I would call it an average movie with, I guess, a \"good message\". 0.05720588235294116\n",
      "Judging from the high ratings this movie gets on IMDb, you would expect it to be great. Or at the least a bit entertaining and well thought out. Gran Torino is none of the above. It is incredibly cheesy, poorly acted (Clint does deliver, all the other actors unfortunately do not) and quite patronizing in its 'teaching' of morals.This is probably the biggest problem with the movie: many scenes are devoted to showing how Clint comes to appreciate his Korean neighbors and how Tao learns 'hard working values', but the movie shows it in such a completely expected manner that I could have predicted the end (won't spoil) after the first half hour. The thing is: I get it OK? Old grumpy man appreciates Korean culture after having fought in (ohw what a surprise) the Korean War. Just please don't take two hours of god-awful scenes to tell this. And on top of that, don't keep spelling out the meaning of every individual scene or event that takes place; I GET IT!I am willing to put all the bad acting (mainly the Korean actors) aside, but the patronizing messages that are explicitly iterated over and over again left me wanting to hurl. 0.058055555555555576\n",

His performance is non-stop exhilarating, brutal, yet with a heavy heart that's endured plenty. Bee Vang was extraordinary throughout with an unbelievable break-out performance, as well as Ahney Her.

      "It's not a Dirty Harry film... really, it isn't. But someone forgot to tell Clint Eastwood.Clint Eastwood carries around so much Legend with him that no matter how he approaches a character, we view him through the prism of his inimitable Avenger archetypes. He was Dirty Harry in only five of his nearly 60 starring films, yet when Clint goes Avenger, he'll always be Harry Callahan to us.Foul-mouthed Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an outspoken racist who demeans religion, estranges himself from his children and grandchildren, mocks foreign families, and pulls a shotgun on a boy who tries to steal his car. Only Clint could play this 78 year old, unrepentant Korean War vet and still be loved for it. No one else could have pulled it off - after all, a man's got to know his limitations.Recently widowed Kowalski is the last white man standing in a Detroit neighborhood overrun by Hmong immigrant families from Southeast Asia and Vietnam. He is none too happy with his social situation - in fact, he acts the hell out of the Actor's Workshop definitions of Cantankerous and Surly - and keeps busy by obsessively mowing his lawn and fawning over his prized 1972 Gran Torino.A local gang forces Kowalski's young neighbor, Thao (Bee Vang), to \"mess with another man's vehicles\" and steal the Gran Torino as initiation, but Thao comes up against Kowalski's aforementioned shotgun and flees. The next night when the gang returns for the unwilling Thao, a scuffle breaks out and ends up on Kowalski's well-tended lawn.There can be nothing more foreboding, and yet so hysterically funny, than Clint Eastwood aiming a shotgun at a gangbanger's head and bringing his velvet rasp to bear on that age-old phrase of grumpy old men: \"Get off my lawn!\" That is the moment Walt/Clint/Philo becomes Dirty Harry. And for once, we cheer the grumpy old man.That's why no one else could have played this role. When someone offends a character played by Clint, we EXPECT Clint to pull a gun. Anything less would detract from his Avenger awesomeness. Now if Woody Allen played Kowalski, we'd have a more believable \"Everyman pushed to the edge.\" Clint is hardly Everyman. And you don't have to push him to the edge to get a gun in your face - the middle will do. That's what keeps Clint Harry.While the Hmong neighborhood showers Kowalski with gifts for his \"heroism,\" the gang harbors a vendetta against Thao's family, which only escalates. Meanwhile, Thao offers his services to Kowalski to atone for his attempted theft; thus even as events concatenate to bring out the Callahan in Kowalski, his paternal side is awakened as he mentors Thao.Clint's performance, though not Oscar-worthy, is vintage Clint, all sneering one-liners and avenger glares, recognizing his own star quality and humor and playing to those strengths. The cast of unknowns supporting him is another matter. Most of the Asians cannot act and seem like props for the story to progress. In his first film role, Bee Vang does such a useless job as Thao that we're constantly wondering whether he's acting socially inept or whether his acting is inept. When you \"fall out\" of the film to wonder - Game Over.A young Catholic priest (Christopher Carley) serves as an annoying \"conscience\" for Kowalski; he consoled Kowalski's wife in her last days and pesters Kowalski to take confession. Kowalski tells him straight: \"I think you're an overeducated 27 year old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.\"We love you too, Harry.As violence in the neighborhood escalates, the specter of Harry rises to meet it: \"Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.\"This man has tongue-kissed Death, garnering war medals he has no use - and even less respect - for; we feel his visceral absence of fear against tiresome street punks who think they are tough because their pants are low. Eastwood shows us it has nothing to do with height of pants, as his are up somewhere near his armpits.The pants are a dead giveaway - we realize with a sudden impact this man is a \"grandpa.\" It takes a bit of getting used to hearing his actual grandkids say it, rather than a bad guy mocking him before getting the subsequent knuckle sandwich or magnum opus.So we feel the inevitable coming: Screenwriter Protocol decrees the Curmudgeon must soften and the Patsy must harden (i.e. racist Kowalski learns tolerance and wimpy Thao learns manliness - they \"complete\" each other) - but it doesn't come! Taking their cue from that rubber bracelet, \"What Would Harry Do?\" director Eastwood and writers Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson allow Kowalski to become a hero without becoming insufferably pc.Yet another Eastwood film that defines \"heroism\" clearly: A hero is someone who has the option NOT to be.Killing boy-soldiers in Korea still haunts Kowalski, so to save Thao's and Sue's lives and to redeem his own, Kowalski's fearless, fading warrior goes out with a bang - literally.We can see the showdown looming, but because it's Clint, we don't quite accept what is happening until it happens. What Would Harry Do? At his age... in the 'burbs... Harry just might...In LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, I called Bruce Willis the screen's Last Action Hero. I was wrong. There's always gonna be some Dirty left in our Harry. 0.026671749967204526\n",

But thats it.This movie is another in a long line of Clint Eastwood directed/acted movies where it is just another opportunity to further Eastwood's narcissism. I don't have a problem with redemption stories or flawed main characters, but its the fact that his movies are always about Eastwood. This is why a director who is acting in his own movies is no good. Its just no good at all.I thought back to the other Eastwood movies. Million Dollar Baby is about Eastwood as the trainer, not the boxer. This movie is about an old war vet, not the community he lives in. On surface you would probably tell me that this is fine, but I think its very degrading. Eastwood had a family's house shot up, a young girl raped, another burned with a cigarette and almost killed JUST so he could go out and save the day. Million Dollar Baby is the same way where the movie is about the decision of a trainer, not the heartbreaking story of the boxer.Now, a one off isn't bad. Even a two off. But every movie that Eastwood acts/directs, you end up with everyone falling into the background while Eastwood's ugly mug comes to the foreground.Now I completely understand why the acting community loves him. Not only is he an actor turned director, but he has developed a manner to take an actor's ego to a new level. With this backing, the public supports him no matter what.

He is a true legend in the movie business. This tale presents Eastwood as a crusty, bigoted Korean War veteran whose weathered face hints at a world of horrors he has visited. He grudgingly befriends a Hmong family next door, taking an interest in them after his beloved wife dies. He has no warm fuzzies for most people - even his own family - but slowly develops a deep respect for this immigrant clan, realizing after several incidents in the neighborhood that they embody some of the human traits he holds dear: honor, justice and loyalty. \"Gran Torino\" is one of the best movies of 2008 and it's a travesty that it didn't even get a single Oscar nomination.

So in that sense, the movie works, it has a lot of good characteristics.But classic? I'm just not there yet. It's missing something.

Throughout, there are a lot of very interesting moments, that can either be related to, or indeed, are very human, and again build your relationship with the characters, to a level where you feel real emotions for them, their victories, and their hardships.Also, the acting is great, and Clint Eastwood really pulls off an excellent performance the whole way through.Not wanting to spoil it, the ending is very, very good.I cant imagine anyone not liking this film, and anyone who does most is most likely the sort of person who goes to see \"disaster movie\" twice in the cinema, and buys it on DVD. 0.2801851851851852\n",
      "Wow..This drama is now on my top list. This movie provided a a perfect amount of humor, action, and tear jerking moments to make it a must see film. From beginning to end there is no boring unnecessary non dramatic moments, every moment takes you to the mind set of the character. This character portrays a older war veteran, that is rude and racist yet hilarious and lovable and showing you the human side to his emotions beyond the cold old man he has become. Clint Eastwood directed and played a memorable role, and showing his skilled talents once again. This dramatic film deserved way more attention than it got, and a standing O.

      "I gave this movie a 6... basically it's a pretty good movie, i mean i was entertained for 2 hours and the story is interesting, however there is no major suspense, I personally thought that the dialogues were very cheap, the acting was nooot good at all, apart from Eastwood and maybe the Hmong girl, Sue, and the characters themselves were developed too quickly.. basically from the trailer you knew its the story of a grumpy old man who becomes less grumpy throughout the movie, (i don't believe it's a spoiler since it's in the trailer and it doesn't reveal anything about the plot); anyways the change in Clint's character is badly done, i mean i'm usually a fan of Eastwood's directing work but this is no Kubrick, i'm sorry.. 8,4??? really??? come on. This movie is a 6,3 tops. but entertaining, worth watching. better watch blood in blood out though, not the same concept, but way more entertaining. Ciao ;) 0.1472166666666667\n",
      "Clint Eastwood is an absolute Hollywood icon, there is no question about the fact that he has made some movies that are timeless. However, the emphasis lies on 'has'.In everything Eastwood has recently made, he keeps on reaching back to his glory years in the Western genre. As a result, all his recent films have the vices of a Western. You have the über-heroic, one-liner spitting main character, the paperboard psyches of the characters, the predictable plot, the pathos, the grande finale ending (with katharsis of course!),... But while those things are fun, appropriate and even essential in the Western genre, they are totally out of place in every other serious genre.Because what Eastwood produces this way is a dragon of a movie that is not only unrealistic and unoriginal but also irritating and childish.The tale of the grumpy loner who is at war with the whole world, but who, trough the friendship with an outsider, comes to see how he was wrong, is as old as the movie industry and only reserved for Disney films these days. The characters (but especially Eastwood's)are black and white caricatures and their psychological development is ridiculously unsubtle. The actors themselves don't help either. The Asian actors act like in a school play and Eastwood seems to have been too lazy to do any other character than in his last 20 movies. Above the constant annoyance of the incredibility come the, in this context, laughable cowboy-like one-liners and the bad dialogues. The over the top, pathetic (as in PATHOS) ending was thus perfect for this B-movie.It irritates and baffles me that this movie gets such positive reactions and I hope that Eastwood stops making films and destroying my image of him. -0.056890331890331894\n",
      "copied and pasted from google. I just want to vote not waffle,whats the point For weeks, as the road to Oscars' Feb. 22 ceremony in Hollywood has laid out in front of award watchers, critics and industry groups have continually turned their heads as \"Gran Torino\" drove by  no Golden Globes or Broadcast Critics Choice awards, no nominations by producers, directors, actors or writers guilds. You could see the roadkill on the highway.Yet, Eastwood is a favorite of the Motion Picture Academy voters. He has won two best director and best film awards (\"Unforgiven\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\"), but never won for acting. He was the star of \"Gran Torino,\" and the movie and his performance have earned mostly good reviews. Moreover, the film has been a hit with moviegoers who vote with their dollars at box offices ($78 million and climbing). As a result, many award watchers believed Academy voters would make Clint's day. But they didn't. And the question is, did they get it right or wrong? 0.3706349206349206\n",

I loved the way that every shot of the film was framed and just the technique behind the film. Also the story is very solid, the cinematography is done well and the acting is superb. Clint belongs with the legends of cinema actors like Paul Newman, John Wayne, Marlon Brando and there are so many more I could mention, but even if this is the last Clint performance I know that the legend will live on in all of his wonderful films. 0.1525974025974026\n",

It stays out to neighbors and friends more than any other movie that I have!

      "A film which gives you laughters and tears - a film about prejudice but ultimately acceptance and even more, Gran Torino is a heart-warming drama presenting in a natural way.I must admit before I saw the film, I didn't expect too much as the plot seems to be simple and predictable. Also, watching a grumpy old vet being racist to his neighbours didn't seem to be very pleasant. However, when the film went on, I found this character Walt Kowalski was actually quite likable. Clint Eastwood's great acting has given a soul to the character. Gradually he made the audience accepted this character the same way the character accepted his neighbours.What I found most striking in this film is that Walt Kowalski didn't even just accept his new friends, he was prepared to give up his life and his most valuable Gran Torino as well. Maybe some outsiders would think this is stupid. However, to Walt Kowalski, he would rather die in an honourable way. This film exposes some issues which facing old people and in the end, it made us feel that life and death is not really such a big deal, and that there is really no difference between your son and a complete stranger.

Don't pass it up! The newcomers in the movie acted with utter professionalism. And Clint delivered an Unforgiven for the modern age. I have to admit that though the Gran Torino has a part in the movie, I might have titled it something different. But it's Clint Eastwood. He could have called the movie \"Walt,\" or \"Wally,\" in deference to his character's name, and it would be the same: brilliant. My giant of a father and tough, biker brother-in-law were both overcome with emotion watching this movie. You will be, too. 0.18611111111111112\n",
      "The film gets praise for at least having a social consciousness and deftly weaving that into an emotional, funny, human film. Not many actors could have pulled this off but Clint has no problem carrying the film.The Kowalski character is a little bit of a cartoon amalgamation of every negative grumpy old bitter white man stereotype. Its hard to believe if he was really that bitter and racist that he wouldn't be anywhere but oiling his rifle behind the locked door of his bedroom in the dark. But the fact that Clint is the force behind this character makes you really not care about this, its Clint freaking Eastwood everyone loves him. So the audience immediately identifies with the snarly, racist character. Perhaps more than they should.The acting of the Hmong actors is passable, the female lead acts quite well. The male lead's (over)acting will have you wincing at several points in the film. Though its not enough to spoil the movie in any appreachable way.Its hard to fault the plot it feels authentic, the dialouge is human, and the scenes have an air of reality.The only thing that bugs me about the film is the 'movie of the week' casualness way that the gang members are defined. The movie's explanation is that they don't feel they fit in with society, are scared of white society, so they become these violent gang members. That maybe true for a certain % of gang members but its certainly not the case for many of them. This explanation seems like its out of the 1950's.The truth is many of these kids grow up in poverty, violence, abuse. Many of them are emotionally disturbed, reenacting the violence and abuse perpetrated on them as children, many of them are mentally ill living in a waking nightmare. Acting like a wounded animal refusing to show their shattered psyche's covering it with a tough guy exterior. Note that this is not an excuse for violence. However if you want to try and fix the problems you have to understand the root that grows violence. Its not mild social anxiety as Clint Eastwood asserts in this film.The story in the black and white world Eastwood has created isn't without merit but its severely lacking and in this lack glosses over poverty, abuse, and broken lives.As entertainment the film is top notch, and maybe its message will reach some kids. I certainly hope so, but its a bit of a joke to view this film as an accurate sociological study of poverty and violence. I hate to say it but its a typical out of touch white guy view of gangs and poverty. Well by God if you just get a job all your problems will go away. It reaches the depth of movie of the week in this area. In missing the mark on this issue so widely the film does lose some of its authenticity. However its difficult to outright condemn the film as it has good intentions and delivers an entertaining experience. 0.004639550264550261\n",
      "If you combined the very worst qualities of Archie Bunker and Al Bundy, he still would be a better person than Walt Kowalsky.That is how I feel about Clint Eastward's character in Gran Torino.Clint portrays a bigot without one real likable characteristic.If this were a comedy like 'All In The Family' or 'Married With Children', I could have at least had a few laughs. GRAN TORINO purports to be a serious drama.What this film has is about every cliché imaginable.including this one.SPOILER ALERTIn the tradition of older Warner Bothers films where the star dies a a martyr's death,he is spread out on the lawn as if crucified.This however is not the ending one,more clichés follow & many before.Scenes in this movie have been done so many times over the years,it almost is a comedy.Clint does his usual fine direction in the awful script. The acting by mostly actors from Television or in debut performances are all what you expect. The production credits are good as well.Bee Vang is quite good in his first role as the put upon teen ager. Christopher Corley in his first major film role is the kindly likable priest, Combine Pat O'Brien & Bing Crosby priestly roles. He is the only really likable character besides Bee's Thao.There are nasty villains. we have seen them too many times by now.Now one more thing, Whats the deal with this auto. I never was able to figure out peoples desires and love for cars. Yes, when I drove I liked & took good care of my cars, They were expensive even then so you were supposed to take good care of them.BIG DEAL.In closing, I now can see why this movie was so overlooked during award season, It deserved NONE.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 64 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10) 0.1806818181818182\n",

There are a lot of F bombs dropped in this one, beware of that, but as bad as it is to say this, the movie would not be as funny without them. The scene where he just beats that fat gangster to a pulp is good stuff. Little punk deserved it. If you want a good, entertaining movie, I am sure you will love this one. It is for sure original. It does not copy other movies, it is its own and that is why I think I enjoyed it so much. It made me laugh and yet be intense at the same time, it did that for my wife also, but made her cry to.

The only thing worse than killing a person, is getting a medal for it.\" I couldn't agree more. Then he goes to the house without a gun and allows himself to be gunned down in public, so the boys would go to prison for murder.This movie deals with hard issues like Racism, Rape, War, Death, Loss & Sacrifice.

      "Clint Eastwood's 2008 film \"Gran Torino\" is a movie that shows the transition of old tradition into modern society and its problems. Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired Korean War vet who is bitter, even to his own family. Day after day Walt sits on his porch, yelling racial slurs at his Asian neighbors. Walt develops an accidental friendship with one of the neighbors. He was the young teenage Hmong boy who tried to steal his car. Thao (Bee Vang) was sent by his cousin to steal Walt's car, so that Thao would be accepted by them.Thao repays Walt back for his mistakes by doing chores. During this time, they slowly develop a friendship and Walt becomes more open with the young boy. Meantime, Walt is having problems with a severe cough that usually results in a handkerchief of blood which he tries to conceal.One day Sue, Thao's sister, was attacked by their cousin. She was brutally beat and this sets Walt over the edge. During the time that Thao was doing chores, they developed a friendship for one another. Walt set out that night, after locking Thao in his basement, looking for the Asian Gangbangers. He finds them at their house and he yells at them from the outside. The Hmong gangsters open their windows with guns pointed. Walt reaches into his pocket and the gangsters shoot him. Walt falls to the ground with a lighter in hand; ready to spark up another cigarette. Thao now became the owner of Walt's Gran Torino.What I found ironic was that in the beginning of the movie Walt was always cursing at them to get off his lawn and yelling racial slurs, and in the end Walt gave his life to send the shooters, the Hmong gangsters, to prison for a long time. This movie showed that strangers may be closer than actual family in the end. 0.01847826086956523\n",

      "I've said it many times, but now I risk putting it in writing: Clint Eastwood has been playing the same character for more than 40 years. He's not the best actor, but he's simply marvelous at picking movies where his lack of depth works. Unforgiven was divine, Million Dollar Baby was a masterpiece, but I'm still trying to make up my mind about Gran Torino. I spent much of the film appalled by the wooden acting of everyone (except Sue and Thao's very animated mother and grandmother, a couple of the gang members, and the black kids during one brief interlude), but the end made me forgive almost everything.The movie was a great lesson in tolerance, understanding, forgiveness and the power of redemption. I thought some of it was ridiculous (such as the over-the-top insults between Mr. Eastwood's character, his barber, and his friend the builder), but all in all it progressed well and satisfied. I'll say again that the acting was pretty dreadful overall, and I'll repeat that the end made it worth watching. I could have been spared the reading of the will at the very end, and (*cringe*) Clint Eastwood singing over the closing credits was just wrong.The plot was good, but the acting took a great deal away from it for me. Sorry. I know this was a well-received film, but I think some acting lessons for just about everyone would have prompted me to give it a higher rating. Watch it anyway. There's still much to redeem it. Thanks for reading. 0.13484848484848486\n",

(Korean boy tries to steal car, gets taken under racist ex-war heroes wing and gets car in the end.) I could have told you that was going to happen after the first 10 minutes.Also, the way that the characters interact with each other is just laughable.

      "We meet Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a racist Korean War veteran, living in the suburbs of Detroit, at his wife's funeral. We discover that he is a cranky and grizzled senior, with contempt for his own selfish family, including his sons and their spoilt children. Living next door to Walt is an Asian-American family, including most significantly a young boy named Thao (Bee Vang), who is being harassed by his street gang cousins. The gang attempts to initiate Thao by trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino car from his garage. Walt catches Thao and holds him in great contempt. Yet when he saves Thao's life from the gang one evening he is thanked by the family next door and welcomed into their home.Gran Torino represents Clint Eastwood's best efforts to shift between humour and drama with emotional punch, as few other directors would attempt. While many assumed that Gran Torino was a pseudo-sequel to the Dirty Harry films, Clint Eastwood has again distanced himself significantly from his iconic character. Both Harry Callaghan and Walt are collectively enforcers and all round tough guys, but this is largely where the similarities end. Rather, Walt - as war veteran and a patriot - remains a contrast to the way in which society has degraded its morals and its values. He is tired and angry with youths – like his grandchildren - are rude and uncaring. Even Walt's own children remain grovelling, selfish and patronising. They wish to send him to a retirement village at one stage in the film.Eastwood, now reaching his early eighties himself, brings believability to the frailty of this old man at the end of his life. He injects the character with humour through his deadpan and raspy voice, as well his ferocious snarls and growls. It is familiar territory for Eastwood to be playing a cranky old mentor who has seen it all, not too dissimilar to the character he played in Million Dollar Baby (he even argues with a priest here). Yet Walt is more obnoxious and more fearless and uncompromising in his approach to people. It is perhaps a more difficult character because of how unlikable he should be. But Eastwood remains in scintillating form here and is still one of Hollywood's coolest customers. The humour of the film, courtesy of both the script and Eastwood's delivery, makes it difficult to dismiss Walt entirely, despite his prejudices. Walt's wit makes him more tolerable to watch on screen and many of the laughs throughout the film are derived from how blunt and rude he is. Without this humour the character Walt may not have been as likable or given the audience much reason to care about what he does. Similarly, from the beginning of the film as well, it is easy to evoke sympathy and understand why Walt is so grizzled and cranky, given the death of his wife and the selfishness of the people around him. The script has been very smartly thought out and written here.It is with this slightly lighter tone that the film is never quite as heavy as Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. Granted there is still an explosive and emotional climax. Although, it is certainly not the one that Dirty Harry enthusiasts would be expecting. Further removing the film from Dirty Harry saga is also the redemptive qualities of Eastwood's character. Walt, having been so removed from his family, finds that he can still connect with the Asian family next door, in particular Thao, who he acts as a teacher and role model to. Thankfully though, these scenes, like in Eastwood's other films, avoid sentimentality entirely. The Australian movie magazine Empire criticised the film for Walt's transition being too sudden, but there are efforts in the film and its script that ensure it remains credible. Despite the changes in Walt, his characterisation remains highly consistent. He is still grizzled and skeptical about the people he begins to mingle with. Yet it is not beyond him to see the good in people, regardless of their nationality, as he says to himself: 'I have more in common with these gooks than my own spoiled, rotten family.' The growth here, and perhaps to an extent the redemption, is what separates Eastwood's character from Harry Callaghan again. It is this change as Walt reconnects with people, in particular the young boy, which provides the film with its narrative direction and growth. Had it been expanded and drawn out, rather than compressed as it is, it may not have been as engaging.Gran Torino may not have the poignancy of Million Dollar Baby or the confrontation of Mystic River, yet it is still such an engaging and often very funny film because of the central performance by Eastwood. There is little doubt that he is still one of Hollywood's strongest talents. It is his film and he dominates it with a performance that shows humour, anger and occasionally guilt. As a director, nearing the end of his career, Gran Torino remains an expression of Eastwood's maturity and skill to deal with such large and universal ideas, like the tolerance of culture.

Eastwood plays a greedy and in a way unfulfilled character but a very wise man who knows how to make himself understood. A war veteran which fought in Coreea he hated coreans.

In the end he, to my pleasant surprise, played a very complex character who expands as the movie continues. By the end of the movie we as viewers finally get to know him.If this is indeed Clint's curtain call, I cannot think of a better way for him to exit the stage. Leaving us all wanting just a little bit more.For those who are Eastwood fans, this is a must see. For those who are not, watch it and prepare to be converted. 0.0020370370370370594\n"

There is the sense of humor, perhaps nothing new here from Clint on the technical side, but there is something very well weighed out in the combination of setting, acting and above all - pace. This film takes it's time and tells it's story and it does so in a rich flavor. It's surprising how often new films nowadays ignore this point because for some reason they have to make too many fast cuts and put too much stuff in there - just as if to make sure at least some scene hits the mark to please everyone an maximize the profit. As seen in this film, there is no need to, if you know what you're doing.It's clear from the beginning that this is a film where the main responsibility is on one actor's shoulders alone. It a lot about heroism from one man's view alone. Many male actors seem to go along this path. Clint Eastwood it perhaps the best example. He can pull it off like few others. It's not an easy thing to do nowadays, people expect something more from the plot, and just few twists and surprises won't do. So what's different about this film?For me this film succeeds because I can so easily relate to it. It's about a an old man seeing all these things going wrong around him, unwilling to confront anything good that might come out of it. I'm not an old man, but my grandfather was, and he fought in WW2 against the soviets. He survived, but it must have left some scars, and he was very reluctant in revealing anything about the horrors he might have seen. He was all about respect. During the last years of his life he must have seen me as Walt sees most of the younger people around him. Are these idiot's going to rule the world after I'm gone? My grandfather never said anything, one look at me when I was around 13 and useless for anything but being lazy and playing computer games, was enough.Although that's mostly because how this film was directed I still have to give credit to the younger cast for portraying confused teenagers quite well. Christopher Carley also does a good job as priest serving as the only link to the authorities - the police are very busy elsewhere it seems. At times you can't help comparing this to a good old western where the sheriff is forced to clean up the town. Perhaps that's the point, for the sake of entertainment. That works for me at least. And the end completely surprised me, because:\"Ever noticed how you come across somebody once in a while that.. you shouldn't have f*d with!?\"There are these old guys you simply don't mess with. They have dealt with the really big messes of our recent history. Be it the Korean war or any other war and no matter whose side they were on, it must have been hell. You can perhaps afford to be young and stupid, but they couldn't. 0.11388189935064931\n",
      "This is undoubtedly the most overlooked film of the year. How this could virtually be left out of the Oscars is absolutely unfathomable. It is a much stronger film than Million Dollar Baby and yet that managed to win best picture. Clint Eastwood proves again that he is one of those rare talents that who is equally brilliant in front of and behind the camera. In what is perhaps his greatest performance, Clint creates the unforgettable Walt. The film is incredibly haunting. Clint manages to turn a rather ordinary story into an absolute tour de force that looks at our culture today, with an ending will make your heart stop. The song that plays at the, that was BY FAR the best song this year, is devastatingly beautiful and powerful. It is downright blasphemy that it was ignored at the Oscars. 0.4578947368421053\n",
      "Well, it's not a comedy, but i didn't think i would laugh so much while watching this film. Clint's character Walt, is a believable, yet outrageous old racist who says what he wants to say. The movie is touching and sad, but also hilarious at times. It is funny to watch these young, tough guys cower for this old guy, but the old guy is Clint Eastwood! who wouldn't? I liked how he didn't use actors in many of the roles, this move was effective in making it seem like real people instead of bigger characters. After the movie, Clint sings a song with Bruce Springsteen. The song is OK, but Clint can't really sing-he just rasps.

So much clichés, so much annoying bravery moments...Eastwood had so much to deal with justice in the past that he's become a paragon of virtue, an ersatz of director.

      "First off, I'd like to give a perspective on my comment as this is something I never do. I rarely bother voting on movies, and this is the first comment I have ever taken the time to make. It's not that I don't love movies, as I am a major movie buff, but seldom do I watch a movie that moves me so greatly as to spur me into commenting. This movie is one of those. I won't go into details, as I don't want to spoil the movie, but I will say that this movie moved me in a very deep way and that it is one of the most touching movies I have ever watched. The story is a bit slower than I expected. I admit I didn't expect an all out action movie, but I did expected more than this movie delivered. However, the richness of the story, as well as the deepness of the characters more than made up for the difference in what I expected and what I received in watching this movie.

I did not know him personally because he passed before I was born. But family members have told me how he struggled with PTSD in his later years.

      "It's hard to believe that Eastwood is almost 80 and still going this strong. I really enjoyed the subtle nuances of this movie and while it was a little predictable--I knew half an hour in that Eastwood would die and leave the car to the kid--I didn't anticipate the way it would end or Walt's final act, which was really great. Much has been made of the racist comments of this character, but I would pose the attitude that it is less important how you talk, than it is how you act. Walt may talk racist, but he's inherently not when it comes to judging people by their essence, as is shown by his championing of the Hmung family that he comes to know. I would also like to take issue with someone on this board who said it was unrealistic for Walt to suddenly stop to fix a rocking washing machine for the family he hardly knew. Actually, this is exactly what my father would have done, a man very similar in style and attitudes to WAlt Kowalski. It was like a compulsion for men of this generation--if they came across something broken, they would fix it. That was what being a man was all about in this generation. It's incredible to think this film was so overlooked at the Oscars. But maybe that's because there was actually very little violence and too much thought provoking action. Bravo to Eastwood for giving us a film about ideas and not just automatic weapons. 0.05464015151515152\n",
      "I thought the most crucial line in this film comes when the young Asian girl states 'because you're an American' to Walt. Walt, a little confused, asks 'Whats that supposed to mean?' Clint Eastwood is the American tough guy embodiment - in some ways, his big characters represent America, or a certain view of the ultimate American hero. Gran Torino celebrates, then kills this myth, something Eastwood seems to have been working towards for some time now. Gran Torino recasts a wizened version of the ultimate tough guy, brash, unyielding and racist, but places him in the world of today, which is the future of America. We still marvel at how damn cool Eastwood is when he brings the justice, but in this film, it is a joy to watch how he takes his own mythical qualities, built by Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, and rewrites them. The film is complete with violent climax, which some have said was over the top, but which I believe is absolutely vital if the above reading of the film is taken, because of the way it flips the typical Eastwood bloodbath on its head, and symbolically, farewells this wiser version of the American Hero without compromising its air of greatness one bit. -0.006212370005473455\n",
      "I think this is one of those movies that at first leaves you kinda lukewarm, but over time will become a true classic. That is the main reason why I gave it a 7 out of 10 and not a 5 out of 10.The story is shallow in content, it is racial, it is politically incorrect, but it is also true and real and unapologetic. It is that combination that will make this movie end up in the same pantheon as Crash, as Babel, as Doubt, as Seven Pounds. Movies that make you think about the content, and it will keep you thinking about it. Therein lies its strength, not in the acting, not in the spectacular dialog, not in the action scenes. It is the truth behind the story that will make this movie being regarded as great.Another reason for its inevitable greatness is the fact that Clint Eastwood shows himself as an old man and he is not afraid to show that his character is hopefully out of touch with today's world, today's society, today's technology ... but he still has a passion to instill virtues and values in the people he cares for.Don't just dismiss this movie based on Clint's stereotypical acting, on the stereotypical typecasting, but base your rating on the lessons you can take away from this movie. 0.0025000000000000135\n",
      "Warning: there will be multiple spoilers contained herein and I will give ample warning in advanced.Walt is a bitter, old bigot whose views on life in general have been galvanized by war, family issues and his ever-changing neighborhood. He also is mourning the loss of his wife. His constant racist remarks are actually funny in spite of themselves. I have learned an entire vocabulary of nasty sayings because of this film.The more you get to know Walt, the more you start to see why he is the way he is and you feel bad for the guy. He doesn't have the best relationship with his son, something that he feels bad about. He's basically alone until some new neighbors move in next door.Thao, one of his new next door neighbors is a troubled Hmong youth whose (Spoiler) gang initiation is to steal Walt's prized muscle car, a 1972 Gran Torino that he made off of the line when he was working for Ford.Spoilers: At the funeral of his wife near the beginning, there is a scene where you see the grand daughter at her grandmother's funeral, dressed like a slut, exposing a belly button ring and a lip ring and she text messages on her phone during the funeral. At this point the film tries to do two things; one is that you can see the irritation on Walt's face at how times had changed and not necessarily for the better. Then you get it from the point of view of the kid and you see how the parents don't care. Yes, times have changed but it's a funeral! The grand daughter then goes on to ask dear old grandad (that she doesn't give a damn about) for a couch.He doesn't like Thao right from the beginning and for obvious reasons but later you find that his relationship with Thao and with his sister Sue are the best relationships he has. The interactions throughout the movie with Walt and the Priest are awesome! The confession scene is pretty hilarious too.(More Spoilers) Toward the halfway mark in the film things start getting more serious, there is gang violence, rape and ultimately death. The movie takes you on one hell of a ride but it's something that doesn't leave you feeling horrible despite the sad nature of the ending. It actually serves to give closure to Walt and to all around him. For me, a great moment was at the end when you see that his Son and Grand Daughter are both equally disappointed that neither of them inherited his prized Gran Torino. Despite Walt's grumpy and unpleasant nature, you really come to like the guy. He's a good person, he stands up for what is right and he does the most just and noble thing at the end in the name of saving the only people that truly cared about him.This is a must see film! 0.11012130230880231\n",
      "Clint Eastwood's 'Gran Torino', his first movie in 4 years since 2004's 'Million Dollar Baby', delves into the tired life of retired Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski, who has found himself living right next door to a family of Hmong Asians. The story explores the complications of racial boundaries, and is mainly driven by the development of relationships between the different characters more than anything else.The film acts as a modern-age American ideology film, as Walt continuously fights to protect his own property against intruders. But his intentions quickly become misconceived as heroism by his neighbors, and he suddenly finds himself with more to care about than his own lawn. The plot of this movie relied primarily on the actions and reactions of the characters that are at odds. We see periodically through a series of harsh, embarrassing, and life-threatening events how two people who have no interest in establishing a relationship can come to caring enough to fight for each other's honor.We start to learn a lot more about the intentions of each character in this movie through these events, and while Walt holds on to his racial grudges, he shows compassion and dignity towards the less fortunate people around him. Throughout the movie he persistently mispronounces the other characters' names, calling Thao \"Toad\" and his girl fancy \"Yum Yum\", even after they find themselves in a good standing relationship. His casual interactions with his barber reveal that it may not just be a racist grudge after all.What I loved most about Eastwood's character in this film was that he turned a grumpy, hateful, racist old man, who would probably be viewed as an antagonist in any other movie, into a very likable and awesome main protagonist of the movie. His whole \"bad ass\" persona and old timer knowledge fortifies that likeabilty of his character, and really is one of the things that makes this movie so great. 0.20307539682539683\n",
      "It's not one of the best Clint Eastwood has done but it still is a very good film. I could easily put aside some of the poor acting ability that supports this film and give it a 10 based purely on the story and the great Eastwood presence. After watching this twice i found it extremely funny and sad at the same time. It's been compared to others that i won't mention but personally i didn't think that at all. It's definitely something different from what Eastwood has done in the past and it has a lot of heart. It's a thumbs up from me. Will be watching this movie again. I'm not sure why this film has had so many bad reviews, given the amount of trash that gets shat out all too often. It has its flaws but it is definitely worthy of more than a 1.

      "Over the past 5 decades Clint Eastwood has been an icon in film making , creating wonderful, entertaining films mostly with a greater ,deeper message .Starting from the great fun of the good the bad and the ugly as an actor , and a male icon , and ending with the world war II epic Letters from Iwo Jima as a tremendous director.Now at 78, and closing on 79, Clint successfully and brilliantly directed Gran Torino, his latest and one of his best films in the last two decades . Gran Torino , revolves around an old man Walter Kowalski who suffers with his life after the death of his longtime wife , Walt (the name he doesn't like to be called with) tries to make a man of a shy unsocial , and slightly disturbed Hmong teenager (Tao) who is indirectly forced to steal his Gran Torino by his gangster cousins.As always Eastwood almost perfectly directed the screenplay , which contains a balanced amount of comedy and tragedy spread carefully during the whole events of the movie . Clint made a bunch of brilliant scenes and I very much like the two scene where he deliberately draws his hand as a fake gun , the last scene of Walt's death was altogether strong , tragic , and joyful for justice has been done by the his sacrifice which lead to the arrest of the Hmong gangsters .Clint made a powerful , funny , and emotional performance , which I truthfully think should at least get an Academy Award nomination .Finally I probably should end my review with the a praise of the skillfully composed , astonishingly written , gently performed soundtrack song named the same the movie Gran Torino , which was the icing on the cake . 0.17880952380952386\n",
      "A lot has been written about this film - Clint's last acting gig, an old Dirty Harry - a supposedly great film. It was not great but I enjoyed it. I think the thing with Eastwood is - you either like him or you don't. I like him. Sure he's made some terrible films in the past (Absolute Power anyone?) but he more than makes up for those with his good ones (Dollars trilogy/Josey Wales). This is not his best nor his worst outing.The character he plays is a Korean war veteran who finds himself alone in the world after the death of his wife. His neighbourhood is almost entirely occupied by Asians and after 50 years working on the Ford assembly line - finds himself with nothing in common with his kids and his only friend is his dog. Most films these days are so PC that they lose all remnants of believability - not so this one. Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski calls it as he sees it - and does not hold back on the insults. Especially race-related ones.So what happens here? Not much really. It is a slow piece of work with no big moments (until the end) and follows the relationship between an aging old man and a good-hearted naïve young Asian boy next door. Now that sounds a little seedy if taken out of context ;-) But somehow it seems to work. Despite the bad acting from some of the Asian actors (who can be excused as it was their first time in front of a camera) and a priest actor who is in my mind the most blandest, irrelevant, worst-acted character in the whole movie (this guy could have coloured the movie a bit if Clint put in a heavy hitter for this part - I kept thinking Norton as I watched) - the movie still has some good things going for it. The storyline is okay without being spectacular and the references to the Gran Torino in the title was not strong enough for me. But Clint's character is like so many of his previous reincarnations - that you just have to root for him.But it is not without its faults: - The editing at times seem to make basic chronological mistakes. Eastwood does tend not to follow normal film-making rules when editing films with characters popping up all over the place in adjacent scenes - but a special mention here must go to the scene where Eastwood is smoking in the bath. He tells his dog to go easy on him smoking in the house as he never does that. Yet 5 minutes EARLIER we see him smoking in the living room with no such problems. - Believability is stretched at times. Eastwood pulls up to three black guys hassling Sue's character. He stares them all down and spits on the ground ala Josey Wales' \"You gonna pull them pistols or whistle Dixie\" scene. The youths are big, scary black guys - Clint is old, decrepit and even though he pulls a gun eventually - the menace is no longer there. He also manages to beat up a gang-hardened youth on the kid's front lawn. As much as I want the 78 year old 'Man-with-no-name' throwback to exact some vengeance - is it credible? No. - Irrelevant scenes permeate the film too. Okay - it is hard to stretch out this story as not much happens but there are still some things which do not advance the story one little bit. The barber for instance adds nothing of worth to the plot - and if those scenes were not there - nobody would notice. However - having said that, the second scene where Thao has to talk tough in the barber shop is hilarious. - The acting. Hmmm. Dodgy. Clint is fine - as usual - and so is the girl Asian - Sue. The priest is terrible, Thao hit and miss and some of the Asian gang leave a lot to be desired too. But can you blame these guys? No - it is their first time. Can you blame Clint for putting them up there? Maybe - a little. - The end. I won't give it away but I'd be surprised if you don't see it from a mile off. Clint gives plenty of hints as to what's coming.For me Gran Torino was an enjoyable watch - slow but engaging - not without faults but the overall movie misses its mark on too many occasions to be truly considered great. 7/10. 0.06772258711913887\n",

If this was a made-for-TV movie then I'd give this a higher rating. And I'm not giving this a low rating because of Clint's talking chair rant at the 2012 GOP Convention that nominated Mitt Romney.I can think of numerous Eastwood movies that contained more insight but Gran Torino was pretty much by the numbers, and rather grossly stereotypical. Walt was stereotypical, the Hmong community stereotypical. I even read that the Hmong cast weren't even invited to a cast and crew baseball match, because it was assumed they wouldn't be interested in baseball even though all were born in the USA to paraphrase Bruce Springsteen. Really, does Walt hate all Asians because of his Korean War experience?

      "I first watched Gran Turino just a few weeks ago. I didn't know what to expect but from the previews back in 2008, it looked interesting. I never thought it would be as funny as it was. I guess it's not supposed to be but I was laughing at least every couple minutes. Clint Eastwood's character was a crotchety, racist old war veteran who lived next to an Asian family. Throughout the duration of the movie, Mr. Eastwood must have unleashed ten different racial slurs a total of 30 times. He was just nasty in general towards a couple different races of people. It was comical to watch, not because I have a problem with other races, but because he was so grumpy and it's just a movie.As far as the plot goes, it was actually a good movie. It was nice to see him become friends with the Asian boy and his family, and how he saved the girl from the young men who were harassing her. I would recommend this movie. 0.06630434782608695\n",
      "Gran Torino is a film that has stood the test of time and is always worth a watch. The main character of Walt is pretty strong, but has much to be desired. Making the script more general eliminated making the movie feel outdated or old and decreased obvious plot holes in the film. Why wasn't there more scenes that gave the audience imagery on just how much Walt missed his wife? The movie was surprisingly funny, but seemed one sided when it was almost always Clint Eastwood dishing out the jokes. The acting was not fantastic and it did not really need to be, the priest was just an odd character choice and his acting was weak. I see a few comments about the editing in the movie extending past the scenes and I think it is the best transition you could get in most of them. The scene with the white boy and the black street thugs made very little sense and in my opinion did not add much, the fact that this smart girl was even hanging out with the white boy was laughable. The ending was fantastic and was truly what made this film good. The entire film was good at engaging and intriguing the audience though, the script really kept reoccurring characters to a minimum which was wise here. The film established a time line at the barbershop by letting the audience know he was there every three weeks which was good, but that script also collapsed on itself by making these character undergo radical changes in such a short amount of time.

He then acts all high and mighty only to prove that people can get hurt that way.

      "Clint Eastwood, you're done! No more! I'm sure you thought that your rough n tough character Walt was all you needed to reprise your self as an actor, but sadly, your character lacked real depth. Oh no, I said it! Real depth, not character depth, but human depth. You have a name, which is good, character's should have a name, but you forgot the rest, and I don't think you left it at home. Somehow though, people liked your movie, but instead of picking out their reasons and systematically breaking them down, I'd rather just write, quite simply, why I thought this was a bad movie.If your going to post \"Genius\" or \"Masterpiece\", you better have a lengthy explanation as to why you used such over-used and overly mundane descriptors for your heading. This movie is far from \"masterpiece\", and closer to \"I don't care if it's on HBO, I'm not watching it.\" So here it goes...Firstly, the screenplay is filled with first time screenplay clichés, which seems to act accordingly, seeing as Eastwood chose a fairly non-established writer. I'm cool with that, in fact, that is awesome. However, you can't just do that and assume because it is a young script, that you can ignore what's wrong with it. Simply said, beginner screenwriters make beginner mistakes.Character connection is huge, which is why dialogue is in turn huge. When a character makes a decision, you, as the writer, have to ask, why are they doing this? Or would they do this? When you start making decisions that result in, what some writers refer to as, stretching, you have the makings of a loosely organized film.So here are some questions...Are there people who are so racists and so outspoken, that even in the house of someone who they deem beneath them, they would consistently call them by racial slurs? Or continue to eat and drink their food, while they do so? Or even be in their house? No.Now, would that same person, in the same scene, change from an elderly racists with war time experience that further enhances his bigotry, change his ways by the end of the scene and be merry? No.Are Blacks welcoming to White supremacists? No. So why is that the Hmongs are? Is it because, racism wise, being a racists against Asians is not as bad as being racists against Blacks? No.Living literally 5 minutes from the scene where the White guy and female lead were harassed, I tried to pay close attention to the acting, just to make sure it was fitting. It looked like they plucked a white guy from Grosse Pointe, put him in a FUBU jump suit and Perry Ellis jacket and told him, \"try and act ghetto.\" With that simple statement came the simple acting by none other than the son of Clint Eastwood, Scotty. Stick to clinging onto your dad's coat tale to attend premiers, and leave the acting to those not trying to prove something.As for the other actors, several, or a majority of their lines, had little or no emotion, connection to character in the scene, believability, and finesse. Now some will say, \"hey, they were first time actors, give them a break.\" No, I won't. There are thousands of better actors out there, with experience, and ability to really connect to their characters emotions. It was like watching a middle school TV Lab project. Clint stuck out as a sore thumb, on a hand with broken fingers.Wow he growled, my God, let us hoist him in the air! My god, he growled again, this guy is really onto something...wait...wait...no, no this isn't right. There is a reason why Clint Eastwood never received and acting Academy Award, he is not that good of an actor. He is one dimensional, mono-thematic, and down right tiresome to watch. Although his experience definitely showed amongst the virgin gang of actors, he \"hand plucked\" out of thousands of teens, it still was not even par worthy.This movie has beginner written all over it, and it's not opinion. The beginner Hmong actors, no actual recognition, whether it be awards or praise from worthy critics. The beginner screenwriter, no actual recognition. Clint Eastwood, nice Golden Globe nomination, I'm sure you would have really cherished that award, too bad.Lastly, I will explain the heading...\"Surprise, Surprise...\"Surprise, Surprise to all those who thought this movie was going to sweep at the Oscars, to all those who thought this movie would get some Oscars, to all those who thought it would even get A Oscar, to all those who thought this movie presented something noteworthy.That this movie is in the TOP 250 is a disgrace, and proves that IMDb, despite however useful it is, is only a website, and doesn't make any BIG decision, because, quite simply, it can't. 0.11396279159437053\n",
      "I am a big Clint Eastwood fan and i enjoyed Gran Torino, although it had a few flaws with the acting.So basically it's about a retired Korean war veteran called Walt Kowalski who's wife has just died and is living by himself. He hates his kids, grand kids and his neighbors who are Chinese. He is also pretty racist and is feisty.The main story is about his next door neighbor 'Thao' who has a cousin in a gang and they force Thao into stealing Walt's 1972 vintage Gran Torino. Walt then catches someone in his shed and then finds out it was him. Then one night the gangs try to take Thao away because he failed. Walt then comes out and that is when the one man war begins.To sum up it is a good film, but the acting from Thao is a bit dodgy. 0.11805555555555557\n",
      "To tell a story of a man, struggling with his faith, nearing the end of his life takes dedication to detail. This film does exactly that.

A crossroad in his life sets in motion a chain of events that keeps the viewer wondering what path he will take and how he will handle himself from that point on. Knowing that he has the power to change a person's life forever, Walt makes a decision to help others in need, even when it is to his own detriment.

      "One of my personal favourites, Gran Torino is one of those films that lingers on your mind long after watching it. The story is of an unlikely friendship that begins and ends with the protagonist's, Walt Kowalski's, Gran Torino. A veteran from the Korean War, Walt, spends his days trying to prove to everyone that he's the most cynical person they've ever met. Set in a poor, crime infested neighbourhood, young Tao from next door is pressured into stealing Walt's prized possession, the Gran Torino, as a symbol of his loyalty to his gang member relatives. Upon failing, Tao returns to Walt's house offering his services as a handy man as punishment for his crime. As friendships develop between the two most unlikely of friends, Walt realized that he may just have more in common with his local Hmong neighbours than he originally thought. Clint Eastwood gives his all, as both director and actor, in this film as he strips away the romanticised idea of friendship to uncover it's raw beauty and emotion, one that comes with both joy and sacrifice. 0.04412393162393162\n",
      "The war comes home to roost for one man, a Korean War veteran, the man does what comes naturally to him when there's a conflict, in spite of his advanced age, he still maintains a soldier mentality and runs toward danger. Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood) is an evergreen soldier; the olive hue of his camouflage fatigues bled into his skin. Faced with an encounter among two Hmong clans, the third party picks a side, the lesser of two evils, just as he did in Korea, and performs his duty with emotional detachment. The Hmong gang-banger who harasses his cousin is analogous to the rogue soldier and the helpless citizen that pit Korea against Korea, a civil war of sorts, just like the one reprising itself in this Michigan ghetto. Although Walt remedies the crisis by defending the defenseless, it's strictly business with him; it's his job. After the gang-affiliated boys drive off, Walt tells his grateful neighbors to get off his lawn; they're no different from the gang-bangers, whom he issued the same directive, in the same admonishing tones. This objectivity is no mere act of humbleness; he wants this Hmong family on the other side of his property, or better yet, on the other side of the ocean.Prior to accepting Sue's invitation for a barbecue at her family's house, this charming Hmong girl and her shy younger brother Thao(Bee Vang), as a result of happenstance after happenstance, unknowingly helped the xenophobe evolve into a politically incorrect curmudgeon, by possessing the personal qualities sadly lacking in his grandchildren. Still, old habits die hard, so the occasional racist slip manages itself into their otherwise affable dialogues, which belies a lingering overtone of white superiority. The turning point of Walt Kowalski's re-education eventuates itself in the Hmong family's basement, site of the aforementioned barbecue, where the once unneighborly neighbor recognizes the glancing looks a pretty girl shoots Thao's way. Isolated from the other party revelers, Walt approaches the young man, this time, in a mentoring capacity, to tell him that he's a \"p****\", an all-encompassing derogatory moniker which differs from the racial-specific digs that are intrinsic to Walt's lexicon. The old man has turned a corner. In an ensuing scene, at the barbershop, when Walt's barber calls Thao a \"c****\", the audience(depending on the audience) understands that this polarizing word lost its original dynamism as a term of demeanment, the minute that Walt truly befriended his Hmong charge. Being called a \"c****\" now, signifies that Thao is no longer the \"other\". Walt's approval has the effect of assimilating the Hmong boy; he's just one of the guys. Thao is the \"c****\", the barber is the \"d***\", and the grizzled, old widower is the \"p******\".As \"Unforgiven\" commented on the morality of violence in this actor/filmmaker's body of work that pertains to the Western genre, \"Gran Turino\" is a remonstration of the vigilantism component inherent in Don Siegel's \"Dirty Harry\", and its ensuing sequels(\"Magnum Force\", \"The Enforcer\", \"Sudden Impact\", and \"The Dead Pool\"). The seminal 1971 film that introduced Detective Harry Callahan to the world, began with the reprobate law official taunting, then gunning down, a black man in cold blood. In \"Gran Turino\", as Sue(Ahney Her) is being accosted by a group of dark-skinned locals, \"Dirty Harry\" reverberations can be felt in Walt's symbolic pulling of the trigger at the black youths. He gives them the finger. He gives the Hmong gang the finger, too. The anti-violence message of \"Unforgiven\" might have gotten lost during the film's climactic bloodbath, but this time, the message is made manifest through its reinterpretation of that final sequence where the anti-hero gunslinger confronts his personal demons. -0.015679012345679002\n",
      "From the first scenes it is obvious Dirty Harry is back, older but just as tough. But we soon find there is a humorous and even gentle side to Walt.As he starts to develop a relationship, such as it is, with his Hmong neighbors, he remains gruff, but gradually softens. And as he does so, you have to laugh, for some reason.\"These Hmong broads are like badgers,\" he mutters to himself.It's not easy to do the Dirty Harry sneer. Just try it. It requires underplaying. And doing it while bringing a chuckle or smile is great acting. You suspect there is another Walt underneath, winking at you.The proof that his tough, racist talk is a front, even a running joke, comes when he takes Tao to the barber, telling him just before they enter, \"Now you're gonna learn how guys talk. You just listen to how Martin and I banter back and forth.\" What follows is some of the most foul, racist epithets you could imagine. And you realize it is a way for minorities to toughen themselves up, including Walt.\"Perfect, a pollack AND a chink,\" says the \"Italian\" barber as they walk in.It is emotional armor plating. You see parallels in the displays of toughness by the Hmong gang, the black gang and the white boyfriend. Perhaps it is part of the American immigrant experience. It is part of Walt, that tough guy demeanor. But he doesn't have anything to prove; he knows it is an act, and isn't. His is not the tough front hiding a coward, like the gangs.The movie can also be painfully sad, as when he finally goes to the doctor and encounters a woman, Dr. Chang, in place of his old doctor who retired three years before. Along with the foreign nurse who can't even pronounce his name and the other foreigners in the waiting room, you can begin to feel the aging Walt's pain in seeing his world crumble beneath him. Imagine all that you had known since childhood and adulthood changed almost beyond recognition. It is his equivalent to the Hmong trying desperately to hold onto their old world traditions.What counts is not the color or language or dress, but the values. Good manners are important to Walt. But even more is being a good, hard working American. He sees his children losing those values, but he finds them again in the new immigrants, who come to mean more to him than his family. He has purpose in his life, again.As Tao is locked in the basement you see Walt through the metal screen finally admitting what happened in Korea.\"Not a day goes by that I don't think about it,\" he confesses, as he prepares for the showdown. \"You don't want that on your soul.\"You feel Walt's pain. You feel a lot of emotions as the film progresses. And, at the end, you feel redemption.A great film is not to be found simply in a storyline. It is found in the characters, whom you get to know and understand and care about. And, most of all, it is in the character development. That is the strength of Gran Torino. However, there is something more.Gran Torino is a statement about America and what it means to be an American. To think it is about racism in America would be a big mistake; after all, this is a film by an American. If anything, I feel, America, because of its long history of diversity, has moved beyond intolerance more than most countries; the Hmong moved to America because they were victims of genocide in Asia, remember? So don't go calling America racist; there's a big difference between foul language and genocide. The movie is saying you can find racism anywhere, in any group. Yes, it is a call for understanding and tolerance.But what it is really saying is we are all immigrants, or our ancestors were, and many were refugees, like the Hmong; that's what the Statue of Liberty is about. When the torch is passed to a new generation, sometimes they are a new immigrant group. It is up to them not simply to be \"good Americans,\" but to be good human beings, to care about your neighbors and your community, to see beyond superficial differences and become part of that melting pot we call America.In the first drive by shooting, the Hmong didn't talk to police, staying apart, as was their custom. In the second shooting, they did, and the police finally had witnesses, plenty of them. They were no longer Hmong, they were Americans. That was Walt's legacy. That must have really made Walt's day. 0.09504221906565659\n",
      "This film could have been fantastic, yet in my opinion it ended up as a complete joke. The plot was actually the best thing about this movie, however what could have been a great and inspirational story was ruined by shocking dialogue, horrendous acting (both by the often reliable Clint and the younger stars of the film), and some of the most twee and obvious motifs i have ever seen, take the way Clint falls in the Jesus position in the major last scene as an example of this.I found myself sitting in the cinema and laughing out loud at how ridiculous some of the dialogue was, the blatant overuse of derogatory terms for Asian people was unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, i understand the need to portray the war vet Walt as a man who has some serious issues with his past and the way his neighbourhood has been over-run by south-east Asian families, however the never-ending stream of abuse got old after around twenty minutes of watching.Walts character was so overplayed by Eastwood, i honestly thought i was sitting in a slap-stick comedy and had somehow missed that fact in the trailers and marketing for the film. The two back-to-back scenes two thirds of the way through the film firstly the one in which Walt goes to the construction site to sort out a job for \"Slug\" followed by the visit to the barbers shop where Walt attempts to teach him how to \"talk like a man\" have got to be two of the worst scenes i have ever sat through, and again i found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous the whole thing was. Even down to the fact that Walts young mentor, when being burned on the face with a cigarette, screams as though he's been shot, it was just so over the top.As i left the cinema, rushing to get out as the first credits rolled up, as i felt i could no longer contain myself to be serious and suitably moved, i heard a man say, \"oh my god, that has got to be one of the best films i have ever seen\". Now perhaps i'm missing something here, but i'm pretty positive that the best part about Gran Torino is the Gran Torino. 0.07252209595959595\n",

      "***SPOILERS*** Gran Torino: It Will Drive You CrazyIn several neighborhoods in the United States, there is a mix of cultures. There are certain places where this multi culture is more evident than others. The different ways of living of people have, as a consequence, an impact on the relationship between neighbors. \"Gran Torino\" makes an outstanding job demonstrating an uncommon relationship in a Michigan neighborhood. An interesting drama that makes the viewer sympathize with the characters, will definitely keep the audience interested.Situated in a middle class neighborhood in Michigan, Gran Torino tells the story of Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood). After the death of his wife, Mr. Kowalski starts to develop a relationship with his Hmong neighbors. Thao (Bee Vang), who lives right next door, is forced by his cousin and his gang to steal Mr. Kowalski's classic Gran Torino as an initiation to the gang. Walt, being a war veteran, scares him away. He then starts to develop a relationship with Sue (Ahney Her) when he saved her and her boyfriend from being robbed by another gang in the neighborhood. Walt continues to protect the Hmong family from the danger of the neighborhood, and consequently starts to get along with his neighbors and basically train Thao.The character of Walt Kowalski is played by the famous actor and director Clint Eastwood. His knowledge and experience is definitely evident throughout the movie. Mr. Kowalski presents a very tough personality, that has a crude temperament and is usually not joyful about life. He is an old war veteran and thus, knows how crude life can be. Clint Eastwood makes a convincing performance that definitely demonstrates why he has been so successful in the world of cinema. On the other hand, the Hmong characters showed a very novice performance. The lack of experience by both Bee Vang and Ahney Her is noticeable. Even though they do not show an outstanding job, it is not obvious enough to make it interfere with the general understanding of the movie.The movie does not have an amazing plot. Unlike other good movies, it has a relatively simple plot. Even though it does not have a complex plot, it manages to keep the audience interested. The amazing execution of Clint Eastwood and the interesting character of Walt Kowalski is doubtlessly a great way to keep the viewer interested in what is going to go down. The director, Clint Eastwood, did an amazing job showing small scenes that mean important things. For example, the scenes where the main characters coughs blood. At first, it seems like an important event for the plot, but throughout the movie it happens several times with no consequence, but that definitely does not mean that it is not important. It is important because it shows how physically affected is the health of Mr. Kowalski and gives a reasonable explanation for why he sacrifices himself in the end. Mr. Kowalski knew that he had not so many time left, so he decided to make one last heroic action for a family he appreciated. The movie also does an incredible job making the audience sympathize with Walt. Mr. Kowalski has a very crude personality, but the person who worked on the script, Nick Schenk and Clint Eastwood himself managed to make the viewer feel sorry for him.This movie shows how every person is capable of developing a relationship with someone else no matter what the context is. \"Gran Torino\" exhibits an interesting and diverse part of human nature. Mr. Kowalski little by little starts to develop an amazing relationship with Thao, and this all started because he tried to steal his car. The movie shows how human beings protect the people they care about for instinct. There are also secondary values that are taught by the movie. The relationship between everyone's own family, for example. Mr. Kowalski's grandsons showed him a disrespectful attitude, suggesting not only how much this can affect a person, but how important is the relationship between father and children. The fact that Walt kept a bad relationship with his son, influenced on the way his grandchildren treated him. People can learn important values from this movie but probably the most important one is how a person can take unimaginable risks and do unthinkable things to help and protect people who demonstrate affection.A positive aspect of \"Gran Torino\" is that it can be watched and enjoyed by several types of audiences. Anyone who enjoys good cinema would obviously enjoy this movie because it definitely keeps you interested and gives you a lot to think and discuss . From teenagers to elders, men or women, will appreciate this amazing film. Unfortunately, the movie is R rated for its violence and language but the protection of the audience is always crucial. \"Gran Torino\" without a doubt qualifies like an excellent movie due to its incredible direction and acting. 0.16606438092262832\n",
      "I have always liked Clint and I grew up in the Detroit area so I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, the movie did not deliver. It's biggest weakness (and there are many) is its dated story. The 'angry white guy struggles to come to terms with racial diversity' theme was interesting and relevant in the early 1970s (e.g, All in the Family) but it's very tired and predictable now. Within the first few minutes of the film, you just know that Eastwood's character is going to end up being friends with the Asian family next door.The setting of the film also seemed strangely dated to me. The film showed Eastwood's character all resentful and nostalgic for the time when his neighborhood was all white. However most of those old Detroit neighborhoods began changing 40-50 years ago. The attitudes and reactions of the Eastwood character seemed to belong to someone who was just beginning to experience this change and not someone who had been living with it for 50 years. I think the film would have made more sense if it had been set in the 1960s when these changes were underway rather than today.Clint does have an aura of timelessness about him and he stills look damn good for a guy his age. However, the math in this movie doesn't work. Clint was just too old for the part which of course should not have been written as a Korean War Vet. Korean war vets are now well into their 70s and 80s. I have a hard time imagining guys this age driving around gang infested neighborhoods in Detroit with a pistol. It's even more implausible to think of such a person leaping out of a truck to face down three thugs on a street corner. But there was Clint doing the 'Dirty Harry' shtick well into his 70s. I found myself cringing in these scenes and wishing that Clint would have had a bit more dignity.Clint has had an amazing career but this movie clearly shows that he should retire as both an actor and director. 0.08363799283154123\n",
      "Clint Eastwood shows no signs of slowing as he tirelessly puts out another scintillating cinematic masterpiece that is \"Gran Torino\". This movie focuses on gangs and it's up to our main protagonist (Eastwood) to put an end to their rampage.With violence being the centre of attention, it is executed in a patriotic fashion that has been performed by Americans and approved by their audience. It also concentrates on the benefits of friendship in a way that doesn't manipulate you into too much temptation where we encounter a climatic final showdown. The heroism is not designed to inflate one's ego, but handled in a very intellectual demeanour. There are times when Eastwood gets carried away with his heroic position to the point he ends up looking like Christ, especially in the final scene. In some ways I thought it was one of the more flawed scenes in the movie. I don't find his character to stand synonymous with the Catholic teachings and to be portrayed in such a light-hearted casual fashion. The character's heart-wrenching sacrifice is believable, the gesture itself is handled Biblicly where someone takes something of his/her own to save the life of another human will eternally be magical, no matter how many millions of times it has been executed in movies.Another small qualm is that some actors are less effective than others. It's like they're either trying to hard to keep up and others aren't trying at all.Christopher Carley who played the priest is absolutely abysmal. Bee Vang as Thao, needs to enrol in an actors program. However, Ahney Her was absolutely stunning and impressive as the Thao's intelligent and level-headed sister. When she becomes harassed by the street gangs surrounding the area, we anxiously await for Dirty Harry's longly-needed comeback to come armed and take down these mindless parasites a taste of their blood. As much as awards are rigged, I think Miss Her should have deserved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, because she was the best character in the movie, even usurping Eastwood's Walt Kowalski.For the past two decades, Eastwood has created some very remarkable films. \"Bird\" was a definitive masterpiece, \"Unforgiven\" had enough blood for all those who love a little blood and gore. \"Mystic River\" just oozes with beauty. \"Million Dollar Baby\" gave strong performances by the cast (especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman), but the direction was not one of Eastwood's best. \"Gran Torino\" should have gotten more credit than it has deserved and even though Eastwood is not as young as was (no one is for that matter) he can still pack a punch at 79 years old. 0.21624704491725769\n",
      "This film starts and finishes strong. Eastwood is, as always, Oscar-worthy in this drama of family, friendship, and, like most of his movies, the consequences of violence. Right up to the near ending, I was laughing hysterically. The ending becomes intensely bleak and then back to being spiritually uplifting. The rest of the cast is decent as well. \"Gran Torino\" focuses on the forgiveness of one's sins as well learning to like what you once hated. The subject of \"life and death\" is brought up quite often, which becomes an intriguing topic. Although \"Torino\" is no where near \"Unforgiven,\" (my all-time favorite film)but it is up there. Then again, I love every Clint film. Don't let my opinions make this seem biased though. I definitely suggest seeing this film, it's worth the money and the time. 0.00700280112044819\n",

Maybe your voice has always been a bit breathy but it's time to retire from roles that have too many lines.

It was like non-actors put in front of cameras for the first time - we've all seen it on SNL with non-actor-guests/hosts trying to get their lines out!

He was very good in this movie, except for awkward grunting he did on many occasions, but he wasn't enough. The supporting cast was dreadful. I am not kidding when I say that the only other good performance in this film, other than Clint, was Clint's dog Daisy. All of the Hmong actors were awful. I am aware that all of the Hmong characters were not played by actors, but that is no excuse.

The only reason this movie gets one star is that IMDb does not allow negative ratings. I wish there was an undo for movies watched. -0.094\n",
      "For me, only the prevalence of violence prevents this film gaining an even greater rating. It's one of Clint Eastwood's best roles, but the script is the real star, with most lines zinging off the page. While Walt (Eastwood) is, on the surface, an unattractive character - crotchety, mean, selfish, set in his ways -- gradually you come to understand him, and even love him. He has many good qualities, such as loyalty to his friends, honesty, and willingness to stand up for others and for justice. Underneath his biting wit is harsh experience, hurt and cynicism but also, eventually, a fierce affection for his new Asian neighbours. The film makers take a risk in running many lines about race, although it does highlight the many conflicted tensions of Walt's neighbourhood. And it demonstrates Walt's petty prejudices, despite being from a migrant background himself. I laughed and laughed at many of the lines but then at the end I cried fat tears. The ending was excessively violent but a startling concept, and not out of the realms of possibility, given Walt's extreme character traits. The actor Ahney Her, playing Walt's Hmong neighbour Sue, gives an outstanding performance - full of firey challenges to Walt's racist rants, ignorance, bullsh-t and bravado, even though she is much younger than him. It evolves into a combative but strong affection between them, as she realises there is a heart behind Walt's bitter and tough exterior. 0.15644360269360266\n",

The screenplay is basically a poorly written two hour long racist joke. I don't care who lives or dies and frankly the world would be better off with all the characters dead. If you like Clint Eastwood films, which I do, you will be completely ashamed. Maybe this film was so terrible to me because I had seen \"The Wrestler\" only hours earlier.

      "Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbours, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the old man overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbours.The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief. A check on IMDb reveals that the male Asian lead (Tao) has not had any other parts since this 2008 classic. That would be unthinkable for any other actor who played opposite the great Clint Eastwood. Alas, thank you Mr Eastwood for doing this much for the underrepresented nonetheless. 0.1277027027027027\n",
      "This old school, slow-burning drama manages to spin a delicate, quiet, and respectable yarn for its first two-thirds, offering up a slew of complicated characters, solid dramatic intrigue, and several healthy doses of irreverent humor in the process. But what first starts out as a seemingly basic, \"going-of-age\" mood piece eventually twists beautifully into a searing and poignant ethical study of redemption, sacrifice, and simply doing the right thing. In fact, get this - I actually had the unfortunate pleasure of having this movie's ending spoiled for me before finally seeing it. But, sure enough, even though I knew full well how things were going to come to a close, \"Gran Torino's\" emotional climax still got me. 0.0780952380952381\n",

      "After his wife's death, a bitter old man wants to be left alone but is reluctantly drawn into the lives of his Hmong neighbors. Eastwood takes center stage here both in front of and behind the camera. Approaching his 80th birthday, he shows himself to be in his creative prime. It's not clear if Walt is really a bigot who undergoes a transformation or his gruff demeanor is just a shield he uses to guard his privacy. Perhaps the ambiguity is intentional. If this turns out to be Eastwood's final performance, it's quite a farewell. The scenes in the barber shop are hilarious, especially when Eastwood and Lynch teach Thao how real men talk. However, the finale is not believable. 0.05333333333333334\n",

I know that elder people often look like this and act like this, but Clint went to extreme point. I even wonder how did this sad old man manage to live with golden retriever dog? I used to have a labrador retriever and can say that dogs of such breed will never make you feel sad. OK, Clint tried to act at least. All these \"gooks\" were not acting, but just spending time. Sue and Tao characters were underdeveloped and underperformed. All gangster characters, no matter - black or Asian, were just ridiculous.

      "What is it to be truly happy? What's it like to be a part of a family, for real? This is the only Clint Eastwood (aside from MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN...which he directed) movie I have ever truly enjoyed. Without spoilers, I will say that towards the end of the film, Mr. Eastwood has to do something big and heroic and macho, in true \"dirty Harry\" fashion, but it didn't detract from how much I admired this 2008 effort about a grouchy old veteran of Polish descent, who projects hatred towards Asian people. His wife has recently died, his son and grandkids don't want anything real from him, especially not relationships, and the only thing he seems to lavish affection on is his classic 1972 Gran Torino. The only person he knows who seems to want to reach out to him is a young priest (Chris Carley) and of course he is rebuffed.The old man's new neighbors are a family of Hmong, and after the teenage boy (Bee Vang) tries to get in good with a local Hmong gang by attempting to steal Mr. Kowalski's treasured car, the old man responds with his usual racist scorn. But slowly, after getting to know the boy and his sister (Ahney Her) and their large family, after becoming acquainted with their unique culture, Mr. Kowalski finds an unlikely family, and against his grumpy will, finds himself caring about them and risking his own hide to protect them from the viciousness of the gang their cousin belongs to.Without being preachy, this film accomplished what CRASH tried to several years ago. Kowalski lets go of his prejudice against Asians, gets to know a family and a culture, and suddenly has real friends for the first time in a long time. It is a unique, touching and refreshing film about the sometimes preachy concept of \"racial harmony\". 0.1403848003848004\n",

To watch how a man (Walt) can change because of the friendship of others he has been without possibly his entire life is uplifting.

I understand he used non-actors in most of the Hmong parts, and for the most part it went just fine. A few times Bee Vang's lack of the art came through. A wonderful job was done by Ahney Her. Her charm and beauty lit up the screen, and I was surprised that she wasn't a professional actress. I hope to see her in the future.

It's got action, but so much more too. The dialog in this movie is a little risqué due to the racial slurs and other racially charged comments.

      "Grand Torino is about change. Walt (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran, a retired factory worker and a widower. Walt lives in a Michigan neighborhood that use to be a nice neighborhood. As his old neighbors leave the new neighbors move in and they come Korea and other places. The houses aren't kept up like they use to. The attitude of the new neighbors are the opposite of Walt's. Even Walt's own family try to change Walt but they can't. However, there was only one thing that didn't change. It was Walt's pride and joy which was a grand torino car that he helped build in 1972.Throughout the movie change did happen. Walt didn't like his next door neighbors, Thao (Bee VAng), Sue (Ahney Her) and family, because they were from Korea. Walt didn't like Koreans because he fought against during the war. Thao tries to steal Walt's grand torino and Walt catches him in the act. At first, Walt was mad with Thao but eventually works with Thao by teaching him how to repair things, help Thao get a job and even taught Thao how to get the attention of a girl. Walt becomes friends with Sue when she is trapped by a group of boys who wasn't letting Sue go past them and Walt rescues her from them. After that Walt learns more about Sue and her family. Walt learns more about himself after Sue's grandfather reads him at a family picnic. Walt changes his attitude toward Thao, Sue and their family. He even changes his attitude toward his own family by a little bit. With the change, Walt becomes a person who wants to look out for others, especially Thao and Sue.If I remember correctly, Clint Eastwood's character in \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" was a person who looked out for people who, at one time, fought against. Both movies were set in two different time periods but the viewer could see how different events can change people.The angle of the camera in Grand Torino showed the viewer the different sides of Walt. The viewer cold see Walt's reaction to different events, such as how he reacted when he saw his grandchildren at their grandmother's funeral. The viewer could see the smile in Walt's face when he found out that Thao had asked a girl out. The viewer can also see how Walt reacts to the change at his doctor's office.Sound effects is very helpful because they help tell the story. The viewer can hear things that are in sight and what's out of sight. The viewer can hear the car stereos in cars as they go by, groceries dropping to the ground, ceiling fans that's broken, gun shots, Walt slamming his fists into the cabinets, beer cans being opened, and a lighter hitting the ground as Walt falls down when he gets shot by a gang. Two examples of the out of sight sounds are birds in the trees and a basement door closing.In closing, Grand Torino shows the viewer how things can change from bad to good, no matter where the viewer lives. 0.09713504088504088\n",

Clint Eastwood is very good of course, but that is pretty much all there is. As the film goes on is loses it touch and drifts away from being a comedy, to end up very cliché-like as I already mentioned. The film is way too long and had it just stayed as a comedy I would rank it higher than 4 of 10.The acting by the young \"Hmong-kid\" is just awful... especially when it heats up in the end, no one can say anything else.So in the end, even though Eastwoods great acting skills this film says nothing to me.

      "---------Spoilers ahead---------I just saw a movie named Gran Torino which I think that was a very interesting movie because it starts with a grumpy old man who doesn't care about anyone and id ends up being of a old man who cares about his neighbors and protects them, and even dies for them. It has a very clear storyline which makes it a very good movie to watch. This movie is a very emotionally harsh movie because there are very sad moments and moments which you start to hunk how can people live like this? The genre of this movie is drama because it has a little bit of comedy and at the same time tragedyThe movie is about an old man who meets some new neighbors. At first he thinks they are the worst neighbors someone could have because they tried to steal his Gran Torino. As the movie progresses he starts realizing that they aren't that bad and he starts seeing that they are actually great. He becomes close to the kid who lives in the next door house and starts believing that he should really follow his dream and do the right choices in life. He starts by convincing the kid that he shouldn't join his brothers' gang and instead stay in the house and guard his family.I think that the actors in general in this movie did a very good job. Walt and Thao I believe did the best acting in the whole movie. One of the actors I think did a not such good job was Sue, Thao's sister, she was very choppy in her acting, it was not fluid enough for it to look natural.I liked the personality of Walt and the personality of Thao because I think that they develop really good and effectively through out the movie. They interlace very well with the storyline. One of the best parts I like about the movie is the end when Walt gives his life so that the gang of Thao's brother gets placed in jail and so that Thao's family feels safe again.I learned from this movie that in order to reach your goals you need to be persistent and don't let other or obstacles take you down, you need to be strong and get back up to continue with your life goals.I think that teenagers, young adults, and adults would enjoy this movie because it relates a lot of different types of actions and scenes that can relate to the public. I would recommend this movie to people who like to watch good cinema because it is a great movie. The MPAA rating for this movie is R but I don't think that it should be that aggressive; it should be PG-13 because it has some violence but not that much.I think that this is a great film and that anyone who can, should go and watch the movie because it is really worth while to watch the movie. It is a very entertaining movie because you feel the comedy that is produced by Walt, even though his character is not supposed to be funny; but at the same time you feel tragedy with all the problems Thao's family is facing due to his brothers gang. I give this movie a 9/10.John White is a freshman which studies in Costa Rica and is taking the film appreciation class in school. He plays basketball. He likes to watch TV shows and watch movies. 0.20783427386105963\n",
      "It's a masterpiece, but not perfect, hence the 9/10. Only problem I had was the slightly bad acting of some gang members and generally the portrayal of the gangs, but that can be easily overlooked. It will definitely not ruin this movie.On the plus side the movie has that warm gentle feel of Clint Eastwood's directing, beautiful cinematography and a perfect mix of emotions. I consider myself a cynical bastard, quite cold in many ways, but by the time the ending credits started rolling, I found myself moved to tears. This was also due to Clint personally singing the Gran Torino song in the end, and listening to his gruff yet soft echoing voice made me wonder if this was actually his farewell to us all.Thank you Clint. 0.06712962962962964\n",
      "In the movie Gran Torino Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) once again demonstrated that staying calm can be more intimidating than going crazy. I have to mention that I hesitated watching this film because I am not a huge Clint Eastwood fan although I have watched many of his films. However, I have to say this film keep me very entertained. I was laughing, crying and celebrating at different times of the movie.The theme of Gran Torino is about moral character and the ability to change. Walt has stereotyped generations below him as useless and lazy. Being a veteran of the Korean War Walt is also very prejudice against other races, especially foreigners. At the beginning of the movie Walt has lost his wife and seems to have nothing to live for anymore. On her death bed the priest, Father Janovich, promises to get Walt into the confessional. Walt will have nothing to do with Father Janovich or the church. He said he only attended because of his wife. Walt lived in a neighborhood of immigrants. His next door neighbor's being Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) and Sue Lor (Ahney Her) which are Mong.Throughout the movie you see a distinct change in Walt going from a grumpy man to someone who appreciated the kindness of Thao, Sue, and their family. The changes begin when Thao has to work off his disgrace to his family for attempting to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt begrudgingly allows him to work for him starting him off by counting birds because he feels he is worthless. Over time Walt teaches him how to fix things and has him fixing up people's homes all over the neighborhood. After Thao's time is up with Walt he continues to hang around getting more lessons on how to become a man. Walt takes Thao under his wing and even gets him a job trying to keep him out of the gangs.Before he even opens himself up to Thao he first agrees to come to dinner at Sue and Thao's home. He saves the family from a gang which has Thao and Sue's cousin in it and Sue invites him over to share a meal with them. Sue befriends Walt talking to him about their culture and way of thinking. Walt becomes protective of Sue and comes to her rescue when she is on a date and three colored teenage boys are harassing her.In the end Sue and Thao were more like family than Walt's own children and grandchildren. He grew to love them and gave his life to saves theirs. This selfless act goes to show that your heart can change about anything and anyone.The sound effects in this movie were very important to the overall picture. The gunshots, the windows breaking, car wheels screeching where all important to the things you could see on the screen and the things you could not see. The crashing of the glass as Walt put his hand through the glass cabinets made you cringe in pain for him. Without the sound effects the movie would not have the same impact on the viewer. The other important thing was lighting. When something big was about to happen the lighting went low. When Walt was in his house it was always dark and dreary but when at Thao and Sue's house it was always bright and full of life.It just goes to show with forgiveness, understanding, and tolerance all generations can learn from each other and make a change for the better. 0.1177582644628099\n",
      "The movie is structured as a delicate metaphor; the old car symbolizes the old man from various perspectives. Even though the car is kept in garage and cannot be used as anymore as an advanced, stylish vehicle, the prized possession still stands for the past glory and all the pride. In the last scene of the movie, Tao drives the Gran Torino bestowed by Walt and vanishes in the distance, which simply implies that when someone is getting old and is gradually stepping out of the dominant social life, he could still play a crucial role and drive the weak and the young on a reliable weaker into peace and safety.The movie Gran Torino helps you delve into the inner world of seniors. As they become marginalized and sometimes are not treated with equality, they appear to be tough-minded but actually call for people's care and understanding at the bottom of hearts, at the same time, hope to contribute more to the community they live in and realize their value as a social being. 0.05390151515151516\n",

The writing was terrible, it was the \"writers\" first \"real script\" and didn't know anything about pacing and should quit writing. You will like this movie if you grew up in a middle America setting, with no ethnic diversity at all. This is the \"redneck/ war vet drama\" for the average American.(Or the redneck deer hunter(dumbed down, racist and has muscle cars)) Clint portrayed the closed minded, beer drinking, chain smoking vet, pretty well, but am not sure if he was acting, or just doing what he does. He tries to counterbalance the racism by adding the \"wigger\" character, but is ineffective and is just making fun of white people. This guy is getting too old and cant direct, and is taking on more than he can handle and it is showing.

      "Although set in modern Detroit, this film is another great Western-style movie that Eastwood can add to his resume.While some may find the racial slurs and stereotypes insulting, these add an element to Eastwood's hardened vigilante character. He plays a Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski who is isolated from his family, has no close friends, dislikes his Hmong neighbors, and prefers to keep to himself. His dislike for his immigrant neighbors intensifies during the first part of the movie, but eventually Walt warms up to the Hmong neighbor kids, a teenage brother and sister.Like any good Western, the film is set on the frontier--this time the urban frontier, where \"the law\" and \"civilization\" have little to no effect. Walt is one of the few remaining Americans in one of Detroit's once-\"civilized\" suburbs. Gangs have taken over the area, however, and Walt's neighborhood is now largely Hmong--a small, close-knit Asian ethnic group who are very private. The police have no control over the area, so it's up to the families to protect themselves from the rampant gang violence. At one point, Walt pulls out his old rifle from his service during the Korean War to chase the Hmong gang off his property and prevent them from kidnapping the teenage neighbor boy, Thao, and claiming the boy as one of their members. The local priest chides Walt for not calling the police, to which Walt has no reply.The gang violence against the Hmong neighbors escalates to the point where the local Hmong gang terrorizes the neighbor family by shooting at their house and beating and raping the teenage sister. Again, the police are powerless to do anything about these crimes, so there is nothing to stop the gang from ruling the neighborhood through the use of violence.At this point, Walt must step up to protect the teenage children. The only way to do so is to make sure the gang \"goes away for good.\" He formulates a plan to go over to the house where the gang members live, seemingly to kill them all in vengeance; he spends the day cleaning his gun, getting a military-style shave, buying a new custom-fitted suit, and going to confession--all things he has either never done or has not done in decades. At the showdown in front of the house--the classic saloon gunfight scene, except in a rundown suburb--Walt seemingly reaches for his gun as the entire house full of gang members cock their guns and open fire. It turns out Walt was merely reaching for his cigarette lighter and had actually come to the house unarmed.In a twist on the classic Western plot, Walt--the Western hero--used the gang's violence against them. In going to their house unarmed and allowing the gang to shoot him in front of several witnesses, Walt ensured that the gang would go to jail \"for a very long time,\" effectively protecting the teenage neighbors from further violent acts through his martyrdom. The \"law\" that had been absent throughout the movie up to this point ends up saving the day by putting the gang members away for good. Ultimately, without an effective legal justice system, Walt's martyrdom would have been useless.Overall, the basic concept is that vigilante justice must come before the legal system can operate effectively. However, vigilante justice must yield before civilization and \"the law\" can arrive. 0.08074208471267294\n",

      "Before I write this review I want to let everyone know I have an extreme bias for Clint Eastwood. I love his movies and I believe him to be one of the greatest actors of our time. That being said Gran Torino's overriding theme is how the human spirit sometimes has trouble dealing with change. The movie takes place in Highland Park, Michigan. The neighborhood used to be populated by middle class white families. The neighborhood has now falling into despair and is mostly populated by poor Asian families. The main character Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just lost his wife. He is a Korean War veteran that is having a hard time changing with the world around him. Walt can not relate to his son or his grandchildren. Walt feels that his neighborhood filled with a bunch of foreigners. One night Walt notices a light in his garage. Walt grabs his M-1 rifle and confronts his neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) as he is trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino. Walt lets Thao go and does not call the police. A few nights later a fight spills over into Walt's yard. It is Thao being confronted by the very gang that tried to make him steal the Grand Torino. Walt comes out of his house and runs the gang off with his M-1 rifle. The neighborhood sees Walt as a hero but in Walt's mind he would have never gotten involved if it would not have spilled over to his property. Thao's family makes him help a reluctant Walt work on the very car he tried to steal. As time goes on Walt begins to make a bound with Thao and decides to take him under his wing. As the movie moves along Walt finds out that he is terminally ill with cancer. The gang that tried to make Thao steal the car is becoming more violent towards Thao and his family. Walt decides to make a final stand against the gang in order to free Thao and his family from further persecution. Clint Eastwood uses a lot of close up shots that are shot from down low looking up. I think this does a great job in showing the characters emotions. Eastwood seems to do this a lot more with Walt's character. I believe he does this to make Walt look proud and almost heroic.The theme to Gran Torino reminds me in many ways of an earlier Eastwood film Pale Rider. In Pale rider Eastwood is a loner that protects a family from violence and is willing to give his life in order to protect them In the end Walt finally comes to grips with the world around him. He comes to realize that there are still good people in the world although they look much different than Walt thought they would. Thao and his family have given Walt a great gift and I believe that he dies a happy man as he is given a purpose to live again. 0.17234437397228095\n",
      "This was a spectacular movie. I watched it tonight, and I wasn't ready for it. The characters were cast perfectly, and the filming locations were good. The Score was great too, but not the best i've heard. There are a few funny moments throughout the movie, but they pale in comparison to the deeper parts of this movie. Clint and the others did a fantastic job writing and directing the movie. It touched on a few social subjects, such as gang violence, racism, and different cultures. At first, I hated Clint's character, as the way he interacted with others was harsh. But the way he turned out to be in the end was amazing. I consider myself to be a pretty tough guy, but the ending literally sent shivers down my spine. The characters were very well developed, and I felt like I knew them by the end of the film. Overall, I definitely give this movie a 10/10, and you should definitely watch it if you haven't already. 0.1588034188034188\n",

A gang try to initiate the young son of the neighbors, to seal the ford car Grand Torio of Clint. But he fail. Then the gang of young Koreans come to annoy the son of the neighbors. Hearing the fight Clint goes out with a gun and make the gang to run. The neighbors full of gratitude bring food and flowers, offerings, for their new Savior. Clint don't accept. Then the son of the neighbor come to apology to Clint and tell Clint he will help him fix things, help him. Clint is not happy but accept the deal. Then Clint feel closer to the family and the boy. After being punished the gang come back and fire on the neighbors house. Then Clint decide to take revenge. He goes in the night to the gang house and light a cigarette.

      "People really should support this movie which has a really big heart. It's too bad that Hollywood won't support a movie where a) the main characters are unknown Asians and b) the hero is a straight racist white military veteran. The movie starts by portraying the old Korean vet as a racist who is angry starting with his own family, and goes downhill from there, and the Asian neighbors as the enemy. The meek boy is the worst example of their people. But in the end, Walt is revealed to be the hero, and the boy becomes his spiritual disciple. As with the story of the good Samaritan, the \"invaders\" become his true family that he loves so much he gives up his own life for them. It's no coincidence that he ends up sprawled on the lawn as if nailed to a cross.As one who has seen many movies portray the story of (sometimes doomed) white men against a romantic backdrop of (sometimes savage) Asians such as Sand Pebbles or Clavell's Shogun, Walt on one level appears to be an unwitting white missionary who, instead of traveling to far off places, is left behind when far-off peoples transform the neighborhood. It also evokes a flip-mirror version of Spike Lee's controversial Do the Right Thing which at one level presents the imperialist Pizza parlor as the enemy and the bomb tossing radical as the hero, but on another revealed the folly of destroying local businesses to make a political point of racial assertiveness.On another level, he is the Western blue-collar mirror image of Kung Fu Kid's sensei or Obi Wan Kenobi who skillfully insults fellow Americans of all races with a signature move of pointing his M-1 Garand rifle into the faces of punks. Meek Thao / Toad is trained in the fine art of BS, asking a girl out, and fixing things. When we see the promo shot of the Gran Torino driving by the water, it's actually the young Jedi carrying on Walt's legacy in his car, with Walt's dog by his side.As an Asian American who has had to find his own way of assimilation, (and still can't cuss quite the way Walt can or shoot) I can empathize with people who find America as exotic and unscrutable as America finds the \"orientals\". The film suffers a bit from casting punks as Latinos (low rider chevy), Asians (giant winged Civic) and whites as posers, redneck (Ford pickup) or successful grown yuppies (Land Cruiser) but the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese as well as the Hmong have suffered from gangs at different times and places in history. Older sister Sue come across a bit mismatched as the interpreter when her brother looks and talks like he just got off the FOB boat. She seems to be on vacation from Asian American studies at Ann Arbor. (The girls go to college, the boys go to jail) The shaman and grumpy grandmother are marvelous even if we have no idea what they are saying. (\"She says welcome to our house\"???) There is just so much going on between the characters, this movie deserves to be watched and torn apart much more the flicks like Catch-22, Cuckoo's Nest or Cool Hand Luke that I watched back in the 70s. On the surface, it looks like Dirty Harry Rides Again. I'm still not impressed by the movie that made him famous (what was with those nude scenes anyways??), but there's much, much more to it than that in this latest effort. BTW, the Gran Torino was one of my favorite muscle cars of the 1970s, and if you are interested in other Asian-themed movies, you should watch Letters from Iwo Jima, it's much better than Flags of Our Fathers. 0.11118697478991596\n",

      "I'm giving this film nine stars only because, as so many other viewers have mentioned, the acting has problems and there are some unrealistic elements to the plot. Those problems should merit another star or two taken off, but in this case, I'm forgiving a lot because I think this is a tremendously meaningful film. It personally showed me that I'm not alone in some of the ways I look at the direction society is taking, so my opinion is biased. I'm going to go into some detail here in how I saw the film because of it.Walt's life shows elements of our country which can be disturbing, the dark side of American culture. Walt has worked hard and invested himself in a home, a family, a job, a war, and a very nice car, the famed Ford Gran Torino that much of this movie revolves around. His attitude is that of a gruff man who has been expected to perform - morally, domestically, militarily, and economically - to work for what is his as a man, in partnership with his now-passed wife. And he did. But in the twilight of his life, he finds himself with spoiled children and grandchildren with an unmistakable sense of entitlement, a family which doesn't respect him and wishes to divide his assets and shovel him off to the retirement home as quickly as they can. The sense of investment into one's community has been abandoned, his neighborhood shows it, and he has been forgotten.In contrast to his family, he comes to know the neighbors, Hmong immigrants with a strong sense of family and tradition. After much hesitation brought about by his surface prejudice, he realizes, and literally says to himself, that he has more in common with the foreigners than he has with his own spoiled-ass family. With the neighborhood in trouble, Walt's strength is called back into demand, and he cares for people as he knows how: Defending them physically and morally, guiding the youth with potential into a responsible life at the cost of his own.The best part of this is at the end, when Walt wills his beloved Gran Torino to the decent immigrant kid instead of his self-absorbed granddaughter. The message is straightforward: The ones who will inherit the best of our society are the ones who show character and respect, the universal ethic of those who invest instead of consume. This kind of message is wonderfully satisfying if you appreciate what the film is trying to do, and out of step with mainstream productions in the best way.Of course, it has its flaws, but its disappointing to see as many critical reviewers here focusing on how unlikable Walt is, or the irreverent, jocular ethnic bantering that barely constitutes genuine racism. Any significant amount of that quickly dies when Walt is exposed to reality: He's actually a better judge of character than most people. Eastwood embodies the role wonderfully. Of course he's a flawed character: The film would have no realism whatsoever if he wasn't. But it's a very idealistic film that starts with the grim outlook and establishes a relevant point of view creatively and meaningfully. It also happens to be funny as hell and well written, so it certainly isn't a chore to watch. Forget minor flaws and enjoy. 0.1999014778325123\n",

      "Grand Torino is an example of a probable all time classic for Clint, due to the fact that his expressions and the way he preforms as an actor is exceptional. The first time i saw this movie i was in awe of how great and how funny his remarks were and the way he talked to his family were to funny to hold in the laughter. Most movies to call out to my attention but for some reasons the trailer for this movie was hilarious. You have to have some guts as an elder man such as Waltz to stand up to all kinds of people no matter how many of them he is up against. But what i didn't like was the bad acting of Thao when he was locked up in the basement before the death of Waltz. i mean i know he had to scream or shout out at Walt but it almost, seemed as if he wasn't even putting any emotion to it, it seemed very dead. Besides that, this movie was phenomenal i will gladly buy this movie once in comes out to DVD. 0.22143518518518515\n",
      "This is yet again a pretty typical Clint Eastwood film. I'd say the only redeeming points were: some of the humour which poked fun at Eastwood's age and the acting of Ashney Her as the young Korean neighbour. Eastwood himself was fine but nothing special as an old angry curmudgeon (it's really not much of a stretch is it?). The problem I have with his films is that they lack any logical conclusion based in reality (particularly true of Million Dollar Baby). Same thing is true here. In the end of course Eastwood sacrifices himself for his new friends. It's completely illogical and is only used as a method for the audience to feel some sympathy for this \"hero\" who lets himself get killed to save his friends. Was this the only real solution besides using violence and killing a bunch of people? Yes, the point is that he suffered for the violence he committed years earlier (that point was not lost on me) but it felt heavy-handed and manipulative for Eastwood to have to die in the end.The movie had a very mixed message about race as well. It seems that the message is that the only way an Asian family in America can thrive and survive in modern America is with the assistance and sacrifice of an old white male war veteran. There's so self-empowerment message here. It's all about relying on 'whitey' to survive in America.Eastwood's Libertarian/conservative views are obvious here. I really can't say much more about what a bad movie this is. One of the most overrated movies of 2008. Very badly acted. Very bad script. How many times must we see a white patriarch sacrifice himself at the end for the benefit of everyone. How utterly crass. 0.04691479252454866\n",
      "Gran Torino centers around its main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a Korean War veteran that is trying to cope with the loss of his wife and his past transgressions. Over time, he sees more Hmong families move into his neighborhood, including the Vang Lor family moving in next door. While initially holding disdain for Thao (Bee Vang), Sue (Ahney Her), and the rest of the Vang Lors, he eventually comes to like them, as he sees he has more in common with them than his own family. When Thao and Sue are pestered by the local gang(s), Walt decides to step in and help.The main theme of this film is people must deal with -- and ideally, overcome -- generational and cultural gaps on a daily basis. In Walt's case, he was a Korean War veteran and a proud American. Not only was there an age gap between him and Thao and Sue, but there was also the cultural gap. In addition, spending years in Korea being shot at by Asians shaped his world view, as he came to dislike all Asians because of it. We see this when the Hmong gang shows up at the Vang Lors house. Walt comes out of his house and points a gun in their faces, as he speaks about how he stacked corpses of people just like them in Korea. At the end of the scene, we see that he wasn't coming to the aid of the Vang Lors, as all he wanted was for them to get off of his property.Throughout the film, we see Walt deal with these gaps, and is mostly able to overcome them. We first see him start to question his views when he sees Thao run across the street and help an old lady with her groceries. This continues when Thao offers to work for Walt to make up for the fact that he tried to steal the Gran Torino. It isn't until Walt spends time with the Hmong people that he realizes not all of them are bad. The only thing that keeps him from completely overcoming these gaps is the fact that he still refers to every Hmong person by a racial slur, as those words were not frowned upon when Walt was younger.The theme of this film reminds me a lot of the film Avatar. In that film, character Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) must infiltrate the Na'vi people on the moon Pandora. As he spends time with the Na'vi, though, he comes to sympathize with them and gets along with them. This is not unlike Gran Torino with Walt eventually sympathizing and getting along with the Hmong people. Despite what the characters in both films were led to believe, Jake and Walt ultimately realized that the Na'vi and Hmong, respectively, are not bad.Gran Torino's theme is represented by multiple film techniques throughout the movie. The first of which is the motif. Walt is a war veteran and a proud American, and because of this he frowns upon anything that is not American. The motif we see is the color used in the film. In several scenes, there is always some representation of the American flag -- red, white, and blue colors -- in the scene with Walt, such as the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer he drinks. This helps further the theme that Walt is a little out of touch with today's society, as he is still overly patriotic, frowning upon anything that isn't American.The angles used for various scenes in the movie are the second film technique that pushes the theme forward. When Walt points his gun at the Hmong gang, the angle used for the scene shows the anger and disgust he feels towards the Hmong. Later in the film, we see similar angles, such as when Walt takes Thao to get a construction job, and the viewers are able to see that his demeanor towards the Hmong has changed. Not only does he now sympathize with them, but he also enjoys their company.All in all, Gran Torino is a good movie with plenty of unintentional -- and certainly racist -- humor. However, the film does suffer a bit from what is, at times, slow pacing. That being said, I believe the slow pacing was deliberate, as the film takes its time to dive deep into the core theme of the film of people having to fight the generational and cultural gaps on a daily basis. We see every side of the theme in the film, as well as a bit of a redemption for the Walt character, as he not only makes peace with his past transgressions, but also comes to tolerate the generational, and especially cultural, gaps that he was faced with. This is a film that I think everyone should watch, as the humor throughout the film helps relieve the tedium of the slow pacing this movie uses. 0.07032450076804915\n",
      "Shamefully the first and only Clint Eastwood movie I have seen in a theatre, \"Gran Torino\" is definitely a highlight in this mans legendary six decade career. Sure his influence to the Western and Police genre are timeless, but this performance pretty much cements how relevant Eastwood still is and how much he still has to offer the medium.And so again with another tough guy persona, Clint plays Walt Kowalski. If there was anyone who can play the \"There goes the neighbourhood\" guy without overworking it, it's him. An angry Korean war veteran, whose only remaining happiness is his pristine Ford Gran Torino. His no bull attitude eventually makes him a hero to his working class Asian immigrant neighbours, and Walt inevitably comes to enjoy their company. A few undesirables leaves Walt to eventually take matters into his own hands, protecting the neighbourhood who have grown to love him in one of cinemas most recent touching endings.The casting is arguable considering it features a lot of first timers, yet Clint has managed to choose his actors to fit there roles naturally and none of it ever comes off faked. Success is also risky when your starring and directing the movie, yet Eastwood's camera work is unflinching in depicting a local suburbia falling apart. The man still has the acting chops to hold up a movie, especially in the solo and tense standoff scenes (78 at the time, I still wouldn't mess with him).Final Verdict: A somewhat charming and somewhat down to earth gritty street drama. \"Gran Torino\" isn't trying to say anything given some of the racist undertones, but it's another solid effort from Eastwood definitely worth seeing. 8/10. 0.16571637426900584\n",

      "Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) depicts an old Korean War veteran, who deals with new changes invading his life. In the film \"Gran Torino,\" which was produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, Walt risks his own health to aid his neighborhood in its time of need. The family next door claims his actions were heroic when Walt helped one of their own. A shy boy named Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue Lor (Ahney Her) were in the midst of an attack from their troubled cousins. Walt heard the commotion and marched out with his rifle ridding their yard and his of their Hmong cousins. The theme of risking a human life to save the lives of many was evident in different parts of the film. Not only in the beginning stages of the film, but also in the end where Walt finally puts an end to the madness of the gangs in the neighborhood. By devising a plan to draw the gang members out of their poorly kept home, he was able to have witnesses see the gunfire shot at him in the gang's front lawn. Although the terrible cousins of Thao and Sue thought Walt was carrying weapons on him, he was just equipped with his lighter. Saving the whole neighborhood, he was left dead.Walt Kowalski managed to get along better with his neighbors rather than his own sons and family. Thao, the Hmong kid from next door, was working for Walt and had thought of Walt now as a role model. Walt's newly loved neighbors grown to like him and he begins to notice how things are not the same around this neighborhood. Involving himself in the newly integrated neighborhood, he assists Thao and his families by first helping Thao get a job and a girlfriend, in hoping he will become the man of the house. Secondly, his goal was to soon give Thao his 1972 Gran Torino and help him and his sister stray away from their troubled cousins. I think by Walt taking Thao and his family under his wing, he carved a great future for them.I have a great interest in people adjusting to change and helping others, such as Walt in \"Gran Torino.\" The rewarding experiences that Walt brought this family and neighborhood are astounding. He realized his time living after the war was coming to an end. Knowing the lives of the teens and the people in the neighborhood having so much to look forward too; he set out to make an abrupt stop to the neighborhood gang. In addition, it was special to watch the process of the neighborhood changing because of Walt Kowalski. 0.1580228981544771\n",
      "Clint Eastwood's character in Gran Torino is one of the less likable good guys recently seen on screen. Recently widowed, retired automobile worker Walt Kowalski is a lonely man, non-communicative neighbor, non-committal Catholic, badly mouthed and with a tendency of racism towards the Asian neighbors who came in numbers to settle his neighborhood. His sense of justice is initially focused towards keeping any other human beings' feet out of his lawn. This until events in the neighborhood will force him take a stand and get him to know the true human face of his neighbors.The theme of the WASP American confronted with the newcomers in the increasingly multi-racial and multi-cultural society of today's America is the same as in the wonderful 'The Visitor' that I saw a few months ago. Yet, everything that was there subtle, unexpected, hinted, is here in 'Gran Torino' direct and trivial. Eastwood's Kowalski acts as and old incarnation of his cowboy roles three or four decades earlier. His understanding of the neighbors is never in harmony with their culture for which he keeps a permanent disdain, it is always in his own terms. The cultural integration is not perceived as a bilateral and respectful process, but as a series of lessons in 'the American way', meaning rude language and macho behavior. At least the screen story has the wisdom of showing this way as failing in real life. The final resolution of the conflict has a very moralistic tone, with a Christian symbolic nuance that may work on the screen but in real life would be less credible (there is probably more than one gang in that suburb area, right?).Clint Eastwood is a living legend, and at his age and stature he can do whatever he wants on screen. He does it his way. To my taste, when dealing with the tough problems of inter-racial relations and social problems in the American suburbs his ways do not work too well. It's maybe because the cowboys ways do not work that well in these situations. 0.07323848238482387\n",

      "We just finished watching \"Gran Torino\" in our film appreciation class and were asked to create a critique about it. This, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have ever seen because it presents a topic that is not commonly presented in movies. \"Gran Torino\" is a movie produced, and directed by Clint Eastwood, so we can tell that it has his characteristic of adding a classic element to the film. This movie shows us the life of a Korean War veteran, Walt Kowalski, who is already retired and lives in a Hmong neighborhood. Throughout the movie we learn a lot about Walt and how he manages to change in order to help those around him.The movie is about Walt Kowalski, and old, grumpy, conservative, and racist man who lives in a Hmong, middle class neighborhood that has been deteriorated with the passing of time. The main conflict present in this movie is the struggle to overcome racism and to see people as they really are in order to be able to help them. The main characters in this movie are Walt, Thao (his neighbor), Sue, Father Janovich, and Spider. In the movie we can see how Walt meets Thao, a young Hmong teen, who was constantly harassed by his cousin, Spider, and his gang. Thao tries to steal Walt's most prized possession, his 1972 Gran Torino, but gets caught and has to work off his debt. While doing this, Walt puts aside his racist views and his anger and becomes at peace by helping this young man.The two actors that did a better job than the rest were Clint Eastwood and Christopher Carley. Clint Eastwood played the role of Walt Kowalski, while Carley played the role of Father Janovich. These two actors managed to perform a better job than the rest mostly because they were more experienced and they had a large acting background. In my opinion the ones who acted the worst were Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who played Thao and Sue. These two acted the worst because they were inexperienced actors who lacked proper acting skills; meaning that \"Gran Torino\" was there first appearance in an audiovisual production.What I liked most about this movie was probably the acting of Clint Eastwood, because he captures the essence of the character he is playing and gives it all he has to create a believable man with who the audience can relate to. Even though he is full of irreverent, pure, racism, he manages to show it in a tasteful way that only Clint Eastwood could've done. My favorite scene in the whole movie was the ending scene, where Walt shows up to Spider's house to stand up for Thao. Here, he tricks Spider's gang into believing that he had a gun, which led them to shoot and kill Walt. Because of this, the police finally had a concrete reason to put them away in jail for good. In the end, Walt put others in front of himself and acted in a heroic, unselfish way to bring peace to Thao's family, so you could say that Walt sacrificed his life for the well being of Sue and Thao. The only thing that I really didn't like about this movie was the acting of Thao and Sue. It didn't affect the movie that much, except when the scene was focused on them. For example, when Thao is locked up in Walt's basement and he screams out for help, his acting is very poor and takes us out of the plot for a second; its shocking that such an amazing film was stained by the acting of \"rookie\" actors.The theme this movie portrays is that good will and the good in people is strong enough to put aside horrible things, such as racism, and allows others to see a person for how he/she really is. This is clearly shown through Walt's life, since he at the beginning was strongly racist and hated people from other races, but towards the end he realizes that they are also humans and that the Hmong have more in common with him than his own sons. I think others might learn a similar theme than me because this theme is very universal, but of course everyone can interpret the theme of this story differently. The genre of this movie is a mixture between suspense and drama, mostly because it keeps us wondering what is going to happen next and it connects us emotionally to Walt Kowalski. This movie shares a similar idea to one of his previous movies, \"Million Dollar Baby\", since the main character helps a low class person with very little recourses to make him/herself successful and gives him/her a chance to reach their goal, while opening his heart to them.This movie was directed mostly towards people of the third age, since they might be able to relate to Walt and to some situations he finds himself in, like the realization of their own mortality. I personally would recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 15 because this movie does show some strong scenes and messages. The official MPAA rating of the movie is R because of strong language and violence. My final word about this movie would be that it is a great movie that will be remembered for a long time, or at least by me. It is worth spending your time to see and you wont know that 116 minutes have passed. I give it 5 stars out of 5.Stefan Engler is a 10th grader in Lincoln School, Costa Rica who likes to play sports and enjoys watching good movies.

      "This movie is a beautiful film, with great actors and great cinematography. You can hate Clint eastward or love him, doesn't matter because this film is a great movie by itself. Clint Eastwood is great but this film stands alone as one of the best. Clint Eastwood is a wonderful director and producer. This movie is for everyone, it will make you cheer and also reflect but at most it makes you appreciate Clint Eastwood's work.Gran Torino is a movie of why a role model or a father figure can mean so much. Why learning from your past can haunt you or help you. That everyone can be friends Evan if their past don't go so great. That a man should always stand up for what is right and always defend the people they keep closest. Gran Torino is hands down one of the best films I have seen. 0.4204254850088183\n",

My best friend told me it was not worth going to see but I thought it can't be that bad. Well it is. The Hmong actors were generally very bad. It was uncomfortable to watch. Clint had the growl down but not much else. The movie was fairly predictable, exactly what you would expect from a movie of this sort. Although the ending was unexpected the torture of watching the entire movie just to see the ending certainly was not worth it. Why this movie has such a high rating is beyond me.

I've realized how it will end that exact moment when Walt started to think about revenge.. they should involve his cancer thing somewhere else in the story just to cover the trace, because it was too important to be left out of the picture, and in the end it was the most predictable way of using it.. Also, except Clint and the priest, all the other main actors could make much better job. but on the other hand, I liked that barber shop keeper. anyway, it's really nice movie. after Clint left all these westerns behind, most of his later movies is a peace of art. 0.2392156862745098\n",
      "This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do.

      "First and foremost: The acting was absolutely terrible. The Asian girl ruined the whole film. I thought her brother did a much better job than she. Also, just because Clint Eastwood is in this movie it doesn't mean it's wonderful. He is an amazing actor and director, but God help him with this one. Please do not waste your hard earned money going to the movies for Grand Torino. This is more of a \"wait until it comes out on video\" kind of movie. Do not listen to any of these fruit loops who praise Grand Torino. I don't know about most people, but I like quality, entertainment value in a film. This didn't have any of it. Instead it was Clint Eastwood being a cranky, potty mouth of an old man (I'm a potty mouth too lol) who was complaining about all the \"thugs\" in the neighborhood and how kids just don't have manners these days.

Yet the person that wrote the comment on the home page of Gran Torino did add a spoiler to the movie if they read the full comment. It mention that he dies and I believe that would ruin the movie for someone who had never seen it.

      "Two-time Oscar winning director Clint Eastwood of \"Million Dollar Baby\" directs and stars in \"Gran Torino,\" another top-drawer drama that appears to have been tailor-made for his talents and personality. Three-fourths of \"Gran Torino\" is as entertaining and amusing as any \"All in the Family\" episode except that the bigoted hero indulges in profanity and racism galore. Mind you, this is an R-rated movie. The last quarter hour turns pretty grim and tragic, like John Wayne's final western \"The Shootist\" (1976) as the hero asserts his beliefs in the face of insurmountable odds. Die-hard Clint fans will gobble up the first three-fourths of \"Gran Torino,\" while the last fourth will surprise but sadden them. People that thought the ending to \"Unforgiven\" seemed unrealistic will probably applaud the \"Gran Torino\" finale. Ironically, despite his animosity toward his Asian neighbors, our hero mellows over the course of the film's 116 minutes, and the Asians become more like family to him than his own blood relatives.\"Gran Torino\" qualifies as a first-rate character study about 78-year old, retired Ford assembly plant worker Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood of \"Heartbreak Ridge\"), who served his country patriotically in the Korean War and whose wife has just died. Left alone to fend for himself, Walt whiles away his days sitting on his front porch and guzzles one beer after another with his docile yellow Labrador named Daisy curled up contentedly at his feet. Walt mows his lawn with an old push mower and watches with disgust as the large population of mountain peoplethe Hmong--from Southeast Asia gradually take over his Detroit suburb. Indeed, Walt doesn't care for their kind, and they have no love lost for him. Walt's next door neighbors, an elderly grandmother (newcomer Chee Thao), her daughter with her own daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and her introverted son Thao (Bee Vang)living with her try to steer clear of Walt.The teenaged Thao, who lives next door, doesn't have a job. One day a carload of Hispanic gangbangers give him grief as he is walking along a sidewalk minding his own business. Thao's own kind, another carload of just as unsavory young gangbangers, cruise to his rescue, and warn the Hispanics to watch out. These Asian gangbangers want to take Thao in as their latest gang member, and Thao decides to join them. If he can steal the vintage Ford Gran Torino that Walt has parked in his garage, the gangbangers will induct him as one of their own.Predictably, Thao bungles the theft and his fellow gangbangers show up to take it out of his hide. While they are using him as a human punching bag, they make the mistake of trespassing on Walt's lawn. Walt marches out to meet them with 9.5 pound American M-1 Garand, .30-06 gas operated rifle anchored against his shoulder with its sights trained on them. \"Get off my lawn,\" he growls with menace, and everybody retreats. The gangbangers resent Walt's intrusion and give him dirty looks. \"We used to stack you up five deep like sandbags in Korea,\" he adds with his finger on the trigger. Reluctantly, these hard cases back off. After the incident, the entire Asian community visits Walt's house and stack tributes of flowers and food on his front steps as if they were visiting a shrine. Naturally, Walt doesn't understand any of this adulation.Sue visits Walt on his porch one day as he runs out of beer and invites him over for a drink. Walt meets the family and the tension between these neighbors gradually abates, enough so that Thao's mother and Sue force Thao to work off his attempted theft of Walt's car by performing odd jobs for him. Walt takes a shine to Thao, and they bond. Eventually, Walt becomes Thao mentor. He shows him how to become responsible, win the girl of his dreams, and obtain a job as a construction worker. Inevitably, the Asian gangbangers come back to haunt both Thao and Walt, but wily old Walt proves that old guys can be tough guys right up to the end.Despite his age and wrinkles, Clint can still snarl with the best of them, and he looks every bit as lethal here as he did when he played Inspector Callahan in \"Dirty Harry\" back in 1971. The big difference is Walt wields an M-1 rifle rather than a Model 29 Smith & Wesson. The eponymous car is one that Walt helped build and he maintains in mint condition in his garage. As much as it is a character study, \"Gran Torino\" also shows how people from different races can see eye-to-eye with each other more than they can with their own kind. Walt admits that he never understood his two sons, and he has little respect for a young Catholic priest Father Janovich(Christopher Carley of \"Garden State\") who he thinks is still wet behind the ears.Altogether, \"Gran Torino\" ranks as a terrific Clint Eastwood epic until three-fourths of the way through when everything changes as Walt takes on the neighborhood gangbangers. Some of the best scenes involve Walt rescuing Sue from a trio of black thugs that scared off her white boyfriend and Walt teaching Thao how to talk like a man in a barbershop scene with Martin (John Carroll Lynch of \"Zodiac\"), a cantankerous Italian barber. \"Gran Torino\" unfolds at a leisurely pace, sketches in its plot and characters with affection, but never wears out its welcome. 0.10095598845598842\n",
      "Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood. For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetualy clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always charitably described his early characters as \"laconic\"). Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural. In \"Gran Turino,\" Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films. Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a septuagenarian who is practically the walking definition of a grumpy old man. A Korean War vet still haunted by the memories of what he saw and did there, Walt is a prickly, snarling, irreligious cynic who doesn't much cotton to the informality and lax standards of the modern world. He also happens to be the most \"lovable\" bigot to come our way since Archie Bunker, a thoroughgoing racist who doesn't hesitate to spit out every politically incorrect epithet he can lay his hands on when the situation calls for it (although, in all fairness, he doesn't hesitate to refer to himself as a \"Pollack\" from time to time as well). The key thing to understand about Walt, however, is that while he may be filled with venomous hatred for much of his fellow Man, he knows how to cut through a line of BS when he hears it (much to the consternation of his heighborhood priest, who keeps proferring Walt a chance at salvation if he'll just go to confession). Distraught at the loss of his beloved wife, Walt wages a one-man war against the army of immigrants that has \"invaded\" his formerly all-white, lower middle class neighborhood in recent years. Walt is particularly irked by the Asian family who's moved in next door, until he's befriended by the teenage daughter, who slowly and cautiously brings him into their world. Walt, in turn, takes her younger brother under his wing, helping him stand up to the gang members who taunt and threaten him on almost a daily basis.\"Gran Torino\" is fraught with any number of potential pitfalls, all of which are deftly sidestepped by Nick Schenk's screenplay, Eastwood's direction and, most notably, Eastwood's performance in the starring role. The image of an old man single-handedly staring down a bunch of hardcore gangbangers could easily have elicited laughs under other circumstances, but because Eastwood draws upon our cherished memories of his well established image as a tough guy, we are able to suspend our disbelief and accept it all at face value. This is one time when the audience's previous familiarity with and affection for an actor truly pays off in a big way. Moreover, even though we know where the story is going - that this unyielding curmudgeon will eventually be won over and softened by his experience with this alien culture and the people in it - the easygoing tone of the film keeps it from becoming preachy or mawkish. In fact, what strikes one most is just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be, and this is due almost exclusively to Eastwood's sly, often playful performance. With a disarming cynic's grin and a sardonic twinkle in his eye, Eastwood makes a potentially one-note character into a fully fleshed-out human being.For while the other performances in the film are uneven at best, \"Gran Torino\" contains the best work Eastwood has ever done on screen. The movie serves as a valedictory of sorts for a man whose most recent movie triumphs have all taken place on the other side of the camera. This role is like that last walk the hero takes down the middle of main street before heading off into the sunset. It's a bittersweet image befitting one of the genuine cinematic icons of all time. 0.12996794871794873\n",

      "This is a very good low budget film and apparently the last we will see of Clint in an acting role ( he may have said that b4 though ). The idea behind the film is to show how people can change and that xenophobic views can be broken down with a bit of communication. The performance from Clint is not bad and quirky, many of the other cast are slightly wooden but they are also first timers in the acting business. The story is a good one and there is plenty of dry humour that made me laugh on many occasions. The film warmed my heart and i am glad i didn't miss it, I have watched it on a few occasions now also. Please be aware that there is an element of racist comment although it is not overly offensive people may feel uncomfortable. Without this element however the film would be lost, it is there to tell the story and attitude of the character, It is not there to insult any particular race. Other than that watch and enjoy.

      "\"Gran Torino\" is a 2008 drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring him and Bee Vang. Not many people have managed to stay relevant in Hollywood for more than fifty years and be known to several different generations like Clint Eastwood did. The legend is the prime example of seemingly never-ending fame, as he established himself as an actor at an early age and discovered his talent as a not less brilliant director in the sere and yellow as well. While I can't really call myself a fan of his acting roles of the beginning of his career (I haven't seen enough titles to judge that), I certainly consider myself an admirer of his later work and especially his directorial features. From merciless western \"Unforgiven\" over heartbreaking sports drama \"Million Dollar Baby\" to this 2008 feature I love all of them, and the last two received perfect scores as I have watched them early in January 2018. Since it has been more than two years since I watched them both and my taste in films has changed a lot since then, I decided to finally revisit them and see if they still live up to their perfect rating. In the case of this one, I can say beforehand, it definitely still does. What Eastwood has created with this movie is nothing short of masterfully breathtaking drama. In the focus of the film is his character Walt Kowalski, a grumpy old racist who seems to be annoyed by everyone and everything, especially after his wife has passed away. The only relatives he has left are his grown-up sons and their own families, the thing is that the relationship between them is rather estranged and dysfunctional than happy and healthy. Hence, he is a loner who is only accompanied by his dog Daisy and a lot of alcohol. The fact that he is a total racist and probably knows more racial slurs than common words should not make him any more congenial, but surprisingly, it is still impossible to hate him completely, as the tough cookie still shows a lot of vulnerability at times that gives him a lot of sympathy to him. What I am trying to say is that the way the film establishes its original and tremendously authentic characters is without a doubt one of its biggest strengths, because how is it plausible to still like a racist character? The answer is the background. It is often mentioned that Walt served in the Korean War and that it is the burnt in enemy image that created his basic scorn for Asian people, especially for his Hmong neighbours, but one of the most outstanding things this film depicts that it is possible that a stubborn old man like him with an obviously outdated world view allows himself to learn and over the course of the film discover a new form of sympathy he never felt before. It is one of the most outstanding character developments I have ever seen in a motion picture. Seriously. As he accidentally saves the Hmong family next door from being killed, he becomes a hero against his own will and that is where his transformation begins. The more he gets to know about the foreign culture, the people and their habits and realizes that he actually has a lot in common with them, the more he overcomes his stereotypical thinking. Even when he sometimes makes a prejudice induced comment, it is not tolerated just like this, because his opposite knows how to deal with his quirks and actually offending behaviour. While it is Thao who affronts him in the second half of the film, it is teenage girl Sue who defies him with her sassy but extremely smart clap backs and thus earns his respect in the process. It is palpable that he more and more takes them into his heart and accepts that all his previous prejudices turn out to be wrong. Why else would he take the boy under his wings who almost stole his car, the titular Gran Torino, and who he almost killed after he has caught him while attempting that? He and Thao more and more from and unlikely teacher-and-student bond and even friendship in the process and he even worries about him and Sue and wants to enable that both of them have a bright future and don't end up on the street of the ghetto they live in, like most of the people from that area do. The man who hated everyone and everything that is related to the Asian culture suddenly learns a lot about compassion and benevolence, they even sort of become the family he wished he had. It is even getting to the point that he realizes that the local gang is the only reason why his new friends will never have the future he wants them to have. As things escalate heavily, he knows the only solution and as the viewer I thought he would take it in his own hands and kill everyone who stands in his way, but what happened then is what I consider to be one of the greatest moments in the history of drama. Instead of the bloody massacre everyone probably expected, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and makes sure that he gets killed without carrying a weapon himself. Who does he manage to do that? In this extremely intelligent scene that was sort of foreshadowed before, he pretends to draw his gun, only to reveal that he was reaching for his lighter. Thus, every member of the criminal gang is charged for murder of an unarmed man, what allows the neighbourhood to become safe for a very long time. I am not ashamed to admit that this scene once again made me cry, because this selfless act is not just beautiful but also indescribably breathtaking. The antihero who almost shot everyone with his rifle in the beginning ends up sacrificing himself so that the same people will live in peace after all. If you can tell me a better redemption story and character conversion, go ahead and make my day. On top of that, there is also the fact that it is implied that he is suffering from a fatal disease and instead of taking it to the grave he is using it for a pure act of charity. I think this is just the final statement of the life and death metaphoric that is constantly conveyed throughout the film, mostly through the conversations between Walt and Father Janovich. He has killed dozens of people in the past and was only honoured for murder, so to make peace with himself, he settles the score by sacrificing himself in order to ensure the future of his loved ones and thus will be remembered for giving life. He settled his affairs and uses it for something selfless. If that doesn't make me cry, I don't know what does. What underlines this feeling even more is Eastwood's powerful and versatile performance and the tremendously intelligently written dialogues. The fact that the film ends with the reading of the will in which he gives everything he has ever owned (including the precious car) to the ones who really cared for him instead of his own flesh and blood rounds it all up perfectly. It is never to late to learn and make amends and this film shows it in a masterful way. All in all, this drama remains one of my favourite dramas and still holds up to its original perfect score. In all its facets, this film is perfect to me, as it includes a perfectly build up story and character development, a powerhouse performance of its lead actor, extremely intelligent dialogue and authentic characters. This film undoubtedly has got a lot of heart and doesn't fail to tantalise my emotions. It is amazingly original, brutally realistic and touching and most importantly, beautifully heartbreaking. Some people might not agree, but this film is pure perfection to me and deservedly ranks up extremely high in the list of my all-time favourites. Clint Eastwood is an absolute legend and this film is the proof why. 0.18955091326801857\n",
      "Gran Torino. Disgruntled Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski played by director-actor the old school champion Client Eastwood sets out to reform his neighbor, a Hmong teenager who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: a 1972 Gran Torino. The plot is simple, narrative is straight, drama is deep, emotions are heavy, dialogs are witty and message is huge. All in all, from the word go, you are glued to last days of Walt and how he bonds with his Hmong neighbors and how it affects him and others. Clint Eastwood never misses a beat playing the on your face last man standing. His interactions with ladies around him are much funnier and deep than his main ally the Hmong teenager. The only false note in this class act is the ending of his interaction with young priest who is awaiting for Walt's confession for so long. Nevertheless, the out of the box climax leaves you so much to think about what you will do in similar situation. So watch it because it is witty, funny, emotional and quite a manly movie. 0.0893939393939394\n",
      "Alright, well I don't usually write reviews for movies, but after watching 'Gran Torino' I felt compelled to run to the roof tops and tell the world about the bullshit that I had just witnessed.So there I was, flicking through cable TV, I had just finished watching Futurama and was in a pretty good mood. You know those moods where you think nothing can bring you down, because you're having a hell of a day? Yeah well I was in one of those moods. I clicked on the 'movies' option and quickly went through three pages with nothing good on, when suddenly there it was, 'Gran Torino'.I had heard of this movie, I had no idea what it was about though, but I was pretty sure it was a gangster/mafia type thing, the thought alone of watching a 'Godfather' type movie rocked my socks off and I quickly pressed 'select' without hesitation, (see I don't like reading the information section of the movie, it usually ruins it for me, so I just went right ahead hoping, no, expecting the best).First thing I saw as soon as I selected the channel was a grumpy, old Clint Eastwood at a funeral, my first reaction was \"YES! Clint Eastwood! This is going to be AWESOME!\". Oh how wrong I was... As time went by (painfully slowly) I realised this wasn't a gangster movie, my hopes went up a bit when some Mexican and Asian gangs almost had a show down, but that quickly passed, shooting down my hopes and dreams.Next thing I new I was watching some crap about racism... Yuck... I could already sense that this movie had a moral to it. I hate movies with morals to them.Anyway for about an hour or so this douchey Asian kid kept doing douchey things and Eastwood kept talking about the war in Korea. Which I do believe was a POLICE ACTION, so get off your high horse man, it's not like you were in Vietnam or any REAL WAR.And the camera would zoom up into Eastwoods sagging, wrinkly face every 5 minutes whilst he made a growling sound. That's right, he actually made growling sounds... I think that is actually what ruined it for me, the growling noises! Who the hell actually growls when they're angry? that's some of the worst acting I have EVER seen, I really wasn't expecting this from Clint Eastwood... I may as well have been watching 'Neighbours' or 'The Bold and the Beautiful' if I wanted to see acting of similar quality.So yeah, I got bored, changed the channel and watched 'The Life Aquatic' to try and cheer me up after this horrible movie. I didn't even have to watch the rest to guess that the old grumpy asshole would realize that everybodys equal.So yeah, all in all, don't bother.

      "This is not a perfectly executed film but it is not diminished by its many faults. There are so many continuity errors you'd think it would distract from the tale. They don't. The story is a powerful one. Acting is also uneven yet that too doesn't detract. Amazingly, this is a very compelling film. Even when you can guess the outcome you'll still shed a tear or two at the end. The real story is mostly in the silences - the lost wife, the watching by the shaman, the aborted telephone call....this is what you watch.

      "Clint Eastwood is one of the most brilliant storytellers ever. Gran Torino is just another gem that, regardless of what the Academy, the Politically Correct society and pundits say, is STILL one of the most intriguing movies of redemption ever made.Walt is a retired bigoted, racist Ford factory Assembly Line worker, Korean War Vet and Family Man that finds that he is now on his own after his wife's passing. His family dynamic is non-existent, except when they want something and to make things worse, his Detroit neighborhood is overrun with Hmong Immigrants, including the new Hmong Family next door.The youngest boy, Thao, is forced by his cousin's gang to steal his prized possession, a 1972 Gran Torino that he contributed to assembling on the Ford Assembly Line. Thao gets caught in the act and Walt reacts bitterly and angrily. Over time, he realizes how little of a chance the boy has to avoid a life in a gang and he takes him under his wing, so to speak, to ensure he is on the right path.Throughout the journey he goes on with Thao, he comes to terms with the sins of his past, his bigoted ways and his disdain for people of different color, culture and beliefs. So much so, that the family next door, especially Thao and his sister, that they become more his family than his actual one.The redemption, compassion and atonement Walt goes through over the course of this film is powerful in the fact that it shows that there is always time to make peace with inner demons, look upon others as human beings and understand somebody else from walking in their shoes, so to speak.This is a brilliant movie and should not be missed! The Academy got this one completely wrong as I believe that this is one of Eastwood's finest movies, both acting and directing. Shame on them. 0.10659206864564005\n",

No distinguishing style or photography. An affront to film as an art form. I'm not a big Clint Eastwood fan to begin with, and I don't think I'm the target audience of this, but I much prefer him as an actor than director.

      "The movie Gran Torino is a great movie for both young and adult viewers. I believe that young people can relate to the pressures that are imposed on the young people in the movie and the older viewers can relate to the impacts of getting older. This movie has many themes that come through as watching the movie from start to finish. There were three themes that were obvious throughout the entire movie. Those themes are Respect, Change, and Differences in Ages. The main character, Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood, is an elderly man who is trying to deal with the lack of respect that he feels he receives from his immediate family. He sees this specifically from his grandchildren and children. Walt is having a very difficult time adapting to the changes that have taken place in his Michigan neighborhood. What use to be primarily white neighbors are now mostly Asians. He fought in the Korean War and has many prejudices against many oriental people. Walt is also experiencing the difficulties that many elderly people have when it comes to relating with younger people due to the differences in age and beliefs. Thao, played by Bee Vang, is Walt's neighbor and his family is Hmong. Walt has a lot of negative feelings toward the family because of their nationality and refers to them as \"gucks\". There is a use of irony of situation in this film when you see Walt actually become friends with Thao and try to help him. He becomes friends with what was once his greatest enemy. This unique situation is similar to the movie \"Up\" where the old man is forced to spend time with a young child and builds a loving and respectful relationship. Thao is being pressured to join and gang by his cousin. He is trying to resist but the gang members become violent. Walt befriends Thao after Thao tries to steal his prize possession, a 1972 Gran Torino. The vehicle is so important to him because it symbolizes his life of building quality vehicles and it has always been there to support him when he needed to travel. Thao's sister, Sue, played by Ahney Her, pushes her way into Walt's life by being persistent in making him acknowledge that they are his neighbors and must learn to accept the changes in life. When Walt almost shoots one of the gang members that are trying to take Thao, Thao's mother insists that he work off his appreciation to Walt for saving his life. As Thao is working for Walt, they build a relationship of love and respect for each other. Walt finally realizes that he cares for both Thao and Sue after their persistence to spend time with him. He realizes that he regrets not spending quality time with his children and grandchildren to build a lasting relationship with them. The gang members drive by the house next to Walt's and shoot it up with machine guns. No one in the house was seriously injured. But, the gang tracked down Sue and beat her up and dropped her off at home. Walt realizes as he is sitting in his chair at home that his new friends will not survive if something is not done with the gang. The use of lighting on Walt sitting alone in his chair is dramatic. The room is dark and the only light is that directly on the middle of Walt. It appears that there is a cloudy aura around him. Because of his new found love for Thao, he makes the greatest sacrifice. Walt goes to the home of the gang members and calls them outside. Neighbors are watching as Walt reaches in his pocket to pull out a lighter and the gang pulls their weapons. The sound of the automatic weapons going off repeatedly is deafening. There are multiple shots of the same scene which makes the scene appear to be much longer than it actually is. The gun sounds are continued throughout the entire time. As Walt falls to the ground, we realize that he does not even have a gun. The final scene of the movie shows Thao wearing the medal of valor that Walt received while in the Korean War. He had given this medal to Thao as a symbol of his new earned respect for him. By putting the camera on this medal at the end after Walt has sacrificed his life shows that Walt was willing to take this action for his new friend because he appreciated his relationship with him the way the military appreciated his actions during the war. Throughout the movie, we can see Walt's opinions about other people change. He learns to accept others regardless of their nationality, age or beliefs. 0.11929139883685341\n",
      "'Gran Torino' is probably the best (modern) movie about cars. Yeah, take that you obnoxious and loud 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise. 1972 Ford Gran Torino is one fabulous car that is one of the stars of the movie and also serves as a metaphor for the good old days in Walt Kowalski's (Clint Eastwood) life. 'Gran Torino' is not a genre movie. It is not a crime story or an action film or the revenge tale, and not even proper drama or comedy. It is a simple straightforward movie that just tells the stories of its main characters and doesn't ad any agenda into the mix.

      "I wouldn't know how to start in heaping more and more praise on a movie like this. This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not \"Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist\" but rather \"A crusty old racist playing himself\". No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in \"The Dark Knight\".Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in \"There Will Be Blood\": You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family. 0.16199134199134202\n",

      "And yes, they didn't stand a chance. One of the most unexpected endings and I would say this is the brilliant ending to the wonderful movie. Till the end, it builds up the relation between Walt and the Hmong neighbors and the final decision he has taken to save Tao and Sue from the gangsters that are messing with their lives.When it comes to the movie, it is a simple story. Walt's wife passes away and at the same time, Sue and Tao move next to his place. Tao is being bothered by the gangsters to join their gang and for him to join, Tao has to steal Walt's Gran Torino. The story starts there helping build the relation between Tao and Sue and finally ends up Walt helping Tao getting rid of those gangsters. But at what cost and for that you have to watch the movie.This is a very good drama and everything looks good. I would pick Clint Eastwood's performance, dialogs and the ending are most valuable assets to this movie. 0.3841666666666667\n",

      "As the world changes around Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) he finds himself in a place that he once loved surrounded by people he now hates. His family has grown distant from him and he has no understanding or relationship with his grandchildren. Veteran and upstanding citizen Walt despises the changes that have happened as more and more immigrants move to his neighborhood bringing with them decay and gang violence. When all the trouble of the neighborhood finds a way to the house next-door he is thrown into a process of disgust and growth that will define his life.Eastwood directs a classic film that he was destined to lead in. The rough edges of the setting and acting work perfectly as Walt works to maintain the life of dignity and respect he has built. All this comes to a head as his young neighbor Thou (Bee Vang) fails the initiation given to him by his cousin's neighborhood gang. This scene opens the film to the growth and understanding that Walt goes through as he begins to come to terms with the people behind his prejudice.Eastwood keeps the film simple and direct, no punches are pulled when the movie comes to violence and the script is believable without being overdone. The veteran actor of Eastwood shows what he does best in a tough no nonsense delivery. The other actors take their roles and make them real as the film progresses adding to the authentic feel.Lighting and cinematography are natural and do not come as a distraction throughout the film. The same can be said with the soundtrack as the music sets the scenes without overpowering them, the story is left to the actors. One exception I could mention is the song \"Grand Torino\" which opens the credit roll. The song is placed perfectly and may come over as a surprise as the opening bars are done by Eastwood himself.The dark aspects of the film carry the same weight as those in the previous film Eastwood directed and acted in \"Million Dollar Baby\". The same can be said of the thematic elements as both deal with growing emotionally in the later years of life.As Grand Torino is shot in Michigan it seems only natural for Walt to cherish the title's name sake car. The Grand Torino in the film serves to symbolize the things that people have gained over the course of their lives, things that they have grown to cherish. It also gives a talking point that seems to bridge the cultures and generations throughout the film. Eastwood is able to pull a genuine piece of classic American history and use it to present the changing world that surrounds us all. 0.16052971576227393\n",

      "If you sort of follow the Clint Eastwood characters through the early Westerns, the Dirty Harry movies, Heartbreak Ridge, and Space Cowboys, this one completes the natural development. Blunt but gruffly caring, Eastwood is one persona I never mind seeing trotted out. Here he plays a grandfather and widower with a secret but serious medical condition who gets in a back and forth with a nasty Korean gang. Along the way he first offends and then befriends the Korean family next door, the children \"Toad\" and \"Sue\" being particularly exquisitely played, they in part make this movie. Clint's strategy for terminating the gang is unusual but logical in retrospect. I thought the final wrap on this movie could have been done a little better, otherwise it is top grade cinema. 0.02230392156862745\n",
      "I find most of Eastwood's films since his \"Spaghetti Western\" days get rave reviews, despite the fact that they're mostly pretty mediocre fare, and this one's no exception.The basic storyline is familiar enough, if maybe having a few concessions to 21st century culture. But the litany of caricatures instead of more rounded-out rolls just annoys the hell out of me. Is there any group of people that are as \"all evil all the time\" as Walt's neighborhood gang? Or anyone as condescending and clueless as his son and daughter-in-law? And then Walt himself is horrendously uneven in his demeanor. He's gruff and bigoted one minute, and then drops over to the neighbor's house for a meal and stays on even after numerous gaffs and confrontations and even though the lady of the house seems to hate his guts. He fluctuates between unbelievably hateful and defensive to \"old softy\" without little reason or predictability. The overall impression being not very credible. He's obviously a character in a movie, and the script takes every opportunity to remind us of that.Then after Walt and \"Toad\" assume the traditional mentor/lackey relationship mode, Walt starts out by teaching Toad to \"talk like a man\" with absolutely stupid, even silly results. I'm amazed that that whole bit didn't end up on the cutting room floor. I guess they needed some filler material. Anyway, that bit was lame.And then to think that a drive-by shooting (with full-automatic weapons no less) and the savage, brutal rape and beating of a young girl wouldn't result in any arrests, but somehow the murder of a white guy would convince the neighbors to all come forward to accuse the gang, well, it strains credulity yet again. And further, somehow the fact that Walt was not really armed would seal the gang's fate, but gunning him down (again with full-auto weapons) would somehow have been justified if Walt HAD been carrying a gun, again just comes off as utterly irrational. Maybe the idea of an \"honest\" gunfight worked in the old westerns, but it doesn't in the real world. Again, silliness.While I enjoyed much of Walt's curmudgeonly, in-your-face, brutal honesty, the over-the-top excesses worked against every really suspending your disbelief to get into the movie. I wish Mr. Eastwood would've toned down the extremes a little in all the characters and had a little bit better script to work with. Like \"The Gauntlet\" or \"High Plains Drifter\" or so much of his other work, a little restraint would've made SUCH a better movie... -0.05522353714661405\n",

He's alienated from his sons, thinks his grandchildren are disrespectful. Also he's apparently dying of cancer.He's pretty openly racist, living in a neighborhood where Hmong immigrants are moving in. He gets involved in a conflict between some gangbangers and a Hmong family that lives next door.This is really one of Clint's best performances. He takes the young man under his wing and guides him. He starts out being prejudiced, but then develops an understanding of the Hmong during the course of the movie.The best part was when he locked the young kid in his basement to keep him from taking revenge.

Instead of doing the expected Taxi Driver thing of shooting up the bad guys, our hero decides to let the villains kill him in order to get them arrested.

It doesn't take a genius to understand after you fill an old man full of lead in your own front yard that you should get the heck out of there and escape. But none of them do, not a single member of the entire gang. Apparently they just sit there and wait for the police to arrive to be arrested.

The second part is almost humor-less and is very emotional.

      "Movie Name: Gran Torino, (2008) Director: Clint Eastwood Main Cast: Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Doua Moua, Christopher Carley Plot Summary: Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this modern day cultural and gang war as Walt Kowalsksi. Walt is a recently widowed retired auto worker and veteran who is strong minded to say it nicely. The only solid relationship he has is with his Labrador retriever, who maintains his allegiance to his owner as he intoxicates daily on his front porch taking in the sights of his once all-white neighborhood in Detroit. Although Walt has children, the only true love he shows is to his 1972 Gran Torino and his dog.Tough economic times of Detroit have allowed other cultures to migrate, which has brought the inner city gangs to his once quiet neighborhood. Much to Walt's disliking, a Hmong family moves in next door to him. Among these neighbors are Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), his sister Sue (Ahney Her), and their grandmother (Chee Thao). Their arrival also brings their extended family and cousin, Spider (Doua Moua), and his many gang friends. Spider immediately tries to recruit his introvert cousin, Thao, to become part of their gang with an initiation of stealing Walt's Gran Torino. However, Thao is caught in the act and ordered to pay back his dues through community service and handy work to Walt by order of his grandmother.Although neither character is happy about the community service, Walt becomes close to Thao Vang the father figure that Thao Vang is missing and helps him get his life in order, as well as becomes a good friend to Sue and their grandmother. Not pleased that Thao is not going to join his gang, Spider threatens Thao and his gang friends capture, rape, and beat Sue to make their point. Walt and Thao Vang know they need to make a stand with Spider and his gang friends.Realizing that Thao Vang is a young boy with a bright future, and he is just a lonely man with little relationships, Walt locks up Thao Vang is his basement to keep him away from gunfire and trouble. Taking matters into his own hands, Walt makes a big entrance and confronts Spider and his gang members and makes them think he has a gun when he was reaching for a lighter. Spider and his gang friends shoot and kill Walt in front of the entire neighborhood. However, Walt and his once quiet neighborhood wins because they have witnesses to shooting him when he was not armed. Spider and his friends are arrested and sent to prison for their crimes.Theme: Malcolm X said it best when he said, \"you have to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything.\" If a gruff, old Korean War veteran can see past the skin color and open his heart to an Asian family, then anyone can open their heart and eyes to change. Walt knew that the law was not going to protect his neighborhood, so he took a stand and stood up for himself, his newfound family, and the rights of his other neighbors.Plot Points: Clint Eastwood holds true to his normal gruff character in Gran Torino with a point to prove in unconventional manners, such as Dirty Harry, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and even Million Dollar Baby. However, the point to prove in Gran Torino is to do what is right for the community.A motif used throughout this movie was Walt's car, the Gran Torino. Walt's Gran Torino is a symbol of how something good can withstand the test of time, even in gang infested city like Detroit. Various camera angle techniques, such as panning were utilized in this movie to shoot from Walt's perspective and from the location of his front porch. Sound effects included various background suspenseful music to add drama to many of the confrontational scenes, such as Walt pulling a gun on the gang when they learn that Thao Vang does not want to join the gang, the return of Sue from her brutal beating, and the scene where Walt takes a stand to the gang.Conclusion: Gran Torino depicts various cultural and societal issues like racism, crime, relationship issues, and good versus bad. This is a war on what is right and wrong. Walt succumbed to what was right for his community by taking a stand to the gangs of his neighborhood, and he went out with a bang so the neighborhood could be peaceful again.References: Eastwood, C.

      "Having recently lost his wife a retired automaker and Korean War veteran named \"Walt Kowalski\" (Clint Eastwood) is angry at the way the world around him has changed. For starters, the economic situation in his hometown of Detroit has not only devastated the livelihoods of everyone around him but a massive influx of Khmer refugees into his neighborhood has also changed things as well. To that extent, he simply wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, when he catches his young next-door neighbor \"Thao\" (Bee Vang) attempting to steal his pristine 1972 Gran Torino, he suddenly becomes more involved in the neighborhood than he could have ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will freely admit that Clint Eastwood has starred in a couple of rather weak films from time to time. Fortunately, this is not the case here as he delivers an excellent performance in this particular film. Admittedly, I didn't care for some of the language and would have liked a slightly different ending, but all things considered I consider this to be one of the better movies for that year and I have rated it accordingly. 0.151984126984127\n",

Lines weren't always delivered the best. But it was overall enjoyable, very funny as well for a movie that I didn't think would be. If you enjoy movies you will likely enjoy this.

A story about life and death, friendship and sacrifice, it brings the mythical themes at the centre of so many Eastwood films to a kind of culmination in a working class suburban neighbourhood.

Walt is a retired Korean veteran who has old fashioned beliefs and strong moral codes, however is family are a disgusting portrayal of the kind of family Walt would have raised. So for me this makes no sense whatsoever, he's bitter and hates the world. Yet later in the film talks about the love of his wife, which changed his life, so why does a man with so much love in his life have such an hatred for everything?! ..Anyway back to the funeral; so on one hand Walt hates everyone yet there's a packed church for his wife??! If this evil hate filled man had anyway influenced this woman's life, she'd be just as miserable as he was and NO ONE would be attending the funeral family or otherwise. Now let's move onto the main ridiculous plot of the this farcical film. A family of Hmong (Koreans) live next door and of course Walt hates them as he does everyone. (I don't know how he gets up in the morning or for what purpose other than to hate on life). One member of this family Thao a young teenager who is also unable to speak or act for most of the film. Thao has a cousin who is part of a Gang of Four who drive round not particularly doing anything other than trying to recruit Thao who is by all accounts useless. The gang try and recruit him to steal Walts car (the Gran Torino) which fails and is caught by Walt. The pair then later build up a relationship over the next long 80 or so minutes with ridiculous growling by Clint at scenes with his family and other awful situations where the relationship grows between the old Man and the Young teenager. When I woke up the gangs were back and were doubting a cigarette on Thao's face just because he got a job on a construction site!!! Madness. This results in our hate filled Walt going to the gangs hideout and beating up one of them, not thinking they'd come back for him. His this guy out of his mind, he's a 70 something year old man who lives alone with a rifle, yeah Clint there petrified! Meanwhile the gang have access to semi automatic weapons and out number him 10-1, in reality they'd have smashed his house up and burnt it to the ground or worse just shot him in the street. I mean come on guys there either a \"gang\" we're trying to portray as ruthless thugs or are they supposed to be off a Broadway musical? The film gets worse and worse with the final scene where Walt lets himself get murdered by the gang with his genius plan that they'll all be sent to prison!! HAHAHA don't make me laugh does he really believe that 1. The community will give statements and follow this through to court even though they terrorise the neighbourhood and 2. That every member of the gang will be convicted when he's turned up at their house and used threatening behaviour to make them believe he was going to pull out a gun. 3. Finally if they were convicted surely they have connections or family other than the 4 of them to go after Thao and the witnesses. In summary loads and loads of plot holes, ridiculous acting but I have got to give credit where it's due, for someone to take a decent idea for a movie and produce this load of tripe then bravo Clint you truly are a master time thief!!! -0.11592958502939849\n",
      "This review contains spoilers: I am kind of amazed at the good reviews for this film however I am not surprised. This film is so full of right wing white supremacist pro patriarchy, pro America, pro military propaganda that it makes my blood curdle. The film is about a lone white ex Korean military man who saves a Hmong immigrant family from a terrible Hmong gang and terrible African American hoods. The allusions to Christ are obvious but I won't elaborate so as not to spoil the ending for any readers still with me. The message embedded in this film, I believe, is that American militaristic male white-hood is there to save everyone else from themselves so you all can rest easy. Quite the task however it would appear Clint Eastwood believes America and Christ are up to it. The acting is not that great and seems forced. Eastwood playing a curmudgeon who swears a lot and believes that male bonding is all about exchanging insults with other men who insult him right back. There is a scene where he and his barber are trying to teach a Hmong teenager how to do this and naturally all is right with the world once said Hmong teenager has mastered the technique and thrown some zingers himself which immensely impress the two white men. White male America teaching the world how to be manly it would appear and so the film. 0.04440836940836938\n",
      "I cannot believe the high rating for this AWFUL film! I so looked forward to this movie after watching the previews but it is so bad! To sum it up quickly, old bigot Eastwood turns overnight into a guy who sacrifices himself to help his Asian neighbors. Gee what a great premise. And it has a horribly sappy Hollywood ending tossed in if that isn't bad enough. If you are looking for action, there are NO killings at all in the movie until the end which was very anti-climatic. Yes I know they call is a \"feel good movie\".

      "One of the worst movie ever. Unbelievely racist and unrealistic. Did the even research Asian culture they depicted or did they just swap in stereotypes about black people. CLint Eastwood's character is racist the entire movie, openly and the Asian characters laugh or put up with it. THe character of Thao is shown to be weak and needs Clint Eastwood, a white man to teach him how to act. There is a scene where Thao's sister interacts with black men and well, it racist. The black men want to rape her and her hip-hip white boy boyfriend is a pussy who tries to befriend the black guys until CLint Eastwood, or super Whitey comes to save the day, call the black guys a racial slur and point a gun at them. THao's cousins are gangsters and when he doesn't join their gang they rape his sister. THe hell? That never happens, I mean they raped their cousin. Once again Clint saves the day and sacrifices his life for his Asain friends. He leaves Thao a Gran Torino and says racist things about every ethnicity in his will.

      "The majority of reviews seem to disagree with me, so maybe more people who think this film is \"awful\" should say so. I can't even think of another movie that is as boring. As an alumni of a liberal arts college (one of my majors was in literature and I also studied film) I think I recognize \"art\" when I see it. This was NOT \"art\" - not to me. It was one long, boring, yawn-fest. It was a huge disappointment because of the high ratings, and rave reviews, so I would appreciate anyone who agrees that it is an awful movie giving it a review. Most people only bother to write about films they enjoy. This is a film that more people who did not enjoy should take the time to warn others (even Clint Eastwood fans like myself) not to watch. Truly, saying anything about it, may be a \"spoiler\" because it lacks story, it lacks everything that makes a fine film except for good acting. But the best acting in the world cannot save a horrible waste of time, which sums up this movie. If you have seen the previews or a trailer, you have seen a \"spoiler\" and the best of the movie. If you want to bother with a couple of hours of waiting for those \"great artistic moments\" in the trailers for the film, then this movie is for you. Perhaps to the people who see art in squares of paint and call it \"abstract\", this is an artistic film. To me, it is pseudo-art at best, just a day in the life of a grumpy old bigot that lives in a bad part of town does not make \"art\" and that is all this film is made of, a boring story that could happen to anyone that lives in a bad part of any town. Feel like watching that - go ahead, but at least give it the review it deserves, even if you do love Clint Eastwood, I honestly don't see how anyone could feel the same about the movie. Maybe I am missing something - maybe for people who go to car shows, the Gran Torino itself is the art. 0.008380952380952392\n",
      "Being a fan of older Clint Eastwood movies I am happy to say that this is not the last we will be seeing of him. It has been widely speculated that this will be his last movie but I can confirm now with the utmost certainty that this will not because there is no way in HELL Clint would allow his career to end with a ball of HORSESH*T as bad as this. I can't remember being more disappointed leaving a cinema. Maybe they were trying to resurrect a character Clint is no longer physically able to play. He just growled all the way through the movie. The movie starts with his wife's funeral and a catholic priest trying to fulfill the dying wish of Clint's wife of getting him to go to confession. You immediately know that by the end this will happen to give him his redemption. He then becomes acquainted with the neighbours, none of whom can act. One in particular, Sue Lor, was so annoying that when she was badly brutalized later it was impossible to feel bad. This is a bad telling of an old story about a grizzled old man whose heart is melted and who finds peace before dying. It has been told a hundred times before and each time better than this one.

The Hmong-Americans should be ashamed to have let this man exploit their community for his own personal agenda. The big shoot-out scene at the end looks like something from a police training course, where cardboard figures appear in every window and doorway. Don't shoot - he's only reaching for his lighter!

      "Clint Eastwood has really gone off the deep end with this quasi-moral story featuring a pretty decent turn from Eastwood. The Asian actor who plays Thao, however is beyond bad, its almost laughable. The story is completely non-existent, and nothing happens for about the first 90 minutes. There are so many cliché and unoriginal moments, its almost perplexing how Eastwood ever went from Million Dollar Baby to this crap.Sometimes sappy, sometimes boring, sometimes unwatchable, it had very few moments of clarity or anything that made sense. Next time, Clint, get another screenwriter, the constant racist slurs got tired, fast, and the rest of the exchanges were some of the worst I've ever come across in my life. I expected a lot better. A WHOLE lot better. -0.058787878787878806\n",
      "Like most others, I like Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director (at least from around the year 2000 onwards). \"Million dollar baby\" and \"Changeling\" were two quite lovely films to give just two examples of him as a director. \"Gran Torino\" definitely had its strong points, and I enjoyed the themes of misplaced racism, and how it sucks the joy out of life, the unsolvable problem with gangs, and the need to get your problems off your chest instead of keeping them inside. I also liked the pale colours of this film (just like in Changeling), which was perfect for this bleak environment. But the problem for me with this film was simply that it wasn't very credible.The main character Walt (Eastwood himself) used a lot of foul language, but as he did so in almost every sentence and so overtly, it simply ended up becoming a caricature. At one point his son and daughter in law came to Walt's birthday and suggested that he moved into a nursing home. The camera then filmed a close-up of Eastwood, whose mouth opened and turned downwards more and more in a fit of rage. It just seemed like something from a comic book. Eastwood is one of the archetypical tough guys, but here he simply seemed like a parody of himself. Later, Eastwood dropped a glass of alcohol as he was shocked. It just fell to the ground all too late for it to seem like a believable reaction and not one done by an actor in a poor film (it will make sense if you watch the scene). This is of course a minor detail, but it honestly seemed to suggest that there hadn't been paid enough attention to the editing and the artistic effects used in creating a story that would seem real rather than just a story. This surprised me a bit, as I didn't notice anything like this in the two other Eastwood film mentioned above.One of the other actors, Bee Vang playing Thao, was even worse. He simply didn't give a very good performance. Especially when he was locked into the basement, his hammering on the door simply didn't seem real.Lastly, I didn't find it believable that Walt warmed to the Hmong people because of the reasons shown in the film. It seemed credible that he would help the neighbouring girl when she was in trouble with a gang on the street, but he still a bit too easily went from banning all Hmong people from his property to accepting the neighbouring girl's dinner invitation with her entire family simply because they had beer and because the girl was \"alright\" as he said. Nevertheless, this was something that I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the film had been better – they are after all trying to tell a story, and there has to be some progress.With better dialogue, better acting and a slightly better script, this film could have made me feel something real rather than make me cringe – which is what it too often did.Judging from the average rating here on IMDb most people love this film, but I've also seen several people here on IMDb say exactly the same things as I have done in this review (acting, dialogue, etc.), so it seems to be a film that splits the viewers in two camps. I find that if I don't like an otherwise celebrated film it's simply because I didn't become engaged in the story or the characters. But usually I just find films like that mediocre and I can see why other people might like them, and usually I can see that they are well-made and well-acted. Two examples could be Crash or Magnolia. They simply didn't do anything for me. They were well-made, well-acted, and I understand why people like them. But calling them poor films or even poorly made? Certainly not! It's rare that I find an otherwise celebrated film poor, but Gran Torino seems to be a film that people either find excellent or poor. I'm standing on the edge of saying poor (which is 3/10 for me), but due to it's good points I will give it 4/10. 0.11153305203938112\n",
      "Overall, This movie was bad in my opinion. I'm not sure why so many people gave it high ratings and seemingly overlooked all of its flaws. I'm assuming Clint Eastwood fans got caught up in his acting performance.The movie begins and ends with Clint Eastwood's character while almost every other character is uni-dimensional with little or no depth at all. The kids from the local gangs might as well be witches from your typical fairytale. They are just about as mean and despicable as the storyline needs them to be with no context behind their actions. There's a random scene where (one of the key characters) a Hmong-American girl walks with her white boyfriend, and encounters a group of 3 African American kids who appear to be some sort of gang. The incredibly predictable interaction is just a bunch of awkward cliché lines thrown back and forth between the white guy and the gang. But of course, Clint Eastwood magically appears at the right time to save the girl from the evil gang. That scene came out of nowhere and completely threw me off balance. Sadly, it wasn't just a bad scene, it pretty much set the tone for the rest of the movie.The best way to describe this film would be something stuck between a heavy drama and a feel good story. Every time the story threatens to get too dramatic, you suddenly get pulled back into the \"feel good\" setting and vice versa. It goes head on on heavy subjects like racism, gangs, life and death, hatred, and war, yet it doesn't fully develop on any of them. One thing that really bothered me was: Why would Thao's cousin (the main \"antagonist\") attempt to murder members of his own family following Clint's assault. He basically sprayed his auntie's house with bullets, and raped or ordered the rape and/or assault of Taoh's sister (his own cousin!?). and we know nothing about who he is or his true motivations. -0.0002934662236987772\n",
      "If you succeed in comprehending the dialogue in this movie, you will find that it contains no interesting or unpredictable lines, apart from the ugly racist sneers uttered by Clint Eastwood, whose voice --- never good --- is worse than ever. Ahney Her (as Sue) is no advertisement for Hmong elocution, since she s generally incomprehensible. She seemed to have developed some rare skill of gobbling her words: perhaps it's a Hmong thing. Apart from the lousy delivery, the film is remarkably uncertain about its handling of the key plot element: ethnic gangs. The most uncertain moment is when the gang pestering Sue's family has the astonishing experience of having one of its members beaten up by a very old man in its own gang house, and do they go to Clint's house for a showdown with him? No, they go to Sue's house! Well, that way, Clint lives to die another day.

These are too many stereotypes to be thrown in my face by one film.But the worst thing about this film is the horrible acting by every single cast member, especially the Korean family and there over annoying children who cannot act one bit.

His character annoyed me, but I somehow felt sympathy for him at the end when he met his death, and this is why I have given it a 4.This film could of been amazing and could of been worthy of the 8.2 is has on IMDb, but yet it has not even closely resembled that or lived up to it.

It isn't that the film was bad. It was just about as average as I can imagine, worth one viewing and maybe another.I would describe this as just another Eastwood chick flick except that it is too aggressive to be a chick flick. But, the almost total lack of real action misses the mark as a guy movie too. I can't imagine the supposed target audience, unless it is old-school white people wanting to purge themselves of racial guilt by getting past a long laundry list of disparaging terms for Asians.I REALLY enjoyed all the screen time devoted to the '72 Gran Torino Sport, one of my all time favorite cars. But, I seriously doubt that many viewers care about this particular car.Most of the \"thrilling\" spots are all bluff and NON-action anti-climax. Where Josey Wales KILLED for his new friends of another race, and set things right, Walt simply forfeits his worthless, doomed life to entrap the bad guys for the cops.

However, there are inaccurate portrayals of the Hmong and their culture in this film. The Hmong don't hu plig in front of a table, it is supposed to be at the front door. They don't butcher the chickens by cutting their heads off completely and elderly Hmong people don't chew on tobacco, that portrayal portrays another ethnic group in Laos who chews on tobacco. And the Hmong do not eat dumplings. That is a Chinese thing! Once again the dumpling scene just lumps all Asians into the Chinese category. The ignorance of the film is unbearable. Overall, I am disappointed that the Hmong people in this film didn't speak up nor educate the producers about depicting the culture in an accurate manner. 0.02500000000000001\n",
      "I had some expectations when I read all these positive reviews with the high box office scores but I was so disappointed. I missed certain suspense and some intriguing elements in this simply unspectacular neighbor drama. What I found interesting therefore was how the relation ship between the neighbors developed itself. The message is no doubt that people should respect and help each other much more if it's not already the case. Then I liked all the funny jokes from Mister Kowalski even if they weren't always friendly. Anyway, be prepared on some slow paced sequences and don't expect an amazing movie. My wife felt asleep from the second part. For all these reasons I gave just 5/10 and believe me the high votes here are too overrated. 0.16538579067990833\n",

      "Being from the Suburbs of Detroit. I was really looking forward to this movie.....However.... Not what I expected. Very Disappointing. Not sure what the point of the movie then best I got out of it is Walt ( Clint Eastwood) was feeling quilty after his wife passed, that he was in Korean war and killed a bunch of gooks and now living next door to a very thoughtful family and in a neighborhood full of what he killed in Korea. The best part of the moving in my opinion was the 1972 Gran Tourino Yes he worked for Ford Motor Company all his life. And the Car was Very SWEET. there is a moral to the story for those who feel you need to make amends for your actions before your day comes to pass and that is what this movie is about. It is slow. with little action. a Lesson to learn if you care to pay attention and hear the message that is being said here. 0.10046875000000001\n",
      "Gran Torino- This is another pro-immigration movie, obviously by a leftist company such as Warner Bros.! The other ones I can think of were Falling Down with Michael Douglas and House of Sand and Fog. Typical of the left(including the Seattle area) is the ideology that white people are all evil racists and immigrants are all somehow \"angels from heaven that can do no wrong!\" This movie like House of Sand and Fog indicates that white people are losing their property and homes to immigrants, who seem to win in the end! I used to think of Clint Eastwood as being a \"law and order conservative,\" but over recent years, he has in various ways proved himself moving to far to the left.

      "*** Spoilers Alert ***Before I get started I love Clint Eastwood and his movies. I love Unforgivable and Million Dollar Baby to death. This are one of the best epic movies that Clint Eastwood directed. I love Dollars aka Man With No Name Trilogy, Dirty Harry franchise series all of them to death. High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Rookie, Absolute Power, True Crime, Blood Work, Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes. Gran Torino fails highly, Clint Eastwood is a racist in this movie and trough whole movie he does nothing but bad mouthing and judging people insulting a Chinese child and his Chinese People. His own son and his family does not respect him so no one does.I have a problem that trough whole movie I saw Eastwood's son only three times and only what he cared was him self and his wife and children. What a selfish prick, Eatswood made a selfish not caring character for his son. They are Asian Gangs and all Eastwood does is showing a gun beating some guy and talking his war experience and showing his fingers as some old cowboy but that is all he does. They are showing a realistic racism Drama. But I didn't pay to see a racism drama I pay to see Clint Eastwood Kick Ass!!! The Gang one of Tao Chinese kid cousin drove with the car and they start shooting on his own relative house because Eastwood interfered and beat one of the gang member by warning him to stay away from Tao.Why they did shoot of the leader's cousin's house and he was involved?, Tao or his family didn't attacked them, Eastwood did why not shooting his house instead?. This movie also impersonates scenes from Steven Seagal's action movies Marked for Death and Out For Justice. Even Marked for Death was million times better. When Eastwood at the end shows up by gang's house and he grab in the pocket for lighter and than gang blows him away. Similar scene I saw in Seagal's action movie Out for Justice where Gino show's up for the final showdown. Eastwood doesn't do anything but let him self blown away. Why did he do that? Doesn't he have nothing to live for anymore? This movie is long, boring, stupid and a true disappointment. I didn't pay to see a racism Drama where my hero Clint Eastwood is a racist trough whole movie and than he gets blown away at the end of the movie. This is an overrated movie not even Where Eagles Dare is so overrated even Dirty Harry is not overrated.

      "I give this movie a 5 star rating and my reasons are as follows.The cinematography is stunning, much like Clint's Mystic River and Unforgiven. I found the portrayal of gang culture - although this is not the main focus of the film - quite convincing including the gang members' patent violations of Natural Law. I particularly enjoyed how peer pressure was shown in the film - as when Taoh's cousin encourages him to join his gang - and I found the scene where Sue and boyfriend are accosted by nefarious black youths particularly well done.Unlike other reviewers, the high point for me in the acting department was Sue, Taoh's sister. I found her acting contribution the most memorable of the entire cast, including Clint's. Taoh himself, although I initially liked him as a thoughtful, quiet, bookish boy, abused by family and strangers alike, annoyed me as he learnt to \"speak and act like a man\" under Walter's influence.I have to admit part of the reason my score has gone down a few notches is due to my distaste for macho culture, as evidenced in the barber and construction site scenes, where Clint teaches the ever irritating and gullible Taoh (he's a kid to be fair) how to be one of those 'hard working', rude, sexist, racist money slaves that never think critically for one second or open a book in a lifetime. Call me butthurt if you like, but being creative and sensitive myself, I find the whole man's paradigm (including having tools and being good at carpentry and practical crap like that) presented glibly in the film quite unpalatable.But ultimately what prevents me from giving this film a higher score is its lack of sophistication, resorting to stereotyping, sentimentality and shock value to drive its points home as opposed to transcending thoughtlessness and expanding consciousness about our world, a thing which I concede is rarely achieved in film. Some examples of this are Oliver Stone's Wall Street, John Carpenter's They Live, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.So if you're looking for a thoughtful, meaningful, truthful romp this is not it, but the film is nevertheless watchable (despite poor acting from some of the cast as has been mentioned in other reviews) and I enjoyed it enough to watch till the end. 0.11682570384698047\n",

      "This is a junk and insulting movie. Eastwood used it as an opportunity to characterize the urban white working class as nothing more than ignorant bigots and racists. His Walt Kowalski character hates everyone who is not white and lets out a string of racial slurs at every opportunity until he is \"educated\" by the \"sophisticated\" Hmongs. Give me a break. Eastwood spent nearly his entire adult life among the Hollywood elites. He knows nothing about working class America. He does the same thing in many of his films. Letters from Iwo Jima portrayed the US Marines as thugs while the Japanese were cultured and educated warriors. All his cop movies showed the police as either violent psychopaths willing to break the law to get the baddy or bureaucratic fools. His Heartbreak Ridge showed the Marines again as frat boys while the officers and senior NCOs were useless fools. Bridges of Madison county was a huge rip on middle class values like the family, marriage and morality. Go away Clint. Go away. -0.002777777777777777\n",
      "I was informed that this movie was about cars and that I could like it for that, as I am a car lover. Despite that, I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie. Even so, the way it was described to me made me imagine it would be something like NASCAR, rallies or even something like Herbie's films (which also have a lot of car races) or of the type car chases. In the end, it has very little of cars and no automobile action. As such, it didn't match my expectations. It was a pretty weak movie.It was a surprise to see \"Blondie\" from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' looking so old and with that raucous voice, even though I know he's now 80.Clint Eastwood's character was hilarious at times. The guy was old but though, with balls of steel. Whenever he called Thao \"Toad\" (frog) it was hilarious, as well as whenever he kept calling Youa \"Yum Yum\" (it kinda makes me wonder: was it because he had trouble to pronounce her name or was the old man saying she was delicious, huh?) :DIt was also hilarious that, despite his initial rage against Thao for attempting to steal his precious 1972 Ford Gran Torino, slowly he ended up being friends with him and even his protector - and how he thought of Thao as a banana (even for being shy with women).But generally speaking this wasn't much of a movie. Besides, I didn't enjoy things such as Thao being a victim of bullying and blackmail by his cousin and his crime partners. I also hated the ending because Eastwood's character got killed. I always thought he was gonna \"clean\" them all. Instead, he's the one who gets shot and, as if that wasn't enough, we find out that he didn't bring any gun with him (it was as if he wanted them to murder him). 0.05396505376344085\n",

      "The two dominant characters in the movie are not the \"leads\" - but two of the side characters. Grandma (played by Chee Thao) and Daisy (Walt's dog - and only friend). Their roles are not insignificant, though they will be overlooked by most viewers and critics because their angles in the story are perhaps the most subtle of all of the characters.Yes, this movie pushes messages about matters we face today - racism, teenage life, generational and societal divides, political correctness, coming of age, aging parents and selfish children, redemption, etc. These messages are carried in a way that is neither condescending/cutesie-poo or blatantly over-the-top. They are delivered plainly and in everyday language, blunt without being obnoxious. Eastwood gave these messages to us in a way that are easy to understand without being preachy...and left the choice to viewers in how to carry those messages out of the theater.There are elements in the movie that some will say are \"award magnets\" and obvious tear-jerkers. Not so, in my opinion. Yes, there are dramatic moments and the audience fully expects them. How the moments are presented are just a part of the grander picture...no more, no less. The dialog is thin, at best, and the actors' timing is off in many scenes. Yet these short-comings do not detract from the overall enjoyment of what the story is selling.Back to Grandma and Daisy. Grandma is the Hmong counterpart to Walt - the crotchety old Korean war veteran who is, on the surface, very much a product of his era - cranky, racist old man -and I wonder how many will really appreciate the classic line, \"Get off my lawn!\"- but Grandma is his mirror. She demonstrates the fabric of humanity that binds people of different cultures in their similarities...when usually all we see is our respective differences. While Sue (Ahney Her) is the voice of the next generation with open eyes, her grandmother is the voice of the preceding era, from whom Sue learned how to read and understand a man like Walt. It's a very subtle and delicate bridge that I suspect many will miss.Daisy is the gentle side of Walt. His faithful companion, she is the solid (if silent) presence that demonstrates from the very beginning that there is more to Walt than meets the eye. Some will just automatically assume the \"Man's Best Friend\" position - but there are several clues from the opening scenes that give away Daisy's facet of Walt's character...which culminate in the closing scene.While most people will likely focus on the dramatic events and trite dialog to form their opinions of this movie, I'd like to offer up these thoughts to present a perhaps different perspective that is (hopefully) worth noting. Overall, the movie is weak, but the storyline is compelling and the nuances make it worth going to see. 0.08293040293040296\n",

After seeing the movie, I think Clint should have stuck with his original plan.In one of the promo's for the movie, the tag line is \"Classic Eastwood\". I guess this begs the question, what is classic Eastwood? He is a very versatile actor and except for a few clinkers like, Paint your Wagon, he has proved that he can easily handle a wide range of parts and they are all \"classic Eastwood\" in their own way.I guess my disappointment with GT is the shift from his patented tough guy that gets justice for the weak type character, to a man finding himself close to death, and choosing to sacrifice himself without a fight. The whole \"getting justice without a fight\" is a noble premise, but in reality the gang members were probably going to receive a 20 year sentence, and be out in 5 to finish what they started.Speaking for myself, if Clint starts out as \"Dirty Harry\" in a movie, he needs to finish that way. 0.04027777777777775\n",

      "Surly, widowed, fiercely bigoted Korean War veteran and blue-collar retiree Walt Kowalski lives alone with his Labrador, is furiously protective of his Detroit suburb home, and shuns virtually everyone in his life from his own family, to the local young Catholic priest, and most especially his neighbors--a close-knit Hmong community who've begun to dominate the neighborhood. As gang violence escalates within the area, slowly but surely Walt finds himself becoming protective of his odd new neighbors. The story is about as straightforward as it gets, thus making the film's trajectory pretty obvious, but watching this crusty old codger come to terms with himself and those around him makes for more entertainment than expected. Meaningful and well-made with a cast of primarily novice actors, fortunately they're in good hands with veteran actor/producer/director Eastwood, though admittedly with his established tough guy image it's easy to be reminded of Dirty Harry, Heartbreak Ridge, et al., making this hard to recommend to non-fans. **½ 0.1517583239805462\n",
      "Gran Torino is a simple story of a man, his pride, the neighborhood he has lived in for years, and his prized mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood portrays Korean War Veteran Walt Kowlaski, a very unhappy, grumpy, and bull headed man who can't seem to get along with his neighbors or his own kids. Walt is a very traditional man who wants doesn't seem to like his unappreciated kids and grandkids. His granddaughter Ashley shows little interest into him, only for the fact that she is turning 16 and hoping that she can get his Gran Torino as a gift. While she doesn't do anything to warrant the Gran Torino she hopes that being \"Grandpa's Little Girl\" will play out. That is before Walt is introduced to Thao.The theme of this movie is overcoming diversity and opening your heart and mind to different cultures and friendships. This is present as Walt befriends his neighbor kid Thao, after Thao tries to steal his Gran Torino after a failed gang initiation. Thao ends up getting into a fight with his cousin who is a gang member, the fight spills over to Walt's lawn, who comes out with an M1 Garand and tells them to get off his lawn. Walt is surprised at the neighbor's reaction to his \"heroics\" for driving the gang out of the neighborhood. This starts Walt and him opening up to the culture that he brutally attacked in the Korean War. He takes Thao under his wings, gets him a construction job, and has him fix things around the neighborhood. While he is teaching, Thao to be an upstanding, loyal man he still has to fight off the gang, which ultimately proves to be the end of Walt.Clint Eastwood's \"Gran Torino\" is yet another Eastwood masterpiece that has a feeling and signature that stand out from his \"Dirty Harry\" days. Clint's ability to tell a story about a friendship between an old man and young Korean kid is spellbinding and heartwarming. This movie uses simple camera movements and subtle colors to portray a calm and steady movie. While there are a lot of intense scenes the color and calmness of Walt make the movie run smoothly and doesn't make the movie seem like it's moving too fast or intense.This movie is great for any Clint Eastwood fan, who wants to see a \"Dirty Harry\" type of character. This is not a family movie that should be shown to kids or those who don't like obscene and crude language. -0.027849462365591382\n",
      "** May contain spoilers **In the film Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood, we see a widowed Korean War veteran deal with the generation gap and the cultural prejudice in a neighborhood he has lived in for over 40 years. Walt Kowlaski, played by Clint Eastwood, is the veteran dealing with the recent passing of his wife while a Hmong gang is trying to convert the shy neighbor Thao, played by Bee Vang to a life of a small time gangster. Walt's prejudice is spurred by his past wartime dealings with Asians and his ignorance of the Hmong culture. An admitted failure with raising his own children and having warmed up to Thao's older sister Sue, Walt tries to teach the fatherless Thao what it means to be a man and give him a chance to live up to his potential.The main theme of Gran Torino is overcoming the generation gap and prejudice of other cultures. This is displayed not only with Walt's dealings with the Hmong neighbors, but also with the local priest who presided over his wife's funeral. Walt gets along well with the other people in the film that are from the same generation of blue collar workers, who he banters back and forth with in what Walt later describes to Thao as male conversation. Walt's disgust for the Hmong neighbors and the younger generation can be seen throughout the film. From his comment he makes about how the old neighbors would react to the neighborhood being kept is disrepair to kids who mock an elderly lady after dropping her groceries. You even see some of his disdain for his own grandchildren as he grunts during the funeral when his granddaughter is showing her mid-drift with a navel ring and when she later asks him for his car and sofa after he dies.Finally the young Sue convinces Walt over for a Hmong barbecue where he makes a few cultural errors as she tries to give him some tips. Soon he finds that they are not very much different than his own culture. After witnessing Thao, help the neighbor lady inside with her dropped groceries, and sitting alone in the basement oblivious to a pretty Hmong girl staring at him Walt gives the would be thief some advice. Later the Thao's mother insists Walt lets work of the debt to him by working for him. Slowly Walt sees something of himself in Thao and helps him to help himself. The climax of the movie pushes forward Walt's acceptance the current generation is not completely lost and the Hmong people are hardworking and proud of their culture. With his life at an end, Walt sees he can make a sacrifice so Thao's life can begin.This movie is similar to Generation X where in the protagonist is a young man sent to prison due to his racial prejudice. He comes out of prison with the enlightenment of how his hatred has cost him and tries to convert other kids from the gang life and to respect the difference of others. While the reverse of Walt in age we can see how he clearly comes to the realization that it was his hatred in ignorance of the younger generation and the of the other cultures in his neighborhood that had cost him his happiness and kept him from recognizing the potential of Thao living next door. 0.037306740878169445\n",
      "You don't have to be an Eastwood fan, or even have seen any of his movies, to know what to expect from this performance. He plays a grumpy man who wants nothing to do with his neighbors or anyone else. Whether the movie explains if he was like this before his wife's death, I don't remember. It's been a couple years since I saw the movie (I review some movies with a vague memory). Eventually, he warms up, especially to one of the Korean neighbors, whom he takes under his wing. It's kind of like a dramatic \"Grumpy Old Men\", only without one of the men. The ending is sad and will shock you, especially if you can relate to Eastwood's character.*** out of **** -0.05925925925925926\n",
      "Although Clint Eastwood has appeared in dozens of movies, Gran Torino is his best work yet. Eastwood produced, directed, and starred in this bittersweet film. Gran Torino prospers in multiple scenes because it has the courage to show real-life prejudice situations that most modern films don't have. Through a series of events, Gran Torino confronts the deep-rooted problems of prejudice in America. Eastwood makes this possible due to the authentic plot and the direction the movie takes due to the exceptional acting on Eastwood's part.There's no holding back with the well-known, credible Clint Eastwood. He gives it his all when being the star of the film. Eastwood portrays himself as a grumpy, bitter, and hateful old man. The way he grunts, squints his eyes, and wrinkles his forehead when talking with somebody is very persuasive. He has a consistent sourness to him that makes his acting that much more believable. Because he was a Korean War veteran, he sees the world through a dark lens.Eastwood's character, Walt, lives next to a Korean family that he ultimately cannot tolerate being around. He constantly comes outside with a gun and threatens them to stay off his property. The viewer can tell that Walt isn't at peace with his life and has no happiness based off of the way he sluggishly walks around. Although many viewers will find his personality disgusting and hateful because of the constant racial slurs that come out of his mouth, such as \"gooks\" and \"zipper heads\", he does, believe it or not, have a tender side to him. He's more pleasant and charming than he appears. When an Asian gang begins to cause uproar in his community, he begins to take action and protect his Asian neighbors. He's constantly on look out, making sure him and his neighbors won't be harmed. Because he wants to defeat the gang, he finds allies in his Asian neighbors. His allies eventually turn into long-term friends as the movie progresses.There's almost no comic relief due to the seriousness of the plot. Eastwood did a phenomenal job directing such a nauseating, yet undeniable issue in the United States: prejudice. Many people may not like the obscene language or the use of drug paraphernalia but they need to understand the touching theme of the film; America is a prime example of the \"melting pot.\"As Walt begins to accept the Asians as friends and demonstrates small acts of kindness towards Tao, the Asian boy next door, like letting him borrow the 1972 Gran Torino, the viewer really starts to understand how Eastwood's character begins to see the world through a brighter lens. He finally lets go of his past and begins to accept the world.Walt, at the beginning of the film, was so proud to be a Korean War veteran. What's ironic is the fact that he befriends his Asian neighbors who he once despised. If any viewer doesn't connect and truly enjoy the unexpected yet inspirational ending to the film, then he or she is not a true American who understands the harshness of racism in this country. 0.1471311475409836\n",
      "This movie is not what you would call a masterpiece, but it ranks right up there among the best. As others have stated, it's a movie you can watch over and over and still enjoy. At least one person has stated that they thought all the positive reviews were from the established fan-base of Eastwood. That person is completely wrong. I have never been a fan of Eastwood simply because I've always been a girly girl and was never interested in the types of movies he was associated with. Though I am familiar with the name (Clint Eastwood), I honestly could not confidently answer the question - What other movie has Eastwood starred in? - without having to look up the answer on this website. The only reason I saw the movie is because my husband wanted to see it and the trailer looked pretty good so I was like - Okay, why not. We saw the movie in the theater and I thought it was just wonderful. In the last few years, I have watched the movie about four more times on television, including just last night on TNT. I still love this movie and its skillful acting, subtle humor and underlying lessons on life and people. A few have commented that they thought the ending was wrong. Hello??? Were you even paying attention during the film? Walt had killed young people who looked just like Thao (remember what he told Thao before he left the house). Now, was his chance to try and make amends for that. Remember Sue's statement that Hmong girls go to college and the boys go to jail? Also, remember when Walt made the observation that Thao \"didn't have a chance\" as long as his torturous cousin and his gang were going around terrorizing the neighborhood and out to make everyone's life miserable. Walt chose to die so that Thao and his family could finally have peace and Thao could have a chance at a real future. It may sound a little corny, but Walt died so that Thao's family could have life, and have it more abundantly. Not on the same scale as Jesus of course - but you get the point. When it comes to endings (and beginnings), I don't think you can get any more perfect than that. 0.10895496779643118\n",
      "Gritty and moving, Gran Torino employs dark themes and the talents of seasoned actor/director Clint Eastwood to convey a message of hope, respect and compassion. Despite a slow-paced, character-driven plot with little action, this movie captures viewers' attention with its talented acting, stark simplicity and thought-provoking script. A sprinkling of humor lends the film some variety. The ending is dramatic and profound in its grisly, matter-of-fact sacrifice. What I enjoyed the most were Kowalski's talks with Father Janovich, often providing comic relief, and interactions with his next-door neighbor Sue, who opens his eyes to the bitter old man he's been and inspires him to change. If you enjoy stellar character-driven movies, then Gran Torino is well worth your time.bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com 0.14539473684210524\n",
      "Is there much I can say about Gran Torino? Sure, it's got it's fans, and the ones who dislike the movie; but I find myself asking, how can anyone hate this? Sure apart from Eastwood, the acting is rather sentimental and most of these actors made their debut in Gran Torino, but if we look at it from a story-telling, real life view: its a fantastic movie. Clint Eastwood quite possibly gives his last on-screen performance, and what a way to end his fine, and luscious career. Many people will like and dislike this movie, I'm one to like it; all through its prime humor, dramatic scenes and a excellent ending. Clint Eastwood creates a very dark and rare character in Gran Torino, that'll be looked back in the years to come as: brilliant. 0.19675438596491227\n",
      "SPOILER The movie Gran Torino is about a man named Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood, who is a retired Ford autoworker and Korean War veteran. Walt is a racist bitter old man who just lost his wife of 50 years and is now living alone with his dog an a Detroit neighborhood. Asian immigrants now occupy Mr. Kowalski's neighborhood and his new neighbors are a Hmong family that he dislikes in the beginning of the movie. Walt spends his days taking care of his yard and sitting on his porch drinking beer and giving out ethnic slurs about people in his neighborhood. Walt especially dislikes his new neighbors after he catches Thao, played by Bee Vang, trying to steal his Gran Torino because of his cousin's gang's influence. After Thai's mother finds out that he tried to steal Walt's car she sends him over to Walt's house with his sister sue, played by Ahney Her to make Thao work for Mr. Kowalski as penance for tiring to steal his car. Eventually Walt and thao grow to respect each other and Walt even helps Thao get a construction job. Thao's cousins gang still torments him for not joining the gang and for Walt's interference in the gangs activities with thao and his family. The gang does a drive by shooting of Thao's house as well as kidnapping and raping his sister Sue. Thao goes to Walt's house to have Walt help him get revenge for the attack. Walt tells Thao to come back later that afternoon when they are more calm and able to make decisions. Walt then prepares himself by buying a fitted suit and giving confession. When Thao returns later that afternoon Walt takes him into the basement to show him the silver star he got and to tell him that he did not want Thao to have to experience killing someone so he locks him in the basement. Walt drives to the gang's house and confronts the gang in the front yard. He pulls out a cigarette and asks for a light. When nobody gives him one he reaches in his pocket to pull one out but he makes the gang think that he is pulling out a gun so they end up shooting an unarmed man. Walt's death gives courage to the neighbors and they tell the police what happened sending the gang to jail. Walt ends up giving his life for a bunch of people that he hated in the beginning of the movie but began to respect even more than his own family by the end 0.10251196172248804\n",
      "This movie was verbally emotional for me. Some of the language used was somewhat offensive. I value people for who they are not what color they are. I consider it a blessing to get to know people from other races. It is an opportunity to learn. I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and will continue to be a fan. This movie is an expression of behavior of people who need to get to know each other before they judge each other. It also show how barriers can be dissolved with knowledge and communication. What a wonderful world this world this would be if we could all live together in peace and love. In addition it shows how we should value and embrace our parents. 0.18019480519480519\n",
      "In summary, the film is about a racist war veteran (Walt) who is somehow also the moral compass of the film, despite being a racist. We are ostensibly to accept that this is okay and that he's great because he is old, a war vet, and played by Clint Eastwood. Okay. The film also attempts (clumsily) to make Eastwood's horrible character more sympathetic by making the primary Vietnamese character a thief. I don't find any of this to be particularly great--or realistic--storytelling as others have said. I will say that I like the destination/message of the film--which I do think was well-intentioned--but I hated the path it took to get there. A more realistic story about these themes would have been, \"the world becomes a better place because racist Walt died in Korea.\" 0.15208333333333335\n",
      "I saw Gran Torino several years ago and loved it then. I was looking forward to watching it again for a class assignment. After seeing it again, I realized it was Clint's performance, he plays Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants, this is a man you do not want to mess with. Walt has the perfect growl, he sounds just like a pit-bull dog that wants you out of his yard. Clint as a : writer, director, and an actor, presents Gran Torino with such grace that as a old man that has just lost his wife and it seems that society has forgotten about a veteran that seems to always have a bad mood, but deep down he is a very good and thoughtful and caring man. This part seems to be the perfect part for Clint, if this isn't him in real life, he sure can act. The movie starts with Walt attending his wife's funeral, in attendance also is his two sons, Mitch (played by brain Haley) and Steve (played by Brian Howe) he seems to have little or no patience for his own family, as they seem to have little feeling's for the loss of their mother, as their children are so spoiled. Walt has new neighbor's a family Hmong family from Korea. Which he has great hate for, since he was in the Koran war, and he seems to be an all out raciest. Walt's neighbors, a shy teenage Thao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang) tries to get into a Hmong gang and his initiation is to steal Walt's prize car, a 1972 Gran Torino. Walt's catches them in the act and points a rifle at Thao and that forces them all to run off. After a few days, Spider and his gang return to Thao's home, with his sister Sue at his side Thao manages to confront the gang and tell them that he wants no part of them. The gang then drags Thao off his porch and in attempts to beat him, while his family grandfather and all attempts to stop them. While in this assault they wrestle onto Walt's lawn and he then confronts them all with a rifle he had while serving in the army. He tells them to get off his lawn while pointing the rifle directly at the leader of the gang, Spider, which they then leave but tell Walt to watch his back. Walt soon has to rescue Sue, Thao's sister from a gang of blacks on the corner while they are harassing her with her boyfriend watching. Sue gets to know Walt and invites him to their family barbecue on his birthday. He soon realizes that he has more in common with this family then his own. Thao must work for Walt to pay for his attempt to steal his car and they soon grow very close as Walt shows the teenage Thao the way's of American men. Mean while the gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them but he keeps refusing and they go as far as assaulting his sister, and Walt then realizes that this family will not be safe until justice is served.The motif theme is this film is the racism and how soon we can realize how people are not that different then we are, and that when given a chance we can see that we are very much alike.This film is very similar to the film crash, how though out the film that racism dominates the characters and then they realize how they can be helpful to one another no matter what their race is. 0.1253094902513507\n",
      "Gran Torino (2008)Directed by Clint Eastwood, Written by Dave Johannson and Nick SchenkStarring Clint Eastwood, Christopher Charley, Bee Vang, and Aheny HerIn Gran Torino Clint Eastwood portrays Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran living alone after the death of his wife. The home they spent their life in sits in a neighborhood which has changed over the years and now is full of oriental emigrants. Walt is a gruff, angry, bigoted man alienated from his family and discussed by the people living around him. Enter Thao played by Bee Vang. Thao is a young man looking for his place in the world. Torn between what he thinks he should do and being pressured to join a street gang. His initiation is to steal Walt's prize 1972 Gran Torino muscle car. After Walt catches him, his family makes Thao work for Walt to pay him back for bringing dishonor to the family. Slowly over time Walt becomes involved with the lives of Thao and his sister Sue Played by Ahney Her. In the process Walt learns to overcome his bigotry, at least toward the people he has befriended. This involvement leads to him being at odds with the gang that wants Thao to join and the emotional climax of the film. The themes of overcoming generational racism in the case of Walt and that of finding ones place in society in the case of Thao are woven together to form a great story. Walt is a product of his time, he will always have his ingrained knee-jerk reaction to other races but on a small scale he is able to see the good in others when he is thrown in with them and comes to know them. He is a good man who lived his life in a society which routinely distrusted and disliked people of other races and national origins. Even with his ingrained feeling he still cannot just watch when Sue is accosted on the street by thugs. Thao is a young man looking for his place in a bad situation without a father figure to guide him. His unlikely bonding with Walt leads to him becoming a better person and tempering Walt's racist tendencies. I was really not interested in this film at first but after watching it I found that it an excellent film which was very relatable. I think most people have at least one Walt in their family. You can't make excused for them but you can understand why they are the way they are. 0.0974137931034483\n",
      "Gran Torino is a film based on the relationships that a retired Korean War veteran has that end up reforming his racist views. Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood is a widowed war veteran who is an angry man. He has troubled relationships with his sons and lives a solitary life with his dog named daisy. He lives in a neighborhood that is now populated with immigrants from the \"Hmong\" community that used to be an all white neighborhood. Walt does not hide his disdain for this recent development and vocally expresses his racists' views about it. He attends mass delivered by a young priest named Father Janovich played by Christopher Carly, who was friends with his deceased wife and often visits him. His neighbors are a Hmong family that includes two teenagers, Thoa a young boy played by Bee Vang, and Sue, Thoa's sister played by Ahney Her.The neighborhood gang confronts Thoa to steal Walt's Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation process. Reluctantly, he is unsuccessful in his attempt to steal the car and is apprehended by Walt. To make up for this attempted robbery, Walt makes Thoa do odd jobs in the neighborhood and begins to build a relationship with him, his sister, and family. The gang members attack Thoa for not stealing the car and Walt confronts one of them about this attack. They, in retaliation, rape Sue and do a drive by shooting at the family residence. To seek revenge, Walt tricks Thoa, locks him in his house, and subsequently arrives at the gang residence. Seeing that there are neighborhood witnesses, he confronts them and pretends to draw out a gun. They in turn shoot and gun Walt down. It is found out that Walt did not have a gun but instead drew out a cigarette lighter. The gang members are arrested and Walt leaves his Gran Torino to Thoa as he has saved his life.During the film, Walt discovers that he has lung cancer. This is important as it aides in his decision to be the savior for Thoa and his family in the end. Clint Eastwood does a fine portrayal of an angry racist man, a role that perhaps is different for him. In addition, the supporting casts all lend nice acting skills as their characters do not overshadow that of the main character but rather supports it. The evolution of Walt's growing affinity for the Hmong family is pleasant to watch and leaves a sense of joy yet remorse at the end of the film. Another film, American History X has similar undertones and is in par with the theme of Gran Torino. It depicts how intimate and developed relationships with opposite races help eliminate racists and stereotype views that people have.According to the online article Dearborn Classics (2010), \"the Ford Gran Torino were built tough and are remembered for their distinct style.\" This motif describes the theme of the film to a tee. Walt is a tough, no holding back man, and his actions at the end of the film will forever be remembered particularly for Thoa. Gran Torino then becomes an appropriate title for the film. In addition, the cinematography highlighted the theme of the film. It showed crisp sharp images and had a gritty color and texture to it. This was able to show the heaviness of the story lines and theme.Walt was able to transform himself, his thoughts, and actions by building a solid relationship with a young teenage boy and his family. It is the epitome of \"each one teaches one\" story and not buying into common stereotypes. We all have something to learn from other races and cultures no matter our own beliefs and ideas. 0.08449612403100776\n",
      "The film Gran Torino was an excellent example of both Clint Eastwood's acting and directing abilities. The movie is about Walt Kowalski, played by Clint Eastwood. He is a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran living in Detroit. The neighborhood he lives in has become mostly inhabited by low income Asian immigrants and is struggling with gangs taking over the neighborhood. Walt attempts to keep to himself, but is forced to face the reality of his community after his neighbor, a teenage Hmong immigrant, Thao Vang Lor, played by Bee Vang tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino. Thao is being pressured into joining a gang by his cousin Fong aka \"Spider\" played by Doua Moua. Walt saves Thao from being beaten up by the gang, and the two of them form a bond with the help of Thao's sister Sue, played by Ahney Her. As the story progresses, Walt helps Thao develop into a responsible adult and teaches him about life and love as he attempts to escape the pressures of gang life.One of the major themes of the film is prejudice and hatred towards different races, cultures and ethnicities. The neighborhood that Walt lives in used to be predominately white, working class families. Over time it has become a haven for low-income Asian immigrants, particularly the Hmong people. Walt is not a fan of these people, especially being a Korean War veteran. Throughout the movie he makes use of many different ethnic slurs, such as \"gooks\", \"zips\", and \"chinks\". He also constantly miss pronounces the name of the teenage girl Thao has a crush on, continuously calling her \"Yum-Yum\". Walt is set in his ways, and refuses to change, even though his neighborhood and the world as a whole is changing. In the movie he is forced to confront the changing ethnicity of his neighborhood, as well as the gang presence and influence in the neighborhood. Through his interactions with his Hmong neighbors, in particular Thao, he begins to take a softer view of these people. As the movie progresses he begins to have more of an understanding for different cultures, but as shown in the reading of his will, he never 100% changed, as he still utilizes ethnic slurs. The lighting in this film is really well done, and adds to the overall effect of the film. The use of lots of shadows to and low lighting makes the film more dramatic. The dark rough character of Walt is usually shown in dark lighting with lots of shadows. Whereas the young Asian teen who is going to \"show him the light\" is portrayed with bright lighting effects. Another important element to the film is the settings. The film was shot in parts of Detroit, Highland Park, Royal Oak, and Grosse Pointe Park Michigan. The scenes are very authentic to what you would expect to see in a low-income, heavy immigrant neighborhood. Without the proper scenery, the film would lose a lot of its authenticity.Overall I thought this was a good film, showing the prejudice, stereotypes and hatred still present in much of America. It has a similar theme and messages to the movie American History X, of acceptance and tolerance are better than hatred and prejudices just because someone is different then you are. 0.11597222222222224\n",
      "Mr. Miaggi and Mr kowalski need to get together for some beers, and then harass Danny, and Tao... Its a reverse twist of karate kid. Old white man takes in a young Asian boy and trains him the American way. Clint did good on this one. He always likes to make a serious note as to how horrible it is to kill people in his movies, while he always has an angry \"I want to kill you\" look. Hes a very Luke warm character, but his style makes up for it in many ways. Inspirational movie, but don't get too excited... This will definitely have a lot of criticism from various people. Its somewhat religious, somewhat anti religious, and it makes a fine example of common male sarcasm in the USA. Also, very good at bringing the differences between cultures and race together as one. This is one of the things America has an ongoing struggle with, and all the points made here is very much a reality in the USA. For Asians thinking of migrating to America, this would be my #1 recommendation for a movie to watch before you get here. The side of American culture you really need to see and understand (sarcasm), is expressed perfectly in this epic film. 0.14179012345679012\n",
      "There are numerous movies that come through theaters, but few have the quality of Gran Torino. Clint Eastwood brings a tremendous amount of depth and substance into this movie as he transforms from being a racist bigot who hates his Hmong neighbors to accepting them as his new family. Like a lot of Clint Eastwood movies, this movie is very heavy and deep. We do not have formulated and stereotypical roles like most movies, but a more artistic and brilliantly put together storyline.After watching this movie, one begins to develop different feelings for all of the characters as they become developed more, and the movie never falls into nameless stereotyping or formulated action/adventure clichés that all of the other films have. 0.10737689393939395\n"

      "You can watch this film as it is, as it presents before you; which is to say, with the audience appeal package that the story carries with it: -immigration in a contemporary view, facing western societies as an institution in transition, to the point that the once American way of life quite neighborhoods are occupied and relived by the families from once enemy countries. -The tense action promise that never unfolds but which carries the film. As entertainment, this is worth the ticket because we wonder about what's happening next, even if nothing ever really happens (in a physical graphic meaning). So it's a tense promise of action, that never ceases to be a drama in the end. Good genre play.You can place the film within the political views of Clint Eastwood, within the place that racial and gang conflicts assume in such suburban areas as the one in the film. one might want to see this as a \"political\" film, or as a \"socially concerned\" film.You can choose to watch the above, and consider other layers you may feel right. I want to see this film as a solid step in the work of Clint, the director. To me, this film is clearly one of the twilight of his career. Not because he's no longer young, but because this film is about clint's career as an actor as it is about his own cinema. That's why we have his own character as a parody of all his tough, intolerable cops and cowboys, from Leone to Siegel. The fun thing is how his character becomes his own anti character in the end. How the tough \"feel lucky punk\" guy ends up not being violent in order to beat the bad guys. That's certainly a twist which has more than the simple surprise of us getting the deceit while watching the film. I hope Eastwood lives on to make a dozen new films, but this film has the flavour of a quiet conversation between a filmmaker and his audience, like the late Kurosawa's or Welles, although Eastwood is pretty far from the magnitude of what those 2 achieved. But Clint's career sure is a vintage car, worth being driven and seen. It's not about performance, it's about commitment.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com 0.07326168663377967\n",
      "When the movie first starts Walt's wife had just died. His family shows up to the church where Father Janovich is conducting the funeral. Walt looks at his family who seems like they have better things to be doing than going to a funeral. Both of Walt's grandsons are on their phone and his granddaughter is wearing inappropriate clothing to be in a church or out in public for that matter. After the funeral everyone goes to Walt's house to have dinner with him. His family still wants nothing to do with him and the grandchildren are complaining that they are bored and want to go home. Walt is sick of hearing this so he goes out on the porch and his family leaves soon thereafter. Meanwhile next door, his neighbors are celebrating a birth of a young child and Walt mumbles under his breath that the old lady (grandma) hates his guts because every time Walt is out front she says something, that Walt cannot understand, and then just glares at him. A couple days later Thao was walking home from school when a non-Mung gang started harassing him. His cousin, who is in a Mung gang, drives up and makes sure that the other gang left his cousin alone. His cousin wanted him to go drive around with him, but Thao refuses and just goes home. A day later Thao was outside doing yard work when his cousin pulls up to the house. His cousin's gang told Thao that if he joined the gang he would no longer get picked on and that he could stop doing \"women's work\". Thao asked his cousin what he had to do to join the gang. They soon replied that Thao needed to steal Walt's car. Later that night Thao broke into Walt's garage and was trying to steal the Gran Torino when Walt hears the noises coming from his garage. Walt almost shoots Thao and Thao runs home and his cousin and the other gang member leave for the night. A couple of days later Susan, Thao's sister, was walking home with her so called date when a African American gang corners her and started harassing her when Walt drives by and see what is happening. Walt gets out of the truck and told Susan to get in his truck so he could take her home. The African Americans were not taking the hint until Walt pulls out his gun. Susan gets in the truck and Walt follows. When Walt was driving back he makes a gun out of his fingers and points to the African Americans and says, \"Pow, Pow, Pow.\" Showing the men that he is not afraid of him and they should start leaving other people alone. The pretend gun that Walt makes with his hands adds a sound effect that shows the mood that Walt feels at the time. A couple days after Walt takes Susan home, Walt ends up saving Thao's life when he gets in a fight with his cousin in their front yard. The next day the Mung people started bringing flowers, food, and misc. items and leaving them on Walt's door step. Thao's mother made him apologize for trying to steal the car; she also made him work off the debt to redeem the family honor. During this time Thao and Walt become friends and with Susan's help of dealing with and explaining their culture made Walt realize that they are not such bad people. Towards the end of the movie Thao and Susans cousin starts causing more problems. First Thao's cousin shoots up the house that they are living in and during the shooting someone raps and beats up Susan. By this point in time Walt was really upset! The Father came by and tried to talk Walt out of what he was about to do, but it was not going to work. The next day Walt goes to the church and makes omens with what he has done in the past, he then goes home and locks Thao in the basement. He heads over to Thao's cousin's house to take care of business, but on the way he calls Susan to let Thao out of the basement. (He knew that he was far enough away from the house that Thao and Susan would not make it there in time to stop him). Walt confronts Thao's cousin and the rest of the gang members by once again showing the pretend gun and making the same noise. He asks then men if they had a light after he pulled out a smoke, none of the men answered so Walt goes into his jacket and was pulling out a lighter when the gang shoots him dead on the side walk. The most memorable item on this scene is when they showed a bird's eye view of Walt laying on the ground.At the end Walt ends up dying and his family went to the funeral and then to the will reading. Because his family was so greedy on getting what Walt has, he left the house to the church and almost every other item to the church except for one item. He left the car to \"his good friend Thao\". The look on his family's face was priceless. With the end of the movie it reinforced that no matter how much money that one person has, it will never be the same as having your friend or your family member in your life. Money will not buy you happiness, but family and friends will be there for you no matter what happens in your life. Spend time with your family and quit worrying about how much of an inheritance you will receive when they are gone. Once they are gone, they will never come back! 0.09383753501400562\n",

Walt, now obsessed with solitude, wants nothing to do with them, and more importantly, to stay away from his front yard and all his property. Events take on various turns when Thao attempts to steal Walt's most precious property; his '72 Gran Torino.Walt's solitude results in developing a sense of prejudice and bigotry towards everybody, towards minorities, his local church's priest; Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), and his own family that he simply no longer stands. Walt's general attitude and behavior slowly changes, after engaging with a charming young girl that lives with her family next door to Walt; Sue (Ahney Her). Sue'; Thao's sister, takes an interest in socializing with Walt. Walt slowly learns and experiences the generosity and the commonality of his next door neighbors, of whom he despised so much earlier on. This results in a drastic and a radical change of attitude and behavior with Walt. Sue perceivably helps triggering Walt's humanity and goodness. He slowly adapts an entire different personality, to the point where he takes on a great interest in this family's affairs, of which becomes crucial when the family needed his assistance. He first takes on an interest in taking Thao under his wing. He teaches him discipline, and teaches him few things about mechanics and fixing things. Thao's central problem is the group of friends that he hangs out with. This issue only becomes more problematic, starting with Thao's attempt to steal Walt's Gran Torino, to the horrific sexual assault of Sue that angers Thao so much, that he wants to get revenge. Walt's central purpose in life becomes to avenge Sue, Taho, and their family of this group.In addition to the storyline that makes the viewer anxious about the events as they progress, many techniques are applied to further convey and persuade the audience to the movie. Angle shots are taken in a manner where certain scenes truly become memorable and make the movie more resonant, all of which this movie a must see. This movie challenges social norms that many people experience, but rarely ever confronted or addressed. Gran Torino confronts matters that pertain to prejudice, racism, bigotry, but most of all, it addresses human solidarity and common humanity that indeed exists in everybody. A two-thumbs-up film. 0.10492898913951546\n",
      "Is it me? Is there something wrong with me? I just don't get how Mr Eastwood gets so much praise. Well, this is the final death knell in my patience with Clintmania. I was holding out the last dregs of my hope for Gran Torino, thanks not only to very positive critical review but the recommendation of several friends whose opinion on these matters I respect.Well you all fooled me, congratulations. Not only does Clint excel in delivering another thoroughly one dimensional performance but the support cast (with the exception, I'll admit, of the girl who plays Sue) are no better. Of particular amateurish note is the kid who plays Thao, Clint's reluctant sidekick. Very rarely have I seen such an unconvincing character acted so unconvincingly.If you're a fan of Clint you'll probably like Gran Torino. If you're a fan of good storytelling, well-written dialogue, engaging plot and fine acting then you'd be better off steering clear of this overrated bore. Thanks again, Mr Eastwood. You unmade my day. 0.10994490358126724\n",
      "The film Gran Torino takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The main character is Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood.) Kowalski is an old man that is very set in his ways. He is a Korean War veteran and a retired factory worker. Walt is also a racist and overall, not a very loving man. The film starts with the death of Walt's wife and his general dislike of nearly everyone. When Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) sees Walt as a \"lost sheep,\" he tries to shepherd him back. Walt is as stubborn as a stubborn person can be. He thinks that his two boys are lazy and can't stand the lifestyle that his grandchildren live. He does not like people that are not white Americans and this becomes problematic as he lives in a part of Detroit that was once a prosperous part of town, full of hard working, white factory workers. Now, he is surrounded by poor, Asian people. He still harbors hatred towards Asian/Oriental people from his time in the Korean War.When Walt meets Thao Vang Lor(Bee Vang), it is under poor circumstances. Thao is a young and impressionable kid that is looking for something. He does not have a father figure in his life. He is influenced by the local gang and peer pressured into trying to steal the Ford Gran Torino that belongs to Walt. Walt catches Thao in the act and has him within the sights of his locked and loaded M-1 Garand.Walt does not shoot Thao. Thao's mother is grateful and makes Thao work for Walt in an effort to make things right. The two work together and develop a decent relationship. Neither of the two changes within their way of thinking about life, but they both seem to respect each other.When the local gang sees that they have failed in recruiting Thao, they become more violent. They kidnap and rape his sister. Thao is infuriated and wants revenge. Walt understands what it takes to kill a man. He is haunted from his Korean War experience and does not want Thao to have the same issues.Walt tricks Thao into his basement and locks him in to prevent him from seeing what needed to be done. Walt confronts the gang members and ultimately tricks them into shooting him when he is unarmed. This puts them all into prison without killing them. Walt seems to be at peace with this decision and ultimately gives his most prized possession to Thao.The lighting of this film is very important. The lighting seems to go towards the attitude of Walt. The beginning is dark and his wife just passed away. The middle is very bright and takes place during the day. This time is when Walt begins to like Thao. The ending of the film takes place at night and this is when Walt dies.The angle of the film is also very important. The view is shot from the same perspective. We are introduced to Walt early and often. He is not apologetic for the way he is. He simply is the way he is.The overall theme relates closely to The Karate Kid. The role of Walt and Mr. Miyagi is very similar. The role of Thao and Daniel is also very similar. 0.04146454320872926\n",
      "I have not lived in the US for 20 years and therefore I do not address the questions of racial conflict. The film is great first because the story is strong, and second because the acting is excellent. We see a character, Walt, transformed by his relationship with his neighbors, initially referred to as swamp rats. Walt comes to love them, especially Thao and Sue, and I think that development in the story is wonderful. He also reaches a conciliation with his priest, and his priest is transformed by their relationship. The situation and the change in Walt's character are the hallmarks of a good story and a good film. Gran Torino also is rare in that it can be watched repeatedly like the film \"In Brugges\". 0.4371794871794872\n",
      "Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching. 0.08472222222222221\n",
      "I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility. Too much, too brash, too over-the-top, too silly, too boring.Story not told well, whatever it was. I sure don't care. 0.09287518037518039\n",
      "Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (\"he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam\" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film. 0.12532894736842107\n",
      "Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible \"oh god\" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience \"It was all too Wet\" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the \"Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar\" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, \"But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?\" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, \"Ok this is Ok, were building towards something\", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself \"Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels\"😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage \"of Events\" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say \"oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....\"Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it. 0.18083847736625516\n",

      "The movie was quite enjoyable, albeit slightly too ambitious. It seemed to struggle in balancing between an aristocratic setting, lacking the depth found in works like 'Brideshead Revisited' or Alan Hollinghurst's 'The Line of Beauty', and a psychological thriller aspect, which, while entertaining, came across as overly sensational and somewhat lacking in credibility. At times, the plot developments were so outlandish that they were more amusing than serious. Saltburn was on the verge of being a masterpiece with its wealth of excellent content. It's still a worthwhile watch, despite some superficial elements and a feeling that Fennell and the screenwriter didn't fully explore their characters, choosing sensationalism instead. Quick's portrayal of a sociopath was intriguing yet not entirely convincing, but the film was still an enjoyable experience overall. It has more strengths than weaknesses. 0.3176470588235294\n",

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film. -0.12014824167601945\n",
      "I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

Maybe this movie wasnt designed to be a gay romance, but I have to say that i came with those expectations, and was wholly dissapointed when the main storyline simply moved on from Felix like he wasnt the main focus for so long... it just doesnt make a lot of sense to me.Rosamund Pyke was amazing, the whole cast was just 10/10, but the narrative... idk man. 0.19708333333333333\n",

Again, I never felt that.There is absolutely NO reason for Oliver to know that Felix would be so generous as to ingratiate him into his family by a flat tire ruse. The conceit of this entire film relies on the idea that Oliver is a grifter preying on this family and that someone would be kind enough to take him in. He sees what he wants, then has the shameless nature of approaching each one to gain favor. Honestly, one of the worse flip of the switch is when Oliver observes the sister of the household and seduces her (after a few words--saying she's a nympho doesn't make it so).Any way, Rosamund Pike is the only good thing about this flick.

My son had warned me that it's a bit 'full on' in places, so I wasn't sure what to expect.The well known story of poor, ugly student meets rich, aristocratic, drop dead gorgeous student played out with no obvious clues to where it was all heading. The plot takes a turn when privileged Felix realises Ollie has been lying about his family and his life was nothing like he had claimed. Events unfold and by the end of the film we see that Ollie is a nasty piece of work and very manipulative.A great cast with particular applause going to Rosamund Pike's performance as Elspeth. I was just sad to see that the brilliant Ewen Mitchell had such a small role.All in all, an entertaining film with a twist at the end. There are some very weird moments (I am thinking of the bath) and Barry Keoghan doesn't mind flashing his twinkie, so I would think twice before watching it with your parents/children! 0.06995614035087719\n",
      "Saltburn (2023) Cast: Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike, Richard E. GrantI have seen a lot, and I mean a lot of negative reviews for Saltburn on this website, and quite frankly I don't get the hate. True, I won't say it's perfect (although it is good enough to get seven stars from me) and I won't say I understand every directorial choice made by Fennell, (not to mention there were a few lines of dialogue that were cringe) but ultimately this had a really good story, good character, and most importantly really good acting, some of whom I probably wouldn't have given much thought of as far as their acting goes before this. So, please, give this movie an open mind when watching it. That doesn't mean you'll like it but at least you will have gone in with an open mind. 0.12976190476190477\n",

Every moment feels tense, rich, and dangerous. Seeing it in a theater full of Olds and Uptights was hilaaaarious.I just saw it hours ago, and if this movie was available for me to play again right now at home I would put it on again.

      "When it came to watching this film, it brought out a lot of mind tricks and plots on you. At first it starts of gradually normal and then as the film developed, it became more crazy and you couldn't figure out what could possibly happen after every possible moment, there was always a plot after another for an audience to be presented throughout the time of watching the film.Another thing about the film, I became interested in was, there was research into things to do with Latin, Greek Gods, and things like philosophy in order to get the characters of Oliver Quick, played by Barry Keoghan, and Felix Catton, played by Jacob Elordi. I think that's when everything started to come into place like the settings and where they filmed.With the film of Salt Burn, it was brilliant in the area of cinematography and the visuals. Everything was perfectly put in place and lived up to the audiences expectations. Apart from that, there was again those confusing moments where the audience gets confused. One of those scenes would be Oliver's lie about his father being dead and being rough with the sense of alcohol and drugs around when he's alive and the complete opposite or another scene like when Oliver is lying about not having any money and pretending to be poor.In the end, the audience finds out this film was here to confuse their audience. It separates itself from all other films because it's not something that other films would purposely do. This film comes off as strange but at the same time intriguing for an audience that they are trying to reach but at the same time it has it's comedic values to it and sympathetic and sad moments that their audience can relate to at certain moments of the film and can certainly relate. At the same time though, I do think there was some points in the film where some stuff wasn't needed and didn't make sense, especially when a lot of it is revolved around inappropriate things when they have a young audience and it rather didn't fit in with the rest of the film around it but at the same time, this film was made to be confusing to give an audience a different view of film and a new interest and that's what they did end up achieving in the long run.Another thing about this film, they casted ad directed this film brilliantly when it came to it. You can tell it's one of those films where they properly when into thoughts about everything and made sure every single small detail was taken into consideration. It's one of those films that you'd watch in the summer time due to it fitting that type of aesthetic but it's definitely not a film to watch around family and it doesn't fit into the family entertainment side of things. Its definitely one of those film where you'd watch it on your own if you are in summer time and need something to watch. 0.10718040462938423\n",
      "The acting and casting are terrific, but the character development leaves a lot to be desired. In its place we are given lots of gratuitous weird sex stuff.Take out the gratuitous sex stuff, and there's not much left. The plot has been done many times, and much better, especially in the old days of film noir where the character development added to the suspense.I'm sure certain types will call this art, but I call it lazy and pretentious. A plot this thin, especially with a very common story line, with such flimsy character development, would have been laughed out of any studio in better days. 0.008714285714285707\n",
      "He is just \"a human boy\".Emerald Fennell's \"Saltburn\" is an unforgettable, irresistible cinematic experience showcasing Barry Keoghan in his prime. Barry Keoghan gave not only his best but a career defining performance that will be remembered for years to come. The final scene of him will be seared in my brain for the foreseeable future (might even be forever). I adore Emerald Fennell's signature style, and after her directorial debut \"Promising Young Woman\" in 2020, I was eager to see what she comes up with next. \"Saltburn\" absolutely delivered the thrills, laughs, weirdness, sexiness, eeriness, and stylish personality that the first film encompasses but double downs on it tenfold. It is a very British psychological thriller with plenty of charm, youthful energy, and originality. The early 2000s aesthetic is lush and on point. I truly believe that this film utilizes the so-called 'eat the rich' narrative perfectly, and is easily the best film of that genre. The film is kind of a cross between Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" and Mike White's \"The White Lotus\". I need the film's soundtrack like yesterday. I have nothing but undying respect, gratitude, and praise for filmmaker Emerald Fennell. \"Saltburn\" is one of the best films of the year. Bravo to all involved, especially Emerald Fennell and Barry Keoghan.*At one point in the movie, Felix (Jacob Elordi) says what everyone is thinking: \"I'm so effing hot.\" If Jacob Elordi showed even the slightest interest in me, I too would be driven mad with love.Final verdict: 10/10. 0.21881720430107526\n",
      "This is a film that some won't understand. It is brilliant in its subversive bookending, a beautiful satire while a character study that keeps you wondering.Psychosexual and that keeps you guessing? Yes. But if that's your problem you're missing the point.EF's second feature has built upon her first \"revenge tale\" in the excellent Promising Young Woman (an absurdly simplistic genre attribution) and in her second has delivered a more complex protagonist's journey that left me going WOW.Second time round better once you know the narrative. But for first watchers: Listen, watch, hear. Then rewind and don't take what you saw for granted when you watch that last scene... 0.19705882352941176\n",
      "While I reflected on 'Saltburn', an unexpected song came to my mind: Hole's 'Doll Parts' (...yes, I know, but bear with me here); specifically these verses:\"They really want you, they really do/Yeah, they really want you/They really want you, and I do tooI want to be the girl with the most cake/I love him so much it just turns to hate/I fake it so real I am beyond fake/And someday, you will ache like I ache.\"These words, oddly enough, epitomize the protagonist: this is very much Oliver's mindset throughout the film. The idiom \"to have one's cake and eat it too\" (which is somewhat referenced in Hole's lyrics) feels particularly relevant here, because Oliver's all-consuming fixation on Felix's family transcends greed and combines it with a strange, unbridled gluttony; a desire to possess, yes, but also to consume Felix, his relatives and his wealth, to make them part of him somehow. He won't be sated until he's had it all.At one point in the film, a character-Venetia-accuses Oliver of having eaten Felix up and licked the plate, and that couldn't be closer to the truth. He is a self-proclaimed vampire, and he is set on a path to devour Felix for all he's worth.This film was a fascinating and visually stunning take on love-albeit a kind of love that veers straight into heavily obsessive territory. The lush imagery, combined with a screenplay rife with clever quips and absurd one-liners, sets a backdrop of eccentricity and decadent wealth. And then Oliver's character, masterfully played by Barry Keoghan, comes to disrupt the titular estate's murky, contrived peacefulness.The soundtrack is also worth a mention, as it does a fine job of evoking an authentic 00s ambience and complementing the atmospheric, immersive cinematography.All in all, I would absolutely recommend 'Saltburn'; the plot may not be terribly unique, and the ending is hardly surprising if you follow the context clues, but that does not detract from the experience provided by the film. Sometimes, making artful use of well-worn tropes is worth far more than relying on unpredictability-'Saltburn' is one of those cases. 0.23523148148148149\n",
      "Saltburnis a visually stunning piece, showcasing meticulous attention to aesthetics. The narrative, while intriguing, follows a familiar path akin to \"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\" However, the film takes an unexpected turn with controversial and disturbing scenes that appear disconnected from the plot, seemingly inserted for shock value. These moments feel forced, leaving one to question their necessity and correlation with the overarching story.Despite the film's undeniable visual appeal and a compelling narrative, the inclusion of these shocking scenes raises concerns about their intent. It appears more a ploy for attention than a genuine exploration of societal norms, potentially alienating younger or conservative audiences.The end of the movie looks also disconneted from the rest and leae us with several question marks. In essence, while Saltburn has its merits, the discordant elements prevent it from fully justifying the hype. 0.10156250000000001\n",
      "Saltburn moves along at a good pace, rather stylish and hip as it creates some anticipation for where it may be going. It develops a bit of mystery but we never understand the motivation for the protagonist character. Not much depth for the various character, so can't get invested in them. Several scenes are designed to depict ridiculous opulence and wealth, so as to contribute to why the main character has disdain for this, yet we don't ever feel this disdain.As the end approaches it becomes predictable while it quickly and conveniently fills in the holes of whatever mysteries it tried to create. Overall, Saltburn lacks substance and hence I was left feeling with the lack of meaning for whatever message the film is trying to depict. 0.09696969696969694\n",
      "The first half looks like a comedy and you don't think about some kind of blackie. But the further you go, the more interesting it gets. In the end, it's a kind of psychological drama, and the finale is a black comedy.Another example of a movie about which the less you know, the more interesting it is to watch.I would like to highlight the music, the way the film was shot and the final twist, which consists of 6 elements: two of which I knew about, two were under suspicion and two turned out to be unexpected! From this I conclude that exactly half of the final turn, for me personally, turned out to be unexpected. And it made me happy! 0.21096491228070177\n",
      "It's one of those movies that is so well made it makes up for any narrative shortcomings. It's got a vibe of A24 horror like Midsommar but doesn't deliver at all on that, hints of Great Gatsby but doesn't on that, Romeo and Juliet, it feels like a lot better movie than it is. It kept me wanting to know how it would end but the ending was pretty unsatisfying, really it is one of those movies with an interesting message but a wholy unsatisfying outcome. It is worth watching for Barry Keoghan though, this is his 'Bronson' before he plays the Joker. He has the whole film on his shoulders and he carries it effortlessly. Is it a good movie though?

I'll start by saying this movie has things I've never seen before in a movie. Nothing too graphic, but some very, very weird stuff. It's also artistically beautiful, and very subtle at times (it reminds me of White Lotus; if you liked that, you'll probably like this).

      "These days it's hard to find a movie that really leaves the theatre with you. I love going to the movies but when I leave, the movie stays. It's good, it's fun. But Saltburn was a film that really stuck with me after my first viewing. So much so, that I ended up watching it like 4 more times that month. So here are my thoughts.This movie had an amazing soundtrack, good pacing, gorgeous visuals, vibrant colors, an incredible cast, great costume design, and a knowing, confident visual language. I loved how all these elements contributed to the story, and making this a period piece was just genius. It had this energy about it (probably brought in mostly from Jacob Elordi and his aura) that just made it all so exciting. That's why it was such a spectacle to see it all come crashing down in the third act.That being said, I felt like the reveal was probably tooting its own horn a little too hard. We had already established Oliver's strange behavior, and while it was surprising to backtrack and see his \"master plan\", it was a little ridiculous to see how perfectly things fell into place for him. But I still loved his whole reveal. And the incredible dance at the end. That looked so therapeutic.After coming away from the movie and having time to sit on it, I'd say that even though I've read so many people saying this movie is too pretentious or a tumblr treasure trove, I say we let a good movie speak for itself. This is such a creative and fun movie that I'd highly recommend, cinephile or not.Also, Barry Keoghan absolutely killed this role. What a little freak. 0.2974870801033591\n",
      "What shocks me more than the ending and even the infamous bathtub scene is the fact that a calculating heinous murderer is the most beloved character in this film.Apparently, the hatred of the super-rich is so fierce that we applaud Ollie to the point that the horrible, graphic, murder of the one person who truly brefriended him is met with a sigh of relief and almost cheers as their \"working-class hero\" FINALLY achieves his ultimate goal.Masterfully performed by Barry Keoghan, Ollie becomes someone we all identify with on some level. The somewhat shy, plain-looking lad whose mother was a craven druggie and whose father dies (or so we thought) who is befriended (somewhat begrudgingly) by an ultra rich classmate. We feel his pain, his embarrassment, his longing for something more. And his confusion. But why is he confused? Does he really have a soul and is capable of feeling guilt or is his plan just NOT going along as he wants. Is it guilt or frustration.This is a phenomenal move. Well directed and very well acted. I loved it even though it gave me the creeps on a level I can't quite understand. 0.12083333333333332\n",
      "I went into this knowing nothing, and at one point it reminded me of Jordan Peele's Get Out, and also Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract: A guy goes to stay with some very rich people, and the atmosphere is bizarre and creepy.The early part of the film is promising, and the middle is quite good. The social subtext is subtle and cutting, the characters are well defined and well acted, and I had no idea what kind of movie it would turn into.Where it goes after that is just kind of trashy and unsatisfying. This kind of thing has been done better in movies that I can't name without a spoiler.

      "Saltburn has got a lot of noise and publicity around it and indeed it looks good but after that not much can be said in its favour.. Fundamentally it's pretty derivative, the characters are quite thin and need fleshing out with the main protagonists relationship being utterly unbelievable. There is just no good reason why they become \"friends\". Indeed the plot takes a few contrived twists that don't really bear up to any close scrutiny before the film ends with a 2 minute explanation of the plot for anyone who wasn't paying attention or couldn't infer anything. This feels like it's poor compensation for the deficiencies in the filmmaking itself. The writing seems half baked and nobody took a critical step back to say this is just nonsense, albeit glossy nonsense. -0.075\n",

If you have a problen with depictions of body fluids this might not be your film. If you can stomach it then you're in for some sticky fun.It also is a nice slice of milenium nostalgia with a great sound track The last scene of the movie has a perfect song choice and leaves you feeling a bit confused as you're still processing what you've seen while you want to dance out of the theater. 0.29\n",

      "There is a lot to unpack with this film. Beginning with the main character, Oliver Quick, whose personality is drab and generally unlikeable. I understand that this is the point, and that the only reason he is at all interesting as a character is due to the lies he tells and his somewhat inconsistent motivations. I had assumed, in the beginning, that Oliver's obsession with Felix is due to him falling in love with him or having a crush. This belief was somewhat corroborated by his actions (such as the infamous bathtub and graveyeard scenes). It is entirely possible that this was the case, and Oliver only killed Felix and his family due to his lies crumbling apart and Felix learning the truth. Oliver clearly fell in love with the lifestyle that Felix and his family had at Saltburn and when it became clear that Felix was cutting him out of his life for lying to him, Oliver clawed desperately at any chance to keep this lifestyle, leading him to kill his only friend.I enjoyed the aspect of having to put together the pieces to understand the whole story, and my interpretation may not be correct, as of course there are some inconsistencies with Oliver's motivations, especially towards the end. I also have to make a point that the actors in this film are incredible and portray their characters in a way that is believable and realistic.I did however find this film to be a bit slow, and dialogue heavy. Most of what this film relies on is the shock value of many of its more R rated scenes. These scenes of course received a lot of attention online, and were what hyped this film up so much. I probably would not have watched it if it were not for the hype, and these scenes that were so overly hyped where rather tame. (I may be a poor judge on this due to having been chronically online as a child and having read many disturbing fan-fictions online).Beyond these points, the ending is a bit unbelievable as you have to believe that he could get away with killing all of these people and somehow gain their inheritance without anyone catching on. Not a single person questions Felix's or Venetia's deaths or makes the connection that Oliver is in the middle of this tragedy (Someone would make the connection that suddenly the family members are dropping like flies and Oliver is the only new thing in their lives). And Elspeth's motivations for keeping Oliver around after her entire family is dead is so strange, besides why she would make him the sole beneficiary of her inheritance. She only knew him for a couple months before her family died, it's not like she had a close connection with him.Overall, it's a bit confusing how everything plays out in the end. There are a few loose ends and questions that remain unanswered, which prevents this film from rating higher than a 6/10. 0.042194225527558867\n",

The Farleigh character was sometimes a bit too cruel for me though- which somehow took away the believability a little.It was a tiny bit predictable in that it was obvious towards the end that he was bumping them off - but the twist was that he'd been plotting to do it since before he even first encountered Felix. This explains all the lying about his family - to set Felix and his family up so he would win them over.It wasn't explained what happened to Elspeth in the end ... which is a pity (because I like things neatly tied up, thankyou very much).V. good.81/100. 0.030416666666666682\n",

It wasn't a ripoff either, just different enough.2) I'm not sure why Carey Mulligan is getting so much attention - she was barely in it. I love her, but it was little more than a cameo.3) The pacing was really good - editing 1014) The only real problem was the lighting, as if the director loved The Batman and wanted to copy the nearly incomprehensibly dark scenes.5) The ending was rushed, but necessary. It didn't need another 30 minutes.6) A nitpick about the story - too much of the end depended on a lot of things happening that may not have happened.

I rather enjoyed peeling back the layers from each of the characters portrayed in this show. The study of how human relationships dance in the shadows of envy, pride, ego and hatred and bask in the glow of joy, friendship, brotherhood and love at other times. It is a complex and nuanced story that makes you question to plot often. I am not sure I was in love with the ending but also feel it is a story I would have wanted to get acquainted with regardless. Watch it on a quiet and contemplative evening for best results. 0.3236111111111111\n",
      "This is the first film I've watched by Emerald Fenell so I didn't know what to expect. I went in this film totally blind (though I think I shouldn't have) and suprisingly I enjoyed it.Though, quite provocative through its provocative and sometimes uncomfortable scenes, I found the film utterly captivating from start to finish. In my opinion its a great film that transports you through its smart and intricate writing. Brillant performances by the actors, I mean that dinner scene around the end of the film was just breathtaking. The film is so compelling with a lot of twist and turns that keeps you hooked from beginning to end and i have to acknowledge the amazing cinematography in this film. It's just beautiful and visually stunning.So overall, even though this film isn't for everyone I'd recommend to give it a try. 0.26441326530612247\n",
      "One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver has neither wit nor allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end. -0.08066666666666666\n",
      "Achievement unlocked-I've experienced Saltburn. The moment is a culmination of anticipation and finality. Saltburn was a captivating journey that exceeded my expectations.Captivatingly beautiful and hauntingly dark, this film weaves a complex tapestry of hedonism, troubling obsessions, and the stark divide between the haves and have nots. It explores themes of obsession, possession, and repression, deftly navigating the intricate dance between comedy, drama, tragedy, and cautionary tale. Every frame is a testament to brilliant cinematography, blending vibrant colors with a pervasive darkness that mirrors the film's thematic depth.While some may focus on its erotic elements, they seamlessly intertwine with the narrative and the nuanced characterization of the central figure. Far from gratuitous, the film uses eroticism as a lens to explore the lengths, depravity, and boundless ambition that drive individuals to extremes in pursuit of their desires.At its core, the main character stands as an enigmatic outlier, and a dangerous one at that, challenging societal norms and defying explanation. The film forces viewers to confront the unsettling reality of a person who exists beyond the comprehension of both themselves and society-a disturbing and thought-provoking aspect that lingers long after the credits roll.Undoubtedly, the final dance number at the film's conclusion deserves a place in the annals of cinema history as one of the most iconic dance sequences ever crafted. Its sheer brilliance and choreographic mastery left an indelible imprint, making it a dazzling crescendo that resonates long after the credits roll. Damn, it was a cinematic dance spectacle that transcended the screen, etching itself into the collective memory of all who witnessed its artistry.In the realm of art house cinema, this film stands out as a masterfully executed piece, a quadfecta of genres seamlessly blended into a profound cinematic experience. It pushes boundaries, challenges perceptions, and leaves an indelible mark as one of the finest offerings in contemporary art house filmmaking. 0.16036036036036033\n",
      "This is one long film at more than two hours, and I'm not sure the content quite justifies the length. As you no doubt know by now, it's about a seemingly normal everyday youth intruding on an aristocratic family during his University break, and the effect he has on their lives during 'one unforgettable summer', as Amazon describes it. Hmm.There are quite a lot of scenes here that initially seem interesting but outstay their welcome, and a few cringe moments in term of sexual content I could've done without. The acting is universally good and everything escalates rather fast to tie together nicely in the end... I'm just not sure I'd see it a second time, that's all.Oh, and if you're wondering why 'Murder On The Dancefloor' is currently climbing the charts, it's because of the climax where the main actor Barry Keoghan... well, that would be telling, but sufficed to say it all seemed a bit unnecessary to me.And if you really wanted to stream the song based on this movie...

The acting is on the money apart from a couple of scenes, but the casting was inspired. Mr Grant, whilst not being given a huge amount of screen time, was excellent, as was Ms Pyke, but Keoghan stole the show. As the darkness bagan to make itself known, you are dragged along with it but what a ride. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it but it totally got me hooked.

      "A strange one. Oliver (Barry Keoghan who looks like a young John Hurt) is attending Oxford University in the UK. He's shy and withdrawn. Then he meets outgoing, charasmatic Felix (Jacob Eldordi) and they become friends. Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer at his huge estate with him and his family. However his family is heavily dysfunctional and things get out of control. It all leads to an incredible twist ending that I didn't see coming. It's well-made and the acting is good. However it's slow-moving and the thick accents render some of the dialogue unintelligible. Still I give it a marginal recommendation. 0.11666666666666667\n",
      "It's quite insane, and I love it. I don't entirely agree with the comments suggesting that \"Oliver is money-sexual.\" His meticulous design from the beginning is to get close to Felix, creating a connection beyond the distant and almost pitiful distance between the prince and the dark corner.It seems similar to \"Genius Loci,\" but there are subtle differences in emotional depth and direction. The male lead in Genius Loci wants to become the second male lead, live the second male lead's life, secretly wear his clothes and shoes when the second male lead is not at home - desires surpassing mere infatuation.Oliver is different. He enters Oxford, glimpses Felix through the window surrounded by a courtyard crowd, and falls deeply in love with him at first sight.Oliver is an outsider, an oddity, despite being intelligent and diligent-reading fifty books in one summer, writing a substantial thesis, knowledgeable, yet unable to win the affection or even much attention from classmates.He knows what type of person Felix would be interested in, understands what roles his middle-class background (actually, upper-middle class) allows him to play. The roles with the highest chance of success, the scripts most likely to secure friendships - he grabs them all.A significant part of Oliver's infatuation with Felix is due to Felix's privileged background. It's the upper class that can nurture someone like Felix - carefree, handsome, and charming. Easily garnering affection from everyone at parties, pointing out the most beautiful girls, a comprehensive abundance in both material and emotional aspects.Oliver might lament the lack of love for him, while Felix frets over too much love from others.Felix's sympathy for the weak is his virtue, a trait Oliver exploits. This kindness seems pure but also like an aloof upper-class person observing a human tragedy from a distance - akin to an audience enjoying a spectacular death in a horror movie, sighing with a mix of sympathy and satisfaction.But Pamela, Oliver, and the briefly mentioned \"Eddie from last summer,\" each one of them is vividly alive.Felix and his mother squeeze stories out of their \"friends,\" just like losing interest in a once-beloved movie after repeated viewings. The \"friends,\" along with their luggage, are sent away by the loyal butler at night or in the morning, never disturbing the master's enjoyment of solitude.Oliver's infatuation with Felix deepens time and again. It's inevitable. Despite having money in his wallet, he pretends not to when paying the bill. Though he's 80% sure Felix is aware of his predicament, when Felix actually walks over, pays for him, and adds, \"I found the money you dropped on the ground,\" to save face in front of the bartender, Oliver is genuinely relieved.When it's good, it's genuinely good, like the radiant sun finally noticing the weeds growing in the corner and generously bathing them in warm light. The warmth is so comforting that, having experienced it once, you never want to go back to the damp, sunless corner.Oliver wants to be Felix's friend, a good friend, preferably invited to live in the dreamy castle forever.When Felix's cousin mocks him, saying, \"Living in the castle is a dream for you, something you can only reminisce about in the future. But for me, this is my home, and I can return anytime.\"What is Oliver thinking? Probably that even if it's a dream, he wants to replace reality with it, to be intoxicated in this dream for a long, long time.He doesn't plan to tell children the story of that summer on a recliner decades later. He wants to plunder the master of this dream, deviously stealing the authority to dream.What if Felix forgives him, responds to this love, even if it's just a little, forgiving his deception, letting him stay in the castle? It's an ideal and perfect scenario that shatters. Only plundering, only treacherous acts remain. He kills the love that won't stay and trades it for a castle that can only be guarded in place.Crazy love, crazy infatuation. I wonder, what if Felix forgives? What if he responds to this love?This is a direction untouched by both \"Genius Loci\" and this movie, and a direction that could never be explored. If it did, it might turn into... an original BL story?Haha. 0.1931936358660496\n",
      "I was pretty excited when Saltburn was announced. The clips I saw interested me very much and everything about it seemed intriguing to me. I would've loved to see it in theaters of course, but sadly it didn't release in my country. Now having finally watched it, I can say that it was certainly a fun watch but it was predictable for me and some scenes felt like they were over the top just to be over the top, for no reason really. Of course you could say it was because they wanted to add shock value, but then again there was no shock value. Maybe it was because I watched the movie at home but the \"shocking scenes\" were all just kind of silly to me. It all felt a bit too pretentious to me and as if they were actively trying to be as different and unpredictable as possible, which of course resulted in the movie being predictable. Needless to say I still had a good time watching it, the cinematography was great and I liked the acting. Venetia confronting Oliver was a really well done scene. I'd say this movie had much more potential and for me it kind of fell short in the end. It didn't make me feel much. Fun watch, 6/10 for me. 0.1343939393939394\n",

It's been about a week since I watched it, and I'm still having random thoughts where I'm questioning why Oli did what he did. Even though we get to see at the end that he'd meticulously planned the whole charade, it still doesn't answer the \"why?\". Was murder the plan all along, or was he driven to it once Felix discovered the lies about Oli's family?I may be in the minority of people that didn't catch on to Oliver's lies in the beginning. It wasn't until I saw the switcheroo at the castle that I had my \"oh sh**!\" realization.The period scene was weird. The grave scene even more weird. The ending dance scene (which made me chuckle) was another bit of weird. None of those things made the film hard for me to watch, and I enjoyed the acting throughout.

It then rushes through the 3rd act where the body count stacks up so quickly it doesn't have time to be impactful.

It's well directed and acted. It just doesn't add anything new to the aforementioned \"sociopath infiltrates rich family\" story.Oliver is a shy student at Oxford U who befriends Felix, a handsome classmate who comes from a rich family. During the summer, Felix invites Oliver to stay with him and his family--who seem to be so rich that they have absolutely no idea how to relate to people--during the summer. As is the case of most of these movies, everything's fine at first, but then things get dark real quick.I figured out Oliver was a sociopath midway through the movie, so the big \"twist\" at the end didn't surprise me.

To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

And it was one I would make again. If I had gotten to this point in my life without having seen Swiss Army Man, then I would be able to say this is the strangest film I've seen. Under these circumstances, it is just shy of that, and not by much. It's been a long time since I've walked out of a film without a few gripes and groans, but this one finally silenced me.First beginning as a tale of a poor college student, Oliver (Barry Koeghan), developing feelings for a handsome, well off classmate, Felix (Jacob Elordi), of his at Oxford University and desperately trying to be liked by him, changes its mold into an admittedly odd and quite bold will-they-won't-they summer of pining when Felix invites him to spend the summer at his family home in Saltburn, Edinburgh.The lavish and exciting surroundings bring out different sides of the two main characters as they unpeel and reveal more to one another, despite having little in common to begin with. Both the meeting of Felix's outlandish and alarmingly capricious parents and sister and the developments in his own family members' lives, change Oliver's life and he becomes a version of himself he's never been able to achieve before, for better or for worse.During this act of the movie, it settles into something similar to Call Me By Your Name, in its vintage dreamscape of an offline and outdoor European summer oasis. Though sporting a few unexpectedly dubious scenes, it doesn't fall apart all at once. Slowly, and through a great deal of effort, Oliver starts to feel more at home in Saltburn. The only person standing in his way, is Felix's cousin, Farleigh, whom he resents deeply and even does his best to get rid of after a particularly nasty karaoke attack.The ambush targets Oliver's ego in a particularly deadly way that disastrously impacts Felix's family in ways Farleigh could've never expected.

I see what they wanted to do with this one but it didn't really work out for me. At first i just enjoy the premise of all the different people meeting at university and later the more time they spend at the estate, the more they wanted this summer to last forever - but with a dark undertone. I even enjoyed the awkwardness from time to time, but at some point it was just getting weirder without the characters getting any depth within the development of the story. At some point i already knew where it was going and wasn't shocked at all about the MC slowly going insane and killing off the whole family. I was rather annoyed they made him such a perv instead of a mastermind, getting what he wants because of manipulation and choosing murder only when its necessary (i only \"understood\" the murder of Felix, because their relationship was heading to rock bottom and he was indeed able to stop Oliver from his plan, in theory). Now the way they actually wrote Oliver in the film, he didn't feel any like this, and it's definitely not on the acting side. I felt the writing being absolutely off even while watching it. I had a feeling someone came up with this story, who actually spend most of their time in the rich society, on similar estates and imagined for their monotone life to get a little kick start which could bring all this (hypocritical) happiness into danger but never really gave it any deeper thought. They never really made up specific and unique characters, which were more than their 2 personality traits. Even if it was the idea to show how easily certain people can be exchanged for another one or just can be brushed away by the family, to show how arrogant and hypocritical they are, it felt like a decision made by the writing, and not because of the features the family has. And this is just an example for so many moments in this film. But i don't want to end this on the negative side, so something they did really well here: the vibe constantly holding a good level of \"everything seems to be perfect but there is something uncomfortable and dark in the air\". Over all, a cake without a filling, which still has a nice taste and glaze tho. I don't regret watching it but i would not recommend it to someone else to watch it. 0.11025381850853548\n",
      "Ok so I admit it was all the hype about Murder on the Dancefloor revival splashed all over instagram which spurred me to watch this film which takes you down the rabbit hole all the way. No spoilers here what I suggest is skip the reviews and watch this with an open mind. All the star actors give a strong performance's particularly Oliver whose character is indeed malevolent at best, macabre and diabolical at worst. Honestly one of the most refreshing movies I've seen in a while and something which epitomizes the 2000s at its surreal money on a wheel best. So give it a go and hang on to the crescendo at the end with Sophie Ellis Bextor, it's more that worth the killer wait! 0.25796296296296295\n",

What was his motivation? Just the house? If so, how did he find that house? Did he go to Oxford as a part of his plan?And when it comes to Oliver's love (or desire?) for Felix, I felt like the movie didn't explore that part enough (which, for me, was a central one). Did Felix feel the same for him?And what about all that sexual obsession Oliver had over Felix? Never explored.The storyline could've been way better, way deeper, way more developed. 0.16363636363636364\n",

He quickly realizes that the game at Oxford is rigged: Since provenance is a decisive factor not only in the evaluation of the students but also in their social recognition.Different to the majority of the students who conform to their role in the social class system, by distracting themselves by social activities, Oliver is bored by them.To cross social and class boundaries, he uses dubious means to become Felix, whom \"he loves\" - but is \"not in love with.\" Felix is a charming human being, but remains member of the aristocratic class. His family exhibits a ruthlessness to all people dependent on them. That however, can Oliver match easily. 0.13187499999999996\n",
      "I loved Emerald Fennell's A Promising Young Woman. It was one of my favorite films of 2020 and I absolutely thought she deserved the Oscar for her original screenplay. So I had high hopes for Saltburn. And early on, they were met. Great performances, witty writing. And I liked the dark comedy. But this film so de-evolved and became so ridiculous, I couldn't wait for it to end. By that point, I pretty much hated the film. The second half of the movie felt to me like a self-indulgent, incredibly contrived orgy. And not the fun kind. More the kind of orgy where it's 5:00 AM, and you just want to go home and take a shower. The best word to describe Saltburn: Ick. 0.23630434782608697\n",

If you're happy to watch a shallow movie then sure, watch Saltburn. Dialogues are cringey and way over the top towards unbelievable. The only saving grace is the beautiful scenery and stage set ups.The pace did pick up at the end, and there were some interesting scenes - however it felt like the director was getting desperate to save the movie and pulling out all sorts of last ditch efforts to leave an impression. Still, it did not make it bearable and the only impression I was left with was - what a waste of my night. 0.11904761904761905\n",
      "So many Shakespeare references it's not even funny; also the bathtub scene is not as bad as everyone says. The grave scene is like 10x worse... very experienced cast, several weird little freak moments, and a beautifully disguised plot. The whole storyline pivots in one particular scene into an entirely different story. What starts off as an offbeat coming of age story turns very quickly sour and demented, and frankly quite disturbing to watch. Many moments left me in a state of utter disbelief as to what I just watched. Some were so strange that an audible \"what?!?!\" erupted from just about everyone in the room. In summary, very gorgeous movie for those with a bit more complex taste. I wouldn't recommend it for those who enjoy simple plots with nothing that hides under the surface. 0.08171006944444446\n",
      "I've heard about this movie on Tiktok, never a good start but I decided to give it a watch anyways. The first half an hour was a rush and filled with cliches; sad looser meets rich popular boy. What could've been a great start for the rest of the movie and could have established the relationships of the characters came to short and relies on the watcher already being familiar with these clichés. For me it got really interesting after that; the actors managed to beautifully and realistically portray these people in the second part, but sadly then again the third act lay low. In act two, interest was build up but the movie just never came to any sort of climax. After the characters find out The-Dramatic-Secrets, it feels like nothing happens. Still, the movie had it's great scenes. I enjoyed how they dared to try things, the nude scenes really managed to make the viewer uncomfortable. Furthermore, the actors were incredible. Before this movie, I've only known Jacob Elordi from movies like 'the kissing booth' and made the mistake to not differentiate between actor and character, because although he's still a popular guy in this role, he managed to portray a beautiful new and naive character, but also Berry Keoghan had his stunning scenes, as disgusting as they were, they were absolutely stunning. Another thing I greatly appreciated was the way the movie was filmed; soundtrack, camera work and cuts were used gracefully and made the movie feel kind of timeless. Overall I think it's a great movie, but I would not recommend it to most people. You've got to have an interest in seeing people naked and not have a problem with secondhand embarrassment. 0.21721380471380472\n",

I found two seems troublesome especially looking backward after the ending, and they only seemed to be there to shock.Would I rush to watch it again, no, would I watch it with my parents in the room, no. Would recommend it to a friend, yes I may well.

I thought the casting was very good, some of the characters were perfectly played by the actors -- great choices there. I especially liked Elspeth (Felix's mother) -- her ability to shift from one state to another, all the while keeping her cool and unemotional facade -- was very good.Oliver -- my goodness, he was beyond creepy. The actor did a really good job in that role, again for his ability to shift from one state to another. I realize it took me a while to see that \"gotcha\" moment when you realize what he was up to all the time, but maybe I'm just slow.I would recommend it, but a lot depends on your mood for this sort of movie.

      "No one who has seen either Plein Soleil (Purple Noon) or The Talented Mr. Ripley (or read the book on which they are based) can possibly watch Saltburn without concluding during the final act that the big zinger was lifted directly from Patricia Highsmith's oeuvre. In fact, she may well have a short story along these lines. I would be surprised if she did not.The cinematography is excellent. I do not regret having watched this film, but it is quite far from being great. It's a bit of a bait-and-switch in the sense that two-thirds of the film pretends to be a critique of class inequities. Then along comes the ending, when we come to learn the truth. Nothing was as it seemed. It's not about inequity but iniquity! 0.3\n",
      "Do not waste your money on Saltburn. Instead watch Moliere's Tartuffe at a theatre, or read the case of the French aristocratic family scammed by Thierry Tilly - which are obvious borrowings in this unoriginal mish-mash of a film. This reminds of what Laura Neal did in bad writing to finale 'Killing Eve'. It betrays the audience, is badly written, and poorly made - it talks down to the audience and mocks any investigative law enforcement. Visually it looks good, but it is a silly romp that does not satisfy, the characters are two-dimensional, and the occasional insight is swiftly blunted. There is no brilliance here - only an overpaid, overrated maker either losing it, or saying 'F... You' to cinema-goers. Don't waste your time. Filmed at Shotover Park fits - for a lazy shot in the dark that fails cinema. -0.16975308641975306\n",
      "This movie is dumb. It seems the director was going for shock value and trying to cram in as many shocking scenes as possible.This movie isn't twisted, it's absolutely disgusting and I'm not sure what the message here is. Saltburn makes zero sense, he wanted a friend and from the beginning someone tried to befriend but he ignores him and tries to befriend another only to destroy him and his family.I gave this movie a single star, because I went in blind, hoping for a nice entertaining story but came away positively disappointed and disgusted. Pointless drama, no redeeming values, zero logic.Don't believe the positive reviews it is not a positive movie, at all. -0.238568010936432\n",
      "What makes Saltburn most effective in the first two-thirds are the characters, with well-rounded performances given by Barry Keoghan and the aristocratic family he admires, specifically Alison Oliver and Jacob Elordi. His interactions with family members show envy and desire begin to blur, and you wonder about the characters' underlying motives. The dynamic between Felix (Jacob Elordi) and Oliver (Barry Keoghan) is most evident of this, with queer subtext that made me anticipate where the film was going with their relationship.Then, in the last act, the movie falls flat on its face. It becomes bloated and drawn-on, and the character development that drew me in amounts to nothing. In an effort to feel clever and subvert audience expectations, Emerald Fennell writes in a \"twist\" that undoes most of what was interesting about the film. As a result, its message is muddled and ultimately without substance. Killing off nearly all of your good characters to set up a boring James Bond villain-esque monologue where the main character reveals he *planned* all of this is so so lazy and ridiculous. Not only does it raise many questions of logic but it solidifies that the film has nothing interesting to say, and will ultimately be remembered for a few bold scenes rather than its quality.In Fennell's other film, she pulls the same frustrating move. A movie that attempts interesting social commentary has its initial quality degraded by her need to surprise audiences, rather than write an effective ending. It makes me feel like she always begins writing screenplays before considering how they'll end.Saltburn is not a boring film, and it makes up for some of what it lacks with great performances, beautiful cinematography, and engaging scenes. I just can't help but feel disappointed that a film so interesting at the start becomes so shallow. 0.16666666666666666\n",
      "Well, I've got to say it. I think this is a great film.If I had to describe it I would probably say that is a well written, dark, twisted, critical film that really shows you how far people would go to get what they want. At it's core the film is about greed, madness and obsession, but I think that the deeper meaning of it all is the contrast of the real and the superficial, the disconnection that appears within the upper social classes.What I really liked in this movie is the fact that even though sometimes it feels uncomfortable to watch,it is really clever and sly. I enjoyed the transition that develops throughout the film, the way that things change and then they turn again, it becomes to you very clearly that the plot is not a throwaway story. The script and the actors do such a great job. 0.14875000000000002\n",

Better than the bright, over-coloured Netflix style of current times.Some weird moments that have been talked about a lot, but there was nothing surprising about where the story went. It was the most obvious 'Keyser Soze' of all time.Rosamind Pike did steal the show. I went in skeptical of the hype but she really did deliver.Barry Keoghan gave a great performance, although that Scouse accent slipped.Jacob Elordi was a big surprise. As a Brit myself, I was impressed at how he managed to pull off that young aristocrat, Eton educated rich boy.Richard R Grant and Alison Oliver also gave great performances.I'm surprised more people aren't mentioning Archie Madekwe though. He was the disappointment for me. Very bad American accent and unnatural performance.I have question marks over Oliver's family home. I'm not sure if it was meant to be working class to contrast the rich Saltburn house?....But if that's the case it did not work as Oliver's family home was not working class in the slightest....

      "First, the good. All the actors were great, especially Rosamund Pike. Brilliant as always. The direction was good and the sets and scenery were outstanding. It clearly had some money behind it, and of course had that ambivalent Oxford charm going for it at the start.I didn't know much about it before I watched and thought it was going to be a boring, coming-of-age movie about a college student who was gay-before-graduation or something. Instead, it turned into an almost-current day Talented Mr. Ripley and I fail to see what the point was.I expect so much more from Emerald Fennell. Why on earth return to that tired trope of elite class homosexuality as a sign of hedonism? We are so beyond that, and so is she. Pike did have a line that indicated how they toyed with non-heteronormative sex, but otherwise it was just tired. Sure, there were a few moments where I laughed, but it didn't make fun of itself until the end, and too late. Ridiculously absurd to think the police wouldn't have caught on very quickly. That the movie is well over two hours just tells me Fennell didn't know how to wrap it up adequately. I can tell you, despite a vaguely interesting twist that's been done before, the plot is numbingly boring. 0.13141025641025644\n",

The most obvious being the maze located on Saltburn's property. Characters have their own motives, talk behind one another's backs and manipulate each other with sex and drugs. It's an evil world and these children all need help. You'll enjoy this film if you enjoy watching the corrupted, yuppie children of England fornicate and medicate themselves into vast dissaray. The plot contains twists and turns and its main character, Oliver, is an unsettling, malicious, devious and overall sick in the head. Not to mention a vampire.

      "It is a mistake to only compare this film with \"The Talented Mr Ripley\", when the obvious source is \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" starring Dennis Price and a tour-de-force from that acting genius, Alec Guinness. Murdering your way to the top of an aristocratic family in the way that Emerald Fennell has constructed it, is very twenty-first century because of the ending but it does not make snese. And that is the problem for me. The reviewing of previous events from a different perspective implies a cynicism and motive that does not fit the main character. So when it is presented, astute members of the audience are not going to view it as a twist but are more likely to think \"Hang on a minute, what about when....???\" So whose fault is that? Scriptwriter and director are the immediate culprits and here they are the one and only Emerald Fennell. Her Oscar for the \"Promising Young Woman\" may have been justified. I don't think she's going to get anything for this one unless the \"Razzies\" are stuck for choice.Just a note about Barry Keoghan and his performance . I wish I was a fly on the wall when his agent convinced him to a) be stark-naked and pretend to \"screw\" through the freshly-dug grave of a main character to highlight his obssession with said character and b) pretend to lick the porcelain floor of the bath where that obssession has just masturbated, (\"Saw\" franchise please take note, if you want to push the boundaries of revulsion, check if Fennell is doing anything).

Satirical storytelling at one of its most nuanced, this movie soon became a lesson in multi-layered and deviantly intelligent filmmaking.Remarkable performances by Barry Keoghan (as Oliver Quick), Jacob Elordi (as Felix Catton), Rosamund Pike (as Elspeth Catton), Alison Oliver (as Venetia Catton), and Richard E. Grant (as Sir James Catton) carried this unforgettable plot across the finish line.Special shout-out to Archie Madekwe (as Farleigh Start), Ewan Mitchell (as Michael Gavey), and Carey Mulligan (as Pamela). They adeptly balanced the roster of quirky characters in \"Saltburn\".Oxford University came alive on screen, especially those parts where an 'outsider' like Oliver didn't quite fit in. A silent peer pressure prevailed, compelling him to accept his so-called fate of being 'ruled' by those who seemingly exerted an undeniable level of charm, like the much-beloved Felix Catton.The title sounded like it was referencing a drug, but in truth it was the name of the wealthy estate the Cattons called their castle. It was here Oliver lost his class-based 'virginity' and surrendered to the desire of becoming one of the one percent.There was more classism allegory than convenient bisexuality in this story. It took seemingly simple human perspectives and skewed them out of context until a darker human truth revealed itself. This was the genius behind Emerald Fennell's \"Saltburn\" movie.I loved how allegorical Oliver Quick's journey was as he gradually grew close to the man (Felix) whom he emulated, even wanted to become. He who came from nothing wanted to have everything.His invitation to stay at Saltburn with the Cattons gave \"Ollie\" all the room he needed to indulge that desire, even doing whatever it took to get it. The way he conned his way into the family's good graces was not far-fetched. There are thousands of Ollies out there accomplishing much the same.In this alluring story where nothing was as it seemed, eccentricities and debaucheries confluenced into empathy, the need to belong, and the dirty desire to climb the social ladder at whatever bloody cost.Suffice to say, \"Saltburn\" can be seen a few times and will probably manage to convey a different secret message with each viewing. 0.17950450450450448\n",

In the first half of the film the storyline may be slightly far fetched but the themes are plausible and very interesting. Plus there is humour and wit. As the film progresses with the climax of one of the main character's demise I was onboard. Then the film descends in a parody and I believe the cost was to be left out of any Oscar nominations. In short a step too far. The character played by Rosamund Pike (and I have met such types) would 100 % not fall in to the trickery of the main protagonist: money is their God not delusion.

      "It must be observed that \"Saltburn\" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning.

He simply aces his character that opts for no hold barred type of performance and shines in multiple scenes throughout. This was definitely an uneasy watch but it did pay off superbly in the end. Not going to lie but the story being set in England and that accent, helped too. The slow narrative actually contributed to building the intensity with the elaborated scenes to showcase Oliver's demeanour. Despite the predictability, the final confession still had the chills.

Really loved Alison Oliver in this as well, very believable - I have several friends from extremely rich families who would of been taken back by how much of a great mirroring that was, she really nailed it! There are some extraordinarily bizarre scenes in this film, very worth a watch if you like movies with a twist. 0.36260869565217396\n",
      "This is an absolute insult. Saltburn is one of those so called \"simpleton's epic\" movies. Just a noobish attempt to create an arthouse style drama with zero plausibility and undercooked structure.I'm really disgusted by the final twist. It's an absolute insult to the viewer! So Emerlad, you through a set of loosely established long shots, a bunch of disgusting disgusting behaviors (licking period blood, sniffing and drinking male fluids, ...), and tons of unfounded coincidences, then you \"shock\" us by the ridiculous reveal of \"it's by design from the beginning\" stock twist??

We did bets on who died and whats going to happen. It's good movie for sleepovers wheres no parents. My little sister was also watching it with us but at every \"weird\" scene we covered her eyes so she wont get dreams about that. But i liked that movies plot and story were good and the way that Oliver had everything planned was were impressive. I cried when Felix died but at the same time i laughed (i have dark humour). But i say that this movie is pretty good. 0.36326923076923084\n",
      "Went into it blind, and now this movie's vibes won't stop lingering in my mind. Totally a cult classic and can see why it's so polarizing. Could have been a bit better with less... fluids. It pushed the envelope at times and I wish I could erase some of the images from my mind. As someone who traveled around the UK for 4 months it was amazing to witness a beautiful palace inhabited by a complex range of characters on my screen. Although the intense secondhand embarrassment made me squirm at times, it added to the memorability of the film. Also loved seeing more of Jacob Elordi's range vs. What's displayed in Euphoria. 0.2041666666666667\n",

It is not for the faint of heart, as it contains some of the most gruesome, revolting, and nauseating scenes I have ever witnessed. Yet, I was captivated by its twisted plot, its brilliant cinematography, and its daring exploration of the dark side of human nature. I will never forget 2 scenes in particular: the one in the bathroom that made me gag, the one in the cemetery that left me speechless.This movie is a rare gem that will haunt me for a long time.

Enough scenes to get you somewhat disturbed.I liked the movie, but I didn't love it. I liked the shocking scenes, but at the end of the movie and given Oliver's motivations they feel a bit out of place and more for shock-value than true psych character. I liked the story and the twists, but I felt the whole obsession-theme is not particularly original. The characters were fun to get to know and to think about for a bit, but in the end it feels like the story doesn't do them justice and any complexity ia reduced. 0.3734243697478991\n",

Richard e. Grant as well was great. A real mixture of giggles, shocks twists and turns which I never saw coming. A few gasps and hands over the eyes moments . I don't want to give any spoilers as I think it ruins the experience of the film . Set in a beautiful mansion house with fantastic scenery and filming . I would watch this again just to see if I pick anything up I missed the first time . Top class film , acting and plot. 0.25686868686868686\n",
      "After watching several reels on Instagram about Saltburn, and of course, because of Jacob Elordi, I finally decided to watch the movie. I enjoyed the way the actors portrayed their characters, but throughout the movie, Felix's character made me believe that he was going to come out of the closet. Unfortunately, he didn't, and this might disappoint some of his fans.I must say that Barry Keoghan did justice to the character by playing Oliver, the quiet scholar who turns out to be a manipulative mastermind. However, I still couldn't understand why he did all of this. Was it because he was lonely? Or was it because he was never accepted by his peers? Or was it because Felix didn't return his love and affection?The actors did an excellent job, but to me, the movie lacked a sense of connection. So many things were happening, but there was no apparent reason behind why it was happening, and at some points, even logic seemed to have left the chat. For instance, the police didn't do an investigation after so many deaths, and it seemed like they only came to collect the bodies.Furthermore, the movie contained R-rated scenes that were beyond that rating, especially the vampire kiss. I think they should put a warning sign about it.Overall, it is a good one-time watch, and Barry Keoghan nailed it. 0.1671875\n",
      "Consider myself someone with good taste. Watched this and was disgusted for wasting 2.5 hours of precious time. It is very forgettable and at times annoying. Nothing to write about this movie. The streaming industry is providing a platform for movies like this which do not have one good thing. Reviews from imdb and rotten tomatoes can be very misleading. There is no hint of tension, comedy or style. All I see is pure indulgence of the director. I hope to see reviews which shed light on these kind of meaningless movies. In this era where you don't spend top dollars or put an effort to get to a cinema, honest reviews are the only savior of ones precious time. 0.13095238095238096\n",
      "This is such a hard movie to describe. I went in blind after hearing it was nominated for several awards and seeing it on my Amazon Prime recommendations.I was shocked, disgusted, confused, and yet riveted. Oliver seems like a regular socially awkward college kid that just wants to be liked.Then he just seems to like his new friend Felix a little too much so I thought maybe it was an unrequited love kinda story about a closeted gay kid and his best friend. But when Oliver's dad \"dies\" and Felix invited him to spend the summer with him, I thought maybe it would be a coming of age thing.Nope. Every time I thought I knew what was coming, I was wrong. I wouldn't call it a thriller but it's definitely a tale with a lot of winding story lines that don't make any sense until the end. Let me just say I was shocked, which is saying a lot.It wasn't particularly interesting or funny. The dialogue was mediocre and the characters seemed to all lack substance, but man I couldn't look away. It was just that weird. Definitely worth a watch if you like quirky dramas and don't mind a completely unnecessary amount of full frontal male nudity. I probably wouldn't watch it again but it was interesting. -0.06641849529780564\n",
      "The first problem that strikes you with this movie is that the so-called students portrayed are all well over 30 years old in real life. And they all look it. In reality they should be in their late teens/early 20s, not in or approaching their mid-30s.There was no plot to speak of, just a rambling series of incidents that had little to no point. Nothing ever really developed into anything worthwhile, and I think we can see the director/writer/producer (all one and the same) wanted to self-indulge at the audiences expense. I could think of many better ways to spend my time and money.Nothing that happens seems remotely credible, realistic, or even interesting unless you are a voyeur. 0.1949404761904762\n",
      "Absolutely fantastic acting by Barry as Oliver. Not everyone can play a narcissistic psycho, however Barry did an excellent job. I hope he gets an Oscar for this. So many are mentioning The Talented Mr. Ripley when this movie is nothing to do with stealing a person identity but it's actually something completely different. Different mental problem. Highly recommend as it flows naturally with amazing acting from all the cast and especially from Barry Keoghan. I know that a star is born and looking forward to watch more of Barry in a future. Barry is an unique actor who is not afraid to act actually. 0.23868421052631575\n",
      "I decided to watch this movie after seeing how people were \"freaking out\" on Tik Tok, and I was fully expecting it to be terrifying, but that's not the impression I got. Instead, I got a sense of obsession and desire that had turned into pure destruction.*Huge spoilers start here*The main character Oliver wasn't happy with his life, he wanted something more, he wanted popularity and privilege, and the only way he can get that was if he used manipulation and lies.He used these lies to fix himself into the other character, Felix's life.This is where it all turns destructive, he ends up wanting everything Felix has, his family's love, his power, his home, his life. So, obviously he took those. He loved this power, he loved this privilege, that he wanted it all to himself. That's when he becomes engulfed with desire and offs the whole family, one by one.This movie had a few things that made you feel uncomfortable, but overall this movie was beautiful. It makes you feel an attachment to Oliver, we are viewing this movie through his eyes, we are seeing how he thinks, making the whole situation seem \"less terrible\" in a way. This movie had beautiful scenery and the end was amazing, the power of his dance really just completed the whole vibe of the movie.Overall this movie did a good job with the, \"Eat The Rich\" symbolism. It was really good. 0.18015873015873018\n",
      "Saltburn is a gothic thriller that embodies the admirable feat of director Fennell.It is a story seemingly reminiscent of classic American college-set films, such as \"Revenge of the Nerds\" or \"Maial College.\" In the glitzy, gothic dimension of Oxford, however, Oliver does not want to be the usual nerdy freshman holed up in his nerd corner. Oliver knows from the beginning what he wants, as we viewers get swept up in this story that seems to be heading in a different direction for this \"rebellious genius.\" The nerd who becomes friends with the coolest guy in college, the nerd who is helped by the coolest, richest, and best-looking guy in college until he is invited to Saltburn's lavish and wealthy mansion. From this moment Oliver is no longer \"Oliver.\" What upsets us about the reversal of the situation is especially the ending. But let's think about it, how many times, even unconsciously, have we longed for the unattainable riches of unattainable people and, in the knowledge that we cannot obtain these riches, how many times have we hoped for the ruin of the great rich, even those contemporary to us, who are often very ignorant, lazy, undeserving. Saltburn is the concretization of the innermost thoughts of each of us, when we are faced with the rich who, like the Cottons, are so softened by luxury and unaccustomed to toil that it makes one angry to see them.And here Oliver shows that to really achieve anything in life, you have to work hard, be crafty, sometimes you even have to forget your dignity and put on the shoes of a completely different person. You have to persevere and infiltrate things, a bit like the moth that keeps banging on the windows until it enters the house (same metaphor used by Venicia, Félix's sister). Oliver succeeds; he has his technique for seizing his prey, demolishing them from the inside piece by piece until they are annihilated.Saltburn is a masterpiece, an English version of Parasite, with a few details, literally taken to extremes, from \"Call Me By Your Name,\" though only real life is read between the lines.Barry Keughan flawless, psychopathic, but credible, strong, charmingly creepy. 0.16015625000000003\n",
      "However, only really a film to watch with others. Plus, I would keep the snacks to a minimum.Filled with beautiful cinematics and locations throughout the city of Oxford.

So many references to Mythology had us questioning how far the rabbit hole goes. 0.29621212121212126\n",
      "With its abruptly orgiastic nature yet clear-cut structure, Fennel prioritises a lustful atmosphere for the film, while also engaging an ,often untouched, curiosity within viewers.

Men are so lovely and dry.\" -Elspeth Catton.Saltburn is a cocktail of misinterpreted love, tragic entitlement, euphoric luxury and poetic obsession, that blends tastefully with the story's contemporary gothic theme.

      "Yes it mimics BR but without any of the class and character. The actors are by and large just props trying their best in a film that is too deep and unnecessarily pretentious. An art house film that fails in every area with too much swearing, smoking and homo erotic nudity. Why bother I ask myself. A real let down but in the hands of another director it could have been good with more focus and less dark side which gave nothing to people like me. Think of all the money on the budget though. A complete waste of 2 hours, shame.None of the characters seem to claim the attention, somewhat distracted and aware they are acting which is a fail in my eyes.

Although I'm a fan of Emerald Fennel's work, like Promising Young Woman, so that also intrigued me for this movie. As for the actors, I've also seen Euphoria, so I'm not a fan of Jacob Elordi. I know he only played a character, but I hate his character in that show. And I wasn't really familiar with Barry Keoghan before this movie. But after that last scene, I'm a fan. No, only half kidding; I'm a new fan of his work but not because of that scene. Emerald just masters making a satisfying ending to a movie.

      "It's important to know that this movie is not for the faint hearted. It's crude, shocking, artsy, and it seems to take pleasure in shocking us to the core...multiple times! I was watching one scene through the fingers that were covering my eyes. Then when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, the wildest thing happened. Definitely not a predictable film. It's enjoyable with a lot of x-rated shock factor but if you can enjoy a movie that pushes you outside of your comfort zone then it's worth a try as Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elodi do a terrific job with their performances.

      "Going by the trailer, I didn't think I would enjoy Saltburn at all, but I liked the fact that it mocked the super rich and privileged whilst also taking swipes at those who are so enamoured by the elite that they would even go so far as to slurp their spunky bathwater. And hump their graves.Barry Keoghan plays Oliver Quick, who is at Oxford on a scholarship, and who is desperate to fit in with the establishment; to this end, he befriends charming aristocrat Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi, channeling Rupert Everett) who eventually invites him to spend the summer at Saltburn, the Catton family estate. While there, Oliver locks horns with Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe), gets fruity with Venetia Catton (Alison Oliver), wins over Elspeth Catton (Rosamund Pike) and becomes more and more infatuated with Felix, but always feels like an outsider looking in. However, Ollie has a plan...A well acted, smartly directed film that gradually becomes more and more perverse, with some truly stomach churning scenes involving bodily fluids, Saltburn is, for the most part, a deviant delight. What lets the film down a bit is the fact that writer/director Emerald Fennell feels the need to spoon-feed the audience with an ending that was clearly intended to be a clever 'reveal', but which most people would have already figured out for themselves. It's like one of those endings from a Saw movie, where the character's actions are explained through a series of flashbacks, but it treats the viewer like a bit of an idiot.7/10 - An enjoyably warped attack on the upper class and those who aspire to be like them, but the ending could have been handled better. 0.25257936507936507\n",

The truly outstanding actor here is Barry Keoghan who does an outstanding job of bringing Oliver alive with such a striking performance. The rest of the characters are stereotypes and under developed. Carey Mulligan is totally wasted here in a part that is just stupid and does nothing more than let you in on how utterly ridiculous and superficial the Catton family is.

Ive not long discovered him but recently he's been fantastic in the things I have. (Dunkirk, The Banshees of Insherin, Masters of the air)The north/sourh divide in this film is very prevalent. And me being from the north I could feel Oliver's emotions and the pressure he was under - that's not to say I would drink bath water or get naked over a gravestone!It messes with your head this film. You don't know who's right and who's wrong at times and the power play between the characters and the endless struggle to be in power is exhaustingly good.I was on Oliver's side all the way through and when Felix disowns him I was made up they all got their hair deserts (Felix, Venetia and Farleigh)However,I didn't see the end coming. What a great twist and it turns out Oliver had planned and was behind it all along.Best film I've seen this year, and of course we finished with a bit of Sophie Ellis Bextor (and more nudity - why should we be surprised!) 0.11941964285714285\n",

Even if we assume the sexuality and the explicit scenes was to distract the other characters in the story, why would you show the antagonist perform a sexually explicit scenes in solitude. Is the purpose for the antagonist to mislead other characters or is it a way for the writer/director/producer to confuse the audience?

Which is the second half the movie. The sharp turn around half way through is where the film gets way more interesting, and really showcases what a star lead actor Barry Keoghan Will most likely become.There was enough dark comedy throughout the whole thing for it to be a decent watch too.

It's for sure not a comedy, or maybe I didn't get the humour. I wouldn't call it a thriller either, maybe for the last five minutes, but it was quite predictable what happened. A drama it is for sure, but that's the genre that is least appealing to me. A good drama though, and that's all due to the excellent acting of the cast. Barry Keoghan and Rosemund Pike got nominated for the Golden Globes, which I get as they were on top. Jacob Elordi was also very good in my opinion.

Oliver's obsession then builds and he does things that are pretty vile and also mostly added to the film for shock value.Eventually Felix finds out about Oliver's lies, and when he no longer wants anything to do with him Oliver then decides to kill Felix and then rest of his family, but does it in a way in which the family doesn't suspect him or any foul play. Felix's mother is the last alive and wills the mansion over to Oliver when she is basically on her death bed. Then Felix lives in the mansion alone.That is the basic summary of the film, and some parts actually made us nauseous like the bathroom scene where Oliver licks the bottom of the tub including the drain after Felix had bathed in it and jerked off... yea that happens. 0.13219696969696973\n",

Don't get me wrong, I love Talented Ripley, but if you want to do something similar, make it better. This movie still obviously very entertaining and has its shock value throughout, but also not exactly believable which I think is a big part of a good thriller.Anyway, it's still worth watching, very entertaining.

Seldom has a movie had no likeable characters in it but then there's very little character development shown.

      "The first two acts of the movie feel somewhat dull, with a weirdly fast pacing that does not build too much on Oliver and Felix's friendship, they just quickly become best friends. It is rushing to get to the Saltburn part, where it feels like the movie starts again. After some truly disgusting and hard-to-watch moments, the third act picks up and, even though it does not make up for the less interesting first part, the twists are good and grab your attention until the very end. The best part of the film is definitely the acting. Every character in Saltburn is played really well, but Barry Keoghan is extraordinary. Paired with Oliver's very well-written character, I started by pitying him, then being grossed out by him, and finally hating him. Overall, not great, I expected more.

      "Saltburn is a great and entertaining movie.It has all a masterpiece needs: great acting, and an intriguing storyline, a special atmosphere and an amazing scenery.A young and ordinary scholar from Oxford sneaks himself into an aristocrat family where he tries to please and adapt, hopelessly trying to become part of the group.Weird scenes unfold and the feeling alternates between awkward and funny. You don't really get what exactly is happening and always wonder what the story has still to offer. As other \"ordinarys\" surrounding the family get thrown out for shallow reasons and members of the family begin to die, a suspicion grows. But it's still not clear, as the main character seemes to be devastated about the death of felix. In the end everything falls apart.Ending here it would be a great movie. You could talk about what you think happened. And the discussion could begin, what it was about: I think it could best be seen as an allegory to modern day capitalism and it's mechanisms destroying everything from inside out.Also it could be a symbol for the difficulties of modern day humans to connect in a meaningful way and the somehow growing distance in a world where everything seems so close and everything can be achieved.Like that it would've been a masterpiece for me. Unfortunately they decided minutes from the end to include a flashback where everything gets explained and every ambiguities gets destroyed. A very cheap way to explain the twist, that beforehand was laid down so nice and quietly all throughout the film. Somehow the movie destroys all that for cheap reasons - ironically its fate is very similar to its characters.While i was honestly dissapointed by the ending, its still a good movie, just not the masterpiece it could've been. 0.2281794131794132\n",

The have's, and the have-not's. Rich boy befriends poor boy and invites him to his stately family castle. It doesn't end well. The extremely beautiful camerawork, and the sometimes abrupt plot twists which seem to have no real psychological explanation, give this film an air of a poem - a strange poem that does not give a realistic picture of the \"real\" world but follows its own inner logic. At the end, we think we understand what happened and why. But I think, we don't - not until we appreciate the new meaning that the director has given to the term \"working class\" (which may be one of the reasons that American viewers seem to rate this film so low). 0.10294612794612792\n",

When I had watched 53 minutes of it, it felt like it was twice as long as that. Plus, Barry Keoghan is very ugly and unappealing to me and doesn't have any unique talent as an actor that makes him stand out. He's a little overrated. However, the movie had good directing and artistic imagery that added a lot of fine quality to it.

      "Lush cinematography, a variegated musical score, a tight ensemble cast, and strong psychosexual themes makes this movie quite the cosmic ride! Emerald Fennell with new indie film, Saltburn, does a great job, here. The story centers and is narrated by Oliver Quick, played masterfully by Barry Keoghan, who attends Oxford on a scholarship in the mid-2000's and befriends, Felix Catton, a handsome, rich, elite played by Jacob Elordi, who invites Oliver to his palatial residence, Saltburn, to wile away the lazy days of summer and mingle with his eccentric family. This movie has some jarring scenes, to put it mildly, and may repel some and titillate others. Everyone who I was with in attendance tonight were totally drawn into the Catton's world and many clapped after the movie was over. Another movie that may continue with a cult following???

      "In the realm of modern filmmaking, \"Saltburn,\" directed by Emerald Fennell, stands as a testament to the power of visual storytelling, albeit with a narrative that struggles to keep pace. The movie stars Barry Keoghan, whose performance as Oliver is a complex blend of mystery and menace, set against the backdrop of the English aristocracy.Fennell, renowned for her work in \"A Promising Young Woman,\" returns with a film that is both aesthetically stunning and thematically ambitious. The use of a 1.33 aspect ratio not only complements but elevates the grandeur of the setting, evoking a sense of timelessness. The color grading and lighting are nothing short of spectacular, crafting scenes that are a feast for the eyes.However, \"Saltburn\" stumbles in its plot execution. The story is a whirlwind of ideas, at times feeling scattered and lacking coherence. The progression from Oliver's initial portrayal as an awkward, nerdy student to a cold-blooded murderer is jarring and leaves the audience grasping for understanding. This abrupt shift underscores a missed opportunity to explore the character's motives and intentions in depth.Interestingly, the emotional resonance of individual scenes is palpable, thanks to the commendable acting and direction. Each scene is a vignette of emotion, yet they struggle to weave together into a cohesive whole. The film's climax, revealing Oliver's deception about his father's death, should have been a pivotal moment, reshaping the narrative's tone. Instead, it adds to the growing sense of disarray.The soundtrack, particularly the use of \"Murder on the Dancefloor,\" encapsulates the essence of the film brilliantly. It's a clever juxtaposition of upbeat rhythms and dark themes, mirroring the film's own struggle between aesthetic beauty and narrative chaos.\"Saltburn\" is a film that paradoxically improves upon reflection, a quality both intriguing and frustrating. The realization of its deeper themes and metaphors comes too late, leaving the viewer disengaged for much of the journey. The lack of clarity in character motives further diminishes the impact of their actions. 0.07694444444444447\n",

The movie was excellent. Good writing and directing. It took me through a journey where I rooted for the protagonist and also desired more from the character when others doubted or looked down on him and then only to be blown away by the plot twist in the that tied it all up. Many unexpected turns and many freaky moments by Keoghan. I was attached, intrigued, hopeful, sympathetic, anxious, disgusted, shocked and ultimately amazed.

From there on the rest of it was pretty medium to be honest.I have to say that the plot was too predictable for my liking but it might have something to do with comparing it to The Talented Mr. Ripley and also Barry Keoghan playing the role of Martin in The Killing of a Sacred Deer.There were lot of beautiful scenes and Barry delivered an amazing performance as always. The final act still felt quite rushed and altogether left a lot of annoying questions in my mind.Maybe the motive for Oliver to do everything he did was just simply the fact that he could but I still wish that the \"twist\" at the end was more complex.7/10. 0.2161538461538462\n",

Especially the Lord and Lady of Saltburn. Hear, hear to them. Keough remains endlessly watchable for me, even if this feels like a separated-at-birth portrayal next to his work in Lanthimos' \"Killing of a Sacred Deer.\" So he may be up for a change of roles, perhaps something more light in a Edgar Wright.Don't want to spoil this, I do believe you should see it. Just perhaps gauge your anticipation. It is unique enough despite some resonances to other films. I am a little curious if there is some deeper than fairy tales and sideways shades of Dorian Greys , maybe back to myths where Pan goes hunting on in the halls of Olympus.In his first scene, Barry as Oliver mentions style over substance, and that's where the movie wound up for me. But perhaps a later viewing, or reading others reviews will deepen my experience. There's a pretty painting of power as aphrodisiac, sure.

      "This is a complex movie, with perhaps too many moving parts, although one gets to know the main characters well. And a lot of it is about the British class system. Felix and Oliver are at Oxford, but from quite different backgrounds. Oliver is quite smart and well read. After Oliver does Felix a very important favor, he is invited to spend the summer at the family estate with Felix. And this is no small house. And there are quite a few people staying there, family and hanger-ons. And some are written much better than others. There are some clever lines: \"Have to go to London. Funeral. Pamela. She would do anything for attention.\" Oliver has a birthday during the summer, and says he can't go have it with family. So they throw a massive birthday party for him. This gets one to about the 3rd Act, and this is perhaps the most disturbing part of the movie, and one will not look at Oliver the same again. And the role of Oliver is done very well.

      "I saw Saltburn, starring Barry Keoghan-The Green Knight, Dunkirk; Jacob Elordi-Priscilla, Deep Water; Rosamund Pike-Gone Girl, Die Another Day and Carey Mulligan-Promising Young Woman, Inside Llewyn Davis.This is an intriguing story about the differences between the rich and poor. Barry plays a smart young man-but just scraping by in the financial area-entering his first year at Oxford University. He meets and befriends Jacob, a fellow student who is also an aristocrat. Barry studies hard and gets good grades while Jacob likes to party and depend on his father's money to get by. When summer break comes along, Jacob invites Barry to come stay with him and his family at their estate in the countryside. Saltburn is the name of the estate. Rosamund plays Jacob's mother, who being a little eccentric-as is the whole family-welcomes Barry with open arms. Carey is another person that is staying at Saltburn, and yes, she is eccentric too. The film is a little slow in parts but gets more interesting when the aristocrats start partying. They even dress in tuxedos for dinner, which Barry has to borrow one, to fit in. There are some twists and turns you may not see coming. I can imagine that you will not soon forget the bath tub scene-or the graveyard one, either.It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.It would be a good one to stream. 0.13635912698412697\n",

And the. It sits there for 30 minutes or so. Not moving. Then we're brought to the elitist estate with the big windows and mirrors and grounds with a maze (don't get lost, is the marketing tagline).

Basically, set in 2006, scholarship student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) begins attending Oxford University. He struggles to fit in and lacks upper-class sensibilities and the same privileges that many students have from their wealthy parents. He does have conversations with Michael Gavey (Ewan Mitchell) who wants to be his friend, but then Oliver notices affluent and popular student Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). He eventually strikes up a friendship with Felix after helping him when his bicycle wheel has a puncture. Felix invites Oliver to join him and his group of friends for a drink in the pub, leaving Michael who dislikes Felix. Felix is empathetic to Oliver's stories, including his parents having substance abuse problems and mental health issues. Felix makes a consistent effort to include him despite disapproval from his other Oxford friends, including his American cousin Farleigh Start (Gran Turismo's Archie Madekwe). Their friendship grows over the course of the year, but Felix becomes annoyed with Oliver's constant presence, and they have a small spat. One night, Oliver learns that his father has died and shows up distraught at Felix's door. Felix comforts him, and knowing that he has nowhere to go, invites him to spend the summer at his family's large estate, Saltburn. At Saltburn, Oliver is introduced to Felix's parents, Sir James (Richard E. Grant) and Lady Elspeth (Rosamund Pike), and his sister Venetia (Alison Oliver). Also staying at Saltburn are Farleigh and family friend Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan). Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family, who are sympathetic to his situation and amused by his lack of social graces. Elspeth is fascinated by him as they bond together, and he grows increasingly comfortable at Saltburn. For a few nights, Oliver sees Venetia in a drunken state wandering the grounds. One night, he meets with her in the house garden, and after some conversation performs oral sex on her. Farleigh witnessed this and goads Oliver about telling Felix about it. When confronted by Felix, Oliver lies that it was Venetia who initiated the act, and he immediately cuts her out from the family. Meanwhile, Oliver's obsession with Felix grows stronger. One night, he watches Felix masturbate in the bath, and he drinks the bath water and licks the plug after Felix leaves. Tensions between Oliver and Farleigh reach breaking point when during a karaoke party they have a flirtatious moment, and Farleigh tricks Oliver into performing \"Rent\" by Pet Shop Boys in front of the family. Later that night, Oliver goes into Farleigh's room, gives him a handjob while also threatening him. The next morning, Farleigh is forced to leave Saltburn after it is said that he was trying to steal valuables from the house. Later, while Oliver is with Felix and Elspeth, she casually mentions that Pamela has died, apparently committing suicide. As the summer draws to a close, Elspeth and James plan an elaborate party to celebrate Oliver's birthday. The morning of the party, Felix surprises Oliver after organising to visit his estranged mother Paula (Dorothy Atkinson), answering a call from her on his phone. Oliver resists, but Felix insists that he try to repair their relationship. However, arriving at his mother's house, Oliver's background stories have been fabricated: his father Jeff (Shaun Dooley) is alive, and his parents live in a respectable upper-middle-class suburb. Felix is angered by Oliver's deception and wants him to leave Saltburn after the party. During the extravagant celebrations, Oliver encounters Farleigh, who reminds him that he will always be an outsider to their lifestyle. Hundreds of guests are there to sing \"Happy Birthday to You\" but it is apparent many can't remember Oliver's name. Desperate to reconcile with Felix, Oliver follows him into Saltburn's large hedge maze. He interrupts Felix having sex with a female guest who runs away, he feels hurt and confusion over Oliver's actions. Oliver tries to reason and perhaps flirt with him, but ultimately Felix rejects him and says he needs professional help. The next morning, Felix is found dead in the middle of the maze. During a tense family lunch, Oliver mentions that the night before Farleigh was taking and handing out drugs, implying a possible connection to Felix's death. James banishes Farleigh from Saltburn and cuts off all his financial support. After Felix's funeral, the Cattons question Oliver's presence, despite this, Elspeth insists that he may stay at Saltburn. Oliver mourns Felix desperately, returning to his grave, taking off his trousers and underwear, and penetrating the soil. One night, Venetia is in the bath distraught and inebriated. She accuses Oliver of disintegrating her family. He tries to seduce her again, but she is disturbed by his behaviour and rebuffs him. The following morning, Venetia is found dead in the bath, apparently suicide after slitting her wrists. James, despondent and suspicious of Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn, asks him to leave. Oliver repeatedly insists that he cannot leave Elspeth in her hysterical state. But James realises Oliver is manipulative and furiously bribes him to disappear and never contact them again. Years later, Oliver is in a café reading a newspaper with an article that James has died. There, he has a chance encounter with Elspeth who is delighted to see him. She insists that he return with her to Saltburn, having not been there in some time herself. They spend several months together, but Elspeth suddenly falls fatally ill. Elspeth is in hospital on life support, and Oliver is there recounting all his actions. He reveals he had been responsible for all the tragedies that took place at Saltburn. Oliver deliberately punctured Felix's bike tyre in order to meet him, he poisoned Felix in the hedge maze after final rejection, he subtly manipulated Venetia into cutting and killing herself, and he fabricated the email that led to Farleigh leaving the estate. Finally, it is revealed that he planned his reacquaintance with Elspeth and that she subsequently left all the financial assets to him, including ownership of Saltburn. After all his confessions, Oliver forcefully removes the tube supplying oxygen for Elspeth, killing her. Now officially the owner of Saltburn and the Catton fortune, Oliver dances naked around the mansion to \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the death stones with all family names are displayed on a sideboard. Also starring Paul Rhys as Duncan the butler, Reece Shearsmith as Professor Ware, Lolly Adefope as Lady Daphne, Sadie Soverall as Annabel, and Millie Kent as India. Keoghan is compelling as the awkward young man who lingers in the mansion, Elordi plays the charming obnoxious rich boy well, Pike steals all her scenes with her great one-liners, Grant is reliable as always, Madekwe is good at being hateful, and Mulligan's cameo is welcome. What starts as a crush and wanting to fit in with the rich people goes in a dark direction you don't expect, it follows a familiar format where the wealthy eccentric characters are all unlikeable, it is funny when it needs to be, amusingly cringey and uncomfortable in moments, and the twists work relatively well, and the final scene and song choice is genius, it is certainly a memorable and worthwhile black comedy psychological thriller.

      "I always find it interesting when I see reviews that are clearly bimodal - a lot of ones and a lot of tens. It actually piques my interest in the film because it suggests to me that there's something offending people. That is definitely the case here. Yes, there are some graphic and shocking scenes. But it's not like this is a movie about ordinary people... I actually appreciated that the psychotic people acted like they were psychotic: sometimes predictably normal and other times quite abnormal. And seriously-the \"graphic\" scenes were not horrific - they just made watchers really uncomfortable -which I think was the point -and made the movie more interesting. I thought the acting was very good (especially Pike and Keoghan- who has an amazing range. How can one person be so unattractive and so attractive in the same film? Brilliant) and the story had the right amount of predictability and surprise. And yes, this general plot isn't new. But the characters are so interesting- realistic at times and completely unreal at others-that I thought it worth a watch. 0.1394756318949867\n",
      "Wow. I have watched the film four times and each time I love it more! I loved Emerald's 'Promising Young Woman' a couple years back so I have been excited since this film was announced. This film will take you places you didn't know you could go. An absolute thrill ride with an ending you don't want to miss. The camera work was stunning. Barry Keoghan and Rosamund Pike were both standouts and I'm so happy to see their golden globe nominations! The rest of the cast was also stellar. I loved Carey Mulligan's cameo scenes. She is absolutely incredible. This film is a wild, crazy, bonkers ride and I am here for it! I hope this film performs well that the Oscars. Easily in my top 3 favorite films of this year, possibly even number 1. (And I watch a lot of movies- 103 in theatres alone in 2023 as of 12/16/23).

      "Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is a scholar student at Oxford. He is not from money and is looked down upon by his classmates, especially his clothes. He manages to make friends with Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) a very wealthy and popular student. When Oliver's father dies, Felix invites him home for the summer to his manor known as Saltburn. Oliver makes initial errors concerning the wealthy but quickly transforms from a naive boy to a scheming alpha predator.My initial reaction was this was a modern dark British version of \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\" the one where Nick Nolte had sex with everyone. The protagonist was not very likeable and neither was anyone else. Entertaining but overrated.Guide: F-word. Sex? Butt nudity. 0.14097222222222222\n",

      "I expected more from this movie. It starts out in Oxford where you see a less than privileged student want to be friends with a popular rich student. From what I saw and heard online, it was supposed to be disturbing, it was definitely weird and gross in a few scenes. However, there were so many issues with the film in my opinion that had to fall into place for it to really happen. Many scenes had me laughing due to character dialogue or just the scene lay out itself. This was cinematically a beautiful film. The house where most of the film is set, is stunningly gorgeous. The storyline seems predictable and you can catch where it's going mid way through if you pay attention to the film . For rich people, they are a bit naive and in reality they would never do such a thing as they did in this film. It fell a little flat for me and it was nothing great, I think I expected more as people hyped it up soo much. Severe nudity in the last 5 minutes so be prepared. He is a distubed character with super rich naive characters, that's pretty much the main take away. 0.15355392156862746\n",

The acting was ok, the characters weren't realistic at all. It got pretty nasty, not sure why it wasn't rated NC-17. My biggest issue with this movie is why it was so slow and boring. For some reason, they decided to wait until the very end, to put in all the pertinent scenes. Nobody wants to see a movie where everything important that happens during the story is left out, for the last 5min. This was really bad. Like I said, the acting was ok, but it was not a good movie. -0.13968253968253969\n",
      "Saltburn give me a feeling of already seen, already explored. Nothing to say that it is well directed and has first-rate actors well dropped in their characters, but I believe that much of my postive rating depends on Barry Keoghan's presence. Oliver, his characters in Saltburn, is a sort of centre of gravity for the story. All turn around him, he is a sort of Black Hole, a powerfull element of attraction and destruction. With his engaging and passionate acting, Keoghan brings his character to life, captivating the audience with his raw talent and emotional depth. His ability to show a wide range of emotions, from vulnerability to harshness, adds a layer of authenticity to the film. His on-screen presence is magnetic, drawing viewers in and keeping them invested in his character's journey. His chemistry with the rest of the cast is palpable, creating compelling dynamics and enhancing the overall storytelling. I think that whitout Barry Keoghan as Oliver, Saltburn would have been a good film, but not too good to be noticed. With him, it deserves to be seen and recommended. 0.1608974358974359\n",
      "To watch Saltburn is to be audience to a great filmmaker. As the intro transitioned into the opening credit sequence, I was emotionally overwhelmed at the profound style of filmography that is so lacking in most movie releases nowadays and yet that I was able to experience at my local chain theater. There are regularly fantastic shots through the course of the film, and some of the editing is super impactful. Of course the mis-en-scene is grand, and though the period is too ill-defined to yet feel like a period piece--this is coming from one who lived some formative years then, as a high schooler c. 2006--the soundtrack (and certain clothes, i.e. Trashy colors and swim-prep summerwear) provides just enough of a setting.I also got choked up when the main character delivers the line that he's not like the mooted object of affection, that his life actually depends on succeeding in school (rather than being born with a silver spoon). And yet while the film does deliver several more cutting lines in that millenial theme of inequality (delivered via the British sociocultural touchstones of class), it ultimately banalizes that profound critique by transforming into a neo-Gothic monster movie, in which the traditionally-unsuspecting outsider who finds himself in an old mansion with a creepy family does not fall victim to the aristocratic monsters, nor does he slay them as such, but rather the genre is inverted, as he himself turns out to be the monster. (Also, this inversion brings us back to uncomfortable classic Hollywood territory regarding non-heteronormative sexuality, as the psychosexual perversions engaged in by that main character become not erotic metaphors for the desire of wealth by the proletariat as in their initial reading but are rendered in the end as behaviors to be condemned as associated with psychopathic killers. This problematic neo-Hitchcockian twist stood out all the moreso during my viewing experience among, for lack of a better term, a half-full theater of \"normies\", i.e. A typical stratum of suburban Estadounidenses, who generally laughed in unease, or expressed disgust sex--or even just nude--scenes.)Emerald Fennell is capable of masterful cinema, so it's too bad that the screenplay lets this picture down, into something that provides scenes to certainly savor but overall is jumbled into a messy narrative not worth remembering.(P. S. Kudos to IMDB for being the first place I saw anything about this film, when I was able to first watch the trailer. I've been awaiting it ever since as one of the few major releases I wanted to catch in theater, and I am glad I was able to, for those aforementioned moments.) 0.11507698412698412\n",

It's a hell of a movie that I enjoyed thoroughly.This movie is not \"unintentionally hilarious.\" It is intentionally hilarious and I believe if you enter into it knowing that you will enjoy it as much as I did.

But luckily it had a amazingly written twisted ending that you simple could not stop watching.

I came into it thinking it was a horror or scary movie surrounded with a load of hype only to find Temu was called upon to write the script of this movie.

      "Excellent acting from all. Whoever says the sex is extreme in the parental ratings is having a laugh. The sex is all implied but not seen. Lots of darkness and shadows in the sex scenes conceals the vulgarity but reveals the emotions which is how it should be. There's a bit of nudity and a rather dark moment in a cemetery but it's akin to the pie scene in American Pie (awkward) However, all that implied, you CAN see a twisted version of stiff upper lip/classist/begging to belong/ in almost every aspect of the film. Go in with an open mind and if you're a fan of The Talented Mr. Ripley you'll be a fan of this. The bougie life style of the upper crust is portrayed like those in New York being barred from Club 54 standing on the wrong side of the velvet rope and the posers trying to get in.

This familiarity in narrative is the film's primary weakness.Notably, the film's resonance amplifies over time. It's a piece that invites deeper contemplation and rewards revisiting.

The paradoxal happiness within chaos, the sorority inside the selfishness, all the ambiguity of the carachters was well portrayed. Some of the scenes that people considered too vulgar or too compelling are artistic and full of life. The story may not be the brightest or the most innovative, but it certainly is well told. The choreography of the dances and the well paced music helped making it a joyful piece to watch. Definitely worth the time, a good surprise for the beginning of the year.

The lighting, art direction, make up, wardrobe, locations etc are all great. The music is good (I will never be able to listen to Murder on the Dance Floor again without thinking of BK's dancing). I saw the film at a cinema and the film format gave the audience an intimate, voyeuristic view of the action. Every person on screen brings a good performance - Paul Rhys's butler, Alison Oliver's Venetia, Archie Madekwe's Farleigh, Barry Keoghan's Oliver, Jacob Elordi's Felix, Rosalind Pike's. Elspeth etc are all perfect....

Sure, some specific incidents are new to this version, but the overall theme, mood, and delivery matches practically scene for scene. Theree is a lot to really like in Saltburn, and I hope no one's review here will deter anyone from seeing the mesmerizing performance of Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin).

Rosamund Pike never fails to captivate us with her performance, and we see Jacob Elordi perfectly embody a young adult in the 2000s. The cinematography and direction are on point and the scenes that could be disturbing are perfectly crafted to make us uncomfortable, but not to the point where we need to stop the movie.

To be honest Ollie played it all off well and to use his emotional intelligence to be cunning in the film was clever but still messed up in many ways.

      "The latest iteration of Mr. Ripley, this time successful in his scheme to steal the identities and social power of others.Though acted with passion by all the actors, the film falls short of any real complexity and depth; the characters serve only as one-dimensional chess pieces; the several relationships are at best forced and stereotyped, and so is the description of that aristocratic world; some scenes, with all their metaphoric intent, verge on the ridiculous and kitsch for the purpose of pure entertaining: the protagonist licking the bathtub where his obsession (Felix) had just ejaculated; the creepy sexual conquests by the main character with members, completely unjustified if not because we have to assume he is irresistible; so irresistible is the charm that the whole aristocratic family is tricked by, as if they are some sort of naive, vulnerable bunch of idiots; then -be ready- the tired symbolism of a labyrinth (really!) with a cartoonish statue of a demon in the center, worthy of a B- horror movie.

Come for the acting, stay for gorgeous visuals and feeling of nostalgia. This story doesn't feel new, but like tales we have all heard and seen, chopped up and rearranged in a new light. It's reminiscent of many other films and stories. Things unravel for Olli and they don't stop and when you think you know and it's all going to end, it doesn't. Saltburn is surprising yet familiar. You can't help but fall for the characters. It's a tale of obsession, of wanting what you cannot have and living as though you've got nothing to lose. Saltburn is having your cake and eating it too.

      "Maybe it's a mismatch between consumer and creator, and a lack of understanding on my end, but I don't think Fennell's style is for me. I was left bewildered with all the praise and acclaim PYW accrued and her sophomore effort leaves much to be desired even with its many, overly gratuitous moments that seemed to do little more than just offer shock value and attempt to gross out its viewers. Saltburn had more than its fair share of interesting set ups and character introductions to keep me entertained but as time waned it became evermore apparent this was all it had to offer.The scenes pass by and the oddness of the whole situation evolves which causes the tension to build and for me to ask, \"where is all this heading?\" (with Felix dead, obviously...but why and how?), but then I stopped caring and simply wanted it to end. Unfortunately, sticking it through to the end left me unsatisfied. Too many gross scenes that tested my resolve to not look away and too many set ups that ultimately went nowhere.Noticeably, there are 3 characters with apparently no consequence to the plot. The college friend, the mom's crazy friend (Pamela), and the butler are all set up that led me to believe they would be relevant to the story, but do little more than offer a few lines of dialogue and weirdness to the atmosphere; the first two are unceremoniously removed from the story before long and seem to have not benefited the plot, at all. The college friend makes a thunderous entrance when he states he is a math genius yells in the cafeteria; Pamela's presence made me wonder what the family is actually up to (maybe they enjoy psychologically torturing people); and the butler, butlers throughout the movie but doesn't seem to actually do anything of consequence. His character was especially deemed useless in the closing moments of the film when Oliver is able to reintegrate himself with Elspeth, poison her or whatever he did to her, and the butler is nowhere to be seen.Another major issue I take with the film is the plot twist that Oliver's parents are, in fact, not drug addicts and his dad didn't die. Up to this point, it's set up that Oliver is a willing pawn in some game of Felix's and he is an awkward guy who is obsessed with Felix, while also playing some game of his own. That's all and well except much like the aforementioned characters, this set up goes nowhere. The family with all of its weird eccentricities and overtones of class struggle and manipulation seem to be forgotten once we are more keenly aware Oliver is scheming in a more nefarious manner than previously thought.By the end of the film I simply didn't care what was happening. It took too long to get anywhere and substituted plot development with overly drawn out gross out scenes and setups that didn't ever seem to go anywhere. Like, why did Oliver try to manipulate Venetia regarding her eating disorder? This moment is set up and in a previous scene, Oliver acts upon the information, Venetia eats a croissant in front of him, and then....nothing.I recommend maybe passing on this one and DO NOT watch with your parents or anyone you would get embarrassed easily with while watching a man lick a woman's menstrual blood or copulate with a grave. 0.06041666666666667\n",

      "This film is really beautiful to look at. It's almost two different films, one about obsession and one about psychopathy. The first film is interesting, subtle and has a relatable depth. The second is about psychopathy. Guess which film was more nuanced and thoughtful? Guess which film was silly and a stupid betrayal of the former film? The contrast is weird and jarring. But, even though this is the case, I still wasn't bored, I had to watch it to the silly end. And it got sillier and sillier until the last scene culminates in a naked man dancing around a mansion shaking his bits and bum, reveling in the the fact that he killed a rich family and now owns their property. Don't get me wrong though, Barry Keoghan has a great body so I was still entertained. I was just dissapointed with what could have been. This could have been a brilliant film. 0.03531746031746034\n",
      "Set in the nostalgic mid-2000's, Saltburn follows a quiet but sinister student called Oliver (played by Barry Keoghan, at his most creepy) who ingratiates himself into his posh friend's aristocratic family, with questionable motives.Over the course of the film, Oliver morphs into a vampiric sociopath, growing on this family like a tumour, as the film tries to ham-fistedly explore themes of jealousy, lust and social inequity.The tumour analogy is also apt, because watching this film was about as comfortable as a colorectal exam. What follows for two excruciating hours is a long-winded attempt at a dark-humoured drama, where we meet gaggle of unlikeable, two-dimensional toffs who are slowly exploited by creepy little Oliver. To maintain the audience's attention, these encounters are then interspersed with (what else?) gratuitous, feral sex scenes, purely for shock value.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, herself a wealthy heiress who undoubtedly made it in Hollywood thanks to her social privilege, her attempts to explore these themes of class and envy fall completely flat, especially if you contextualise the them through her gaze. The irony here is really astounding.Like Fennell's first film, Promising Young Woman, which won a sympathy Oscar due to its topical (but superficial) exposé of an important narrative, this too was an unimaginative attempt of a worthwhile subject where nothing worthwhile was actually said. Fennell again is out of her depth, despite her results being only puddle-deep. The end result seemed more like a series of quirky vignettes featuring disdainful a******es, stitched together to form a slow and pretentious melodrama.In fairness to Fennell, the cinematography and soundtrack are both vivid and catchy. Fennell's 'vibe' and visual instinct would be perfect for a raunchy music video; she could even be described as a reasonable director in a such a role. But with Saltburn, her writing (and the movie's social media marketing) is aligned towards this new TikTok generation: vulgar, debased, and playing up to the soundbite-loving, shock-valued meme culture.Nothing of substance was made here.If you want dark-humoured social commentary, see Parasite. If you want sordid absurdity (with awkward sex scenes that actually benefit the plot!), see Dogtooth. And if you have completely lost touch with reality and think this movie is any way a piece of avant-garde artistry, I suggest you take a walk outside and remind yourself what a tree looks like. 0.0029772311022311098\n",

      "A scholarship student, Oliver Quick arrives at Oxford at the beginning of the film, and quite immediately it is underlined how he feels different from other students. Instead of shiny toys and loads of money hedonistically spent on alcohol and partying, Oliver seems rather shy. But, that changes when he meets a wealthy student named Felix. Quite rapidly both form a strong relationship, and Felix invites Oliver to his family home in Saltburn.It's where everything starts to go down. A quirky and unsurprising so far relationship seems to grow at rapid pace, surrounded by even weirder vibes from other family members. If Felix is a personification of a handsome, rich student, then his family is a bookish example of a group so rich, they constructed their own world in which they live in. With time, Oliver starts his own crusade against the family, which takes many wild turns in its two hours runtime.The world and story of Saltburn quickly becomes too abstract and over the top, but maybe that's the point. Emerald Fennell swiftly handles the horror and comedy elements of the movie, which provides a fascinating spectacle. You are terrified for a few moments, only to laugh it off shortly after, which makes you question Saltburn's reality and meaning even more. Although, it's fair to say some scenes play out in the truly oddest and most graphic fashion, often stealing the spotlight.Certain scenes in Saltburn are uncomfortable to watch, to say the least. On top of that, they sometimes happen without a warning, bringing an even bigger confusion to the viewers, who as a result, by the end of the movie, find it hard to name their feelings about it. I was originally one of them, and it surely takes a while to get your mind over Fennell's newest story.Besides being just gross at times, Saltburn does have its other flaws. Characters feel a bit too stereotypical, and it doesn't feel like the movie introduces anything new to the genre. The main character of Oliver, despite being stunningly played by Barry Keoghan, feels quite blank. His motive isn't as crystal clear as we would have wanted. The writing itself, like I mentioned, is controversial. Mixed together, Saltburn becomes a movie that may have tried to bite off more than it could chew.But it doesn't mean it doesn't have a good side. A couple of shots in this movie had my jaw drop to the floor, even though I had to pick it up after a few scenes. Additionally, while Keoghan definitely steals the show, other actors including Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike, and Richard E. Grant also bring solid performances.One of the final scenes of the movie includes Keoghan doing a celebratory, ecstatic dance in Saltburn after his achievements. I believe one of such achievements was messing with our minds as well. Do I think Saltburn is a good movie? I'm not entirely sure. Do I think it's worth watching and recommending? Certainly so. 0.1586492905242905\n",
      "This film ia way so good. Emerald Fennell's class-obsessed film is a deliciously twisty tale of grotesque overprivilege. Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi lead a gung-ho cast, which includes Carey Mulligan and Richard E Grant, who is having the time of his life. What ensues is a heady midsummer's nightmare at Felix's family home in the eponymous estate: a gargantuan manor where secrets line the many, many walls and every beautiful thing hides horrible truths and even more lies. It would be easy to dismiss it as an all-too familiar affair for Fennell, who graduated Oxford in 2007 and rarely shies away from her affluent upbringing - but Saltburn is so delicious in its twists, the gorgeously lensed disasters and endless farces, that it's impossible to ignore the work of a truly gifted and haywire filmmaker. 0.31203703703703695\n",
      "Inconsistent characterisations - most particularly the main character who was badly underexplored and mis-cast, no proper plot development, lots of stereotypes and no character to empathise with which is really hard to pull off in a film and this one fails on all counts. Incoherent, no dramatic tension and an ending you could see coming a mile off. A writer who believes that welding together a collection of stuff she has seen and liked in other films will do the trick, but you have to wonder what she was trying to say to her audience. Nothing of interest or note as far as I could make out. The sort of film that people might think they like because they can't really figure out what's wrong with it. Perhaps dazzled by style over content. The cinematography was good, but I think when you start to notice that, then it's because the narrative has lost you. A shame because I was looking forward to it, and it was a total and forgettable disappointment. -0.04259259259259259\n",
      "It's 2006. Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) is an outsider nerd in Oxford University. Most of the other students seem to be upper-crust from the cool kids' table. The head of that table is Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Oliver works to befriend Felix who invites Oliver to his family's estate called Saltburn to join his parents (Richard E. Grant, Rosamund Pike), his sister Venetia (Alison Oliver), his less-well-off cousin Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe), and Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan).This is Emerald Fennell's second directorial full length theatrical movie. She hit the first one out of the park with the critics and everybody is expecting a lot from her. I love this one more than \"Promising Young Woman\". That seems to be a minority opinion. Certainly, the style and the daring and the edge are all right there in both movies. In this one, I'm not questioning the reality of the situation.It all boils down to Barry Keoghan. His eyes are so unique. He looks both innocent and like a serial killer. From the beginning, I am assuming that he is inject little lies to get into the inner circle. I just couldn't understand his feelings for Felix. That's why I love his final explanation of both loving and hating him. I thought he had a misstep dealing with Venetia. He should have neg her by saying she failed his demand to eat. That would have kept her wrapped around his finger. The movie's biggest misstep is the section with the reveals. The first reveal of the bicycle tire is great. The money at the bar is interesting, but it's not that surprising. At the time, the audience thought he's poor, but by the end, we know he has middle class money. The Farleigh reveal is no reveal. Anybody with a brain knows what happened. The Felix reveal is only interesting in its details. The Venetia reveal is problematic in that her suicide needs to be expanded right away. By then, the audience knows Oliver is doing the killings. As for Elspeth, I would have prefer a marriage first and that murder is too blatant. The whole last act is a bit of a stumble, but I do love the rest. 0.18528184778184778\n",

If Oliver is unquestionably the main character (or even the only character if one accepts the other actors as props), then the film cannot be about high society, all its idiosyncrasies, etc. It's about Oliver and his object of desire. That object is not and is Felix, Venetia or Elspeth. That object is Saltburn (and what it represents in British Society), the title of the film. That is why the last scene represents Olivier finally penetrating fully naked Saltburn. But this journey is not easy for someone from a boring middle class background. As Olivier states at the end, \"Accidents {i.e. Naturally belonging there} are for people like you {Elspeth}. For the rest of us, there's work.\" In sum, the film is a rather amoral tale about how much work is necessary to achieve what one desires. In Olivier's case, it's Saltburn.

He did, however, expertly pull off embodying the contradictions of the character.This is a tale of what transpires when one covets another's status, wealth, and power and the extent to which such envy will test their morality.

Rosamund Pike was very good too. Overall, the acting was pretty fantastic all around. However, several glaring issues. Firstly, this movie has been done before, as many have mentioned, and better. The Talented Mr. Ripley and Parasite both exist and allegedly do a better job showcasing the ugly side of the rich than this film. This film, perhaps unintentionally (?) had me siding with the rich family over Barry every step of the way. Honestly, the other characters were far more unlikeable than the rich family. The nasty scenes were just that, nasty. Cheap, shock value stuff. I'm also concerned that Barry apparently improvised them, particularly the grave scene. Is he okay? Because I'm not. Not after watching that. It somehow felt outrageous and boring at the same time though. Not quite groundbreaking in its shock value, just low-hanging fruit. Also, the ending is just totally unbelievable, sorry. There is no way that Rosamund would, after the death of her immediate family, would just GIVE AWAY her entire familial estate to BARRY THE CREEP just because he comforted her when she was sad.

It attempts to compensate for these shortcomings with elaborate set design.Just one example (Spoiler):\n",
      "Oliver, the protagonist, who fails to have even one successful date on campus, suddenly exhibits a sexually charismatic and dominant persona, capable of bringing Farleigh Start, an alpha carefree cool kid, into submission. The scene is well-performed thanks to its superb actors, but it contradicts the core personality of the characters. The director suddenly bestows superpowers upon their underdog character, resulting in an unearned character twist. This instance is just one example of such inconsistencies throughout the film. 0.13157894736842102\n",
      "The movie is fantastic. There's a definite shortage of psychological thrillers in cinema, and that's what life is all about. We are surrounded by people, hence lies and intrigues. Yet, recent years there's mostly fantasy and sci-fi everywhere. Maybe the success of this film will convince scriptwriters and directors to return to themes of human relationships. The movie is beautiful - with great cinematography, well-painted characters, an interesting story, and and great ending with incredible, daring long scene.Generally, the movie, in its' character, gives off a strong vibe of Ripley.It engages you from start to finish and stays in your mind. 0.3880952380952381\n",
      "Ok let's address the elephant in the room regarding this film.The acting is terrific. Choosing actors with a certain level of fame and list of commercial films on their name is in my opinion pretty risky for more artistic films I would consider this one as. Most absolutely breathed their roles however.Except for.. Jacob. He seems like a great guy and I wish for him all the success he has.But it is obvious he was chosen for his current idolization and the fact that he always plays a similar kind of role.I like the way he comes over very natural in his acting, especially during the scene where he meets Oliver's parents. The joy he shows to be there, with the underlying anger showing in his eyes is obviously good acting. In other scenes, however, his reactions and presence in his character seem dulled down, inconsistent with a boy his age during that time, living his lifestyle. Especially regarding his weird family that mustn't have made his childhood very easy. He seems to me like the only cast member that might be slightly miscasted, as there would have been plenty of other men with a certain level of beauty, but able to bring more to the role.The cinematography sets an environment that looks extremely fictional, though beautiful. I would have liked a slightly more realistic feeling though. More background summer noises, more environmental shots instead of a reoccurring focus on the same close-up shots of the two main characters. Bringing across the 2006 vibe a little more would have been nice too. It was a very specific time that even at Oxford should maybe have been more noticeable.The story itself is good. It builds on shock value, at times trying very hard to leave the viewer in a state of shock. It worked a little because some scenes in this film will be bizarre to everyone living on this planet. It will make you not only dislike the main character, but also completely desensitize from him. Seeing him as an outcast, a psychopath even. There is no reason given as to why he has such hatred for this particular family. They treated him badly but then again they treated everyone badly, including each other, and with his level of intelligence he knew better than to take things personal.I also feel like the writers took a lot of inspiration from 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and 'Parasite'. Essentially combining two movies into one with a new concept and a different kind of ending... or is it?Other films with a similar concept leave the ending rather open. Leaving the viewer to question the characters moral decisions. You also get to know the characters better usually, as complicated as they may be.Ollie was mysterious, but too mysterious. To the point where he should be taken out of society because he is dangerous. And everyone around him would have noticed this.There is no family that would inherit the estate? No family that would think it's odd this guy shows up, everyone dies and he inherits all? No court battles, no one questioning his weirdness or the reason why he was asked to leave in the first place? Also where is the American guy in all of this?Wouldn't there have been media coverage and public outrage? A whole family dying, and the guy present for all of it, who has a track record of lying to all of his Oxford mates about his life, gets to inherit all? It just seems too fictional.Again I'd like to say that the acting was superb. The lunch scene after Felix died, wow. The way they all portray grief is incredible... But it doesn't come close to \"The Talented Mr. Ripley' in terms of certain feelings being brought over, realness, and this eery feeling you're being left with at the end of it. 0.1557329381477108\n",
      "SALTBURN - BEST film for a very long time. Thrilling, funny and fierce. So refreshing to see new actors too. Emerald Lilly Fennell is an English actress, filmmaker, and writer; and she wrote and directed this masterpiece. It is partly parodic, and the reflection of Evelyn Waugh's Bridehead is consciously used. The script is stunning, and subtle. It illuminates human behaviour in the social classes and the erosion of that divide which is typical of the last seventy years. She has received many awards and nominations, including an Academy Award, two British Academy Film Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award, and nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. The movie is gorgeously shot, the actors are brilliant and intelligent enough to know they have a wonderful script to work with0. This is the best movie I've seen for a long time. 0.30644570707070706\n",
      "\"Saltburn\" can be many things: psychological thriller, social satire, dark comedy, erotic trip (almost to the extent of big-screen porn), maybe more. But, at the end of the day, style trumps substance. The movie ends up looking like a super-long music video, beautifully shot. This is not to say, however, that there is no plot.The movie moves around its central character Oliver (Barry Keoghan). More specifically, it is about the relationship between Oscar and the title object, Saltburn. Appearing half an hour into the movie, Saltburn is a plush estate in the English countryside, where Oliver has been invited by Oxford classmate Felix to stay in the summer, to hopefully alleviate agonies after his father's death. The first half hour of the movie takes place in Oxford, tracing the first encounter and the subsequent development of friendship (or maybe more) between the two young men. Felix is the born-with-silver-spoon-in-mouth type. Oliver is a common folk, often appearing as nerdy and clueless, although academically, he is a budding scholar at Oxford.As the door of Saltburn opens to Oliver's knock, stone-faced butler Duncan appears, and immediately tells him off for arriving earlier than expected. Felix comes to the rescue, jesting \"Duncan, stop being so frightening\". After a guided tour, Oliver is brought to the living room to meet the other players at Saltburn. A close-up of a conversation shows two glamorous top-notch stars, Rosamund Pike playing Felix's mother Elspeth and Carey Mulligan playing a frequent guest \"Poor Dear Pamela\". We see also Felix's standoffish father and erotic sister. Of the other guest, the one standing out is Oxford classmate Farleigh, whose favored place with the Saltburn population seems to be threatened by the arrival of Oliver, as sort of a new toy to these elite people.I am not going to elaborate the interaction of Oliver with the various characters during this summer escapade in Saltburn. Quite a lot of those are erotic, as I mentioned, and some even lethal. And, as I also mentioned, despite the somewhat fragmented and haphazard narrative, there is a plot.There is no question that Saltburn is Keoghan's movie. Oliver is a bit of an enigma. It is no exaggeration to say that Keoghan's interpretation of this character drives the movie. Pike, always a delight to watch, does not have as much challenge as in many of her other iconic movies. It's sheer joy, of course, to see Mulligan (I did not even know she was in this movie). It's a pity that she has only a few scenes, less than many of the other support characters. But this is a Mulligan I have not seen before and I would not spoil it by saying anything further.While \"Saltburn\" is not everybody's cup of tea, none can dispute its stylish achievement in cinematography and product design. And there are Pike and Mulligan, even though it is not anywhere near any of their important work. 0.17081014223871369\n",
      "This was a crazy train; very true to what we would expect (and want) from this author. I can't say I like it more than PYW, but it's hecka close. This OG cast was beyond, and the newbies were all perfectly cast. I typically hate feeling so awkward watching a movie but could not tear myself away from this film. It's extreme bougie, in its truest sense - which was fun. The opulence was strangely understated - but vulgar at the same time. This was my first introduction to Barry and I will now enjoy searching for his movies. Quite the powerhouse. He feels like a subtle tsunami that comes when it's darkest. -0.021666666666666664\n",

      "Mildly disturbing, weird, and the characters freaked me out. Okay I like the style this was filmed and the angles and set design/costume design but I did not like the plot. Oliver was a confusing prick and a real creep too. He drinks is only friends watered down semen then gave said friends sister head all before killing them all. His whole point in the long run was very confusing, he wanted to end up rich and lonely and die alone in a house he got from ruining the families lives. The other characters were better but still just as confusing. Farliegh (idk how to spell it) was a spoiled brat and wanted all of the parents attention to himself he hated Oliver from the beginning before he even saw him do anything. Felix was just a playboy who loves to show off how much money he has(but he is one of the best characters arguably) and Venitia(also don't know how to spell it I'm very dyslexic) is a confusing pretty girl who will do anything for someone to like her( her death did make me cry though it was very sad).

      "1) Oxford: the introduction\n",
      "2)Saltburn: where it builds up\n",
      "3)The killings: twist and conclusion.Well, the first part is not really building much for the story, just presenting half of the characters. So without knowing where the movie was going all along this part, it felt maybe too long for an introduction.Second half it's where it gets interesting, and during all its duration it's giving you hints of some kind of conspiracy between the familly towards Oliver.Now it's were I find the major problem, all those hints are threw away to hit you with the twist.But first, I really wanted to know what all those hints were about. Mostly by Venettia interactions: \"I like you more than the last year one\" , \"I see now why he likes you...(suspense pause)...you are real\" ; The interest of the familly on the details of Oliver's background, the satanic figures at the party... All seemed to be pointing to some sort of witchcraft ritual, a weird familly tradition or something similar... And if all of this was just to say that Alex brings a new friend every year it feels a really empty explanation for the tension build.And then the third part. The twist seems just really lazy scripting. It's presented as if everything was meticulously planned and Oliver is a genious. But every and each of the steps were extremely subject to random factors that really felt improvised.I think it would have been way more credible and satisfactory if the acts were presented as acted on the go insted of all planned.On the positive side, the visuals and the acting are great. Soundtrack it's good too. Each shot it's a painting, so it can be enjoyed just by the visual pleasure.Would have been a 6 of it weren't by the cinematography, and an 8 if the story and the rythm were more thoughtful.So I rate it 7/10. 0.1583677685950413\n",
      "This film is an enthralling drama, remarkable for its unpredictability and intense emotional depth. It's not for the faint-hearted, as it skillfully weaves a narrative that's both intensely moving and beautifully grim. The movie excels in immersing its audience, demanding multiple viewings to appreciate the complex artistic details hidden within.At the heart of the story is Oliver, a character so richly developed that he blurs the lines between hero and villain. His complex nature and the film's nuanced perspective on his character add layers of intrigue and depth.

      "Fantastic acting and cinematography ultimately undone by a script that alternates between feeling hollow and ridiculously outlandish. No real substance to the movie, just shock value for the sake of shock value. Honestly still quite enjoyable despite that until the final twenty minutes or so of the movie, which as others have said requires a pretty massive suspension of disbelief.I think it would be near impossible to watch this movie and not come away thinking it should have been much better than it was.I need eight six more characters to post this review.

      "This movie was unnecessarily gross. It could've been a realistic look at the aristocratic life... but it went for gross shock value instead. There was an opportunity to tell the story of how the rich live and how easily the poor are discarded... and maybe even how someone takes revenge on behalf of the lower class. But that was either not the intention or they just missed the mark. The lead actor, Barry Keoghan, turns in an incredible performance but it wasn't enough to make this movie worth watching. Beyond the gross shock-value there were characters introduced that never had a proper closure and didn't even seem to fit in the story. It seemed like someone got high and wrote what came to mind then turned it into a movie to waste all of our time. Don't listen to your friends when they tell you to watch it. 0.15142424242424243\n",
      "An excellent plot combined with superb acting culminates to a fantastic watch. With reference's throughout to mythology and with an element of satire makes this an interesting one of a kind cinematic piece. Plenty of twists and turns throughout but those are only a surprise when you keep an open mind when watching the film, if you are presumptuous in what will happen next then it removes the suspense for the viewer. The film does a fantastic job of portraying the higher class of society with extravagance and over dressing throughout the film. In addition with the under dressed element reflecting self confidence and perhaps the luxury of having significant wealth without having to worry about money. Great watch for any film fanatics! 0.3946428571428572\n",
      "Ok the film is stylish and entertaining despite the final act dipping then picking up again for the ending. Great for a kickback viewing this holiday season but after all is said and done half way through the film I felt something was missing. If you're going to make satire and social commentary by all means go for it without being preachy. This film tries to push the envelope for the genre but falls short. It's very stylish with standout performances by Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Richard E. Grant, and Rosamund Pike. Theres a stellar supporting cast including Carey Mulligan but I can't help by shake the feeling and impression that the story fell short of really being good. There are moments of brilliance but short lived and while I enjoy a fun rollercoaster ride this was one ride I couldn't wait to get off. There's a few surprises at the end and Barry's character keeps revealing his psychopathic behavior in that dark comedic way. The grave scene is something to behold. 0.18484848484848485\n",

I realize this early on in the movie and I hoped that they would've pulled it off better than they did. But they didn't! You are better spending your time watching the talented Mr. Ripley. In that movie you at least get to be tuned in to Matt Damon's deceit and the world response around him. Here you are left to use your imagination and assume until the end.

I love it when stories surprise me.Felix is a lovely character however his family is a buffet of wealth snobbery and it's bloody good fun to watch. The music is really nice too! I have to add that I adored the final scene. It is delicious!!!!The acting is superb on all accounts. The writing is excellent.

      "Watched this movie on Prime Video - it sounded interesting from the description, but it was definitely nothing like what I'd expected. I thought it would be about dark manipulative dealings of the rich aristocrats, but the movie goes on and on and on for over an hour, weird and occasionally dull, with no real dramatic conflict showing up (a few times you think it's a gay themed movie), and after that it turns out that the poor (well, middle-class) guy is the evil one, manipulating the wealthy aristocrats out of their money.So, the writer/director coming from wealth herself, this is a movie for rich folks, confirming their paranoid fear that absolutely everyone (who isn't rich like them) are out to get their money, and that none of them can be trusted, because they only want one thing from you: MONAAAYY!! A story that will just make rich people even more paranoid and unwilling to share their obscene wealth. I mean, what else can this movie be saying? There were some weird elements to Promising Young Woman as well, and they are certainly here, too. The underlying logic (assuming there is one) is hard to parse. In Saltburn, it is never clear whether Oliver or the aristocrats are the bad guys. We can only assume that Oliver, murdering the aristocrats, is the bad guy, yet how do we know he isn't a rebelling oppressed worker who's just casting off the yoke of the corrupt rich elite? But we don't. The movie isn't clear on this. Is Oliver just a gold-digger, or is he a revolutionary? Does the writer/director even know? That's what I'd like to know! -0.028763640873015875\n",

Oliver is so disgustingly human, so disgustingly borderline that I almost had to stop watching. Not because it was \"disturbing\" but because it was the ugliest parts of myself that i saw upon that screen. The part of me that is violently and obsessive but also hopelessly in love. It made my skin crawl, to watch this movie and now that i feel the same. I love you, i love you so much that i hate you. I love you so much that i want to BE you.

But in a good way. It added a good cringe to the movie. It was just a bit slow for the mystery to start. That had me bored and ready to turn the movie off. But it's a good watch.

      "This is a film best watched alone lest you be distracted by the intakes of breath by the person setting next to you, for it's not without some uncomfortable scenes. It's a unique take on a buddy movie as the handsome and rich gentry boy takes pity on the poor scholarship boy with a muffled Scouser accent and whose parents are addicts back in Liverpool. After his old man has just succumbed to his habits, rich boy invites poor boy to his majestic period mansion (no pun intended) for the Summer. The rest of the film thrives on ambiguity since the poor loner boy (played brilliantly by Barry Keoghan) has already ensnared us with sympathy back in Oxford - not even able to afford a round of drinks in the King's Arms - and as a fish out of water, how now is he going to survive in a world of eccentric richies in a sprawling mansion fit for a King. But it's a world where everything is not as it seems and it all unfolds in an intriguing and haunting way.

Boarderline misleading maybe at times, because you could have interpreted the weird and over the top as him trying to be in control and spin from there. But in the end it didnt matter. I liked the ending, because I would DEFINATELY have done the same thing! I just started laughing when I saw that. Maybe a bit more of the cunning could have been highlighted.

      "Saltburn, there were many things about this film I was looking forward to that I knew prior to watching this film, this being the cast in; Barry Keoghan, having seen his previous work in Banshees of Inisherin, Jacob Elordi, I was looking forward to seeing him in a role that was a bit more character driven compared to his previous work in films such as the kissing booth, not to speak down on films like that I was just intrigued in seeing more of his acting range and capabilities. I was also interested in seeing the performance of Archie Madekwe, as I had seen his performance Gran Turismo, and I am enjoying watching him come up in acting. There were a lot of positive aspects of this film in the acting, the narrative and the ways it touched certain themes and topics, the visual style in the cinematography,etc. However there were some aspects of this film that were not as effective as they could've been in my opinion, I will go into all of this in this review.Let me start with the acting performances; Rosamund Pike, the actress who played Elspeth Catton, she played this character with a certain obliviousness, similar to the performance of Cho Yeo-jeong, who plays the mother in the film Parasite. Which brings me to a point I wanted to make which is the similarities between these two films. However, going back to her performance, I thought she used a certain charisma that really made her character very comedic in certain scenes, but in some cases it made her character not as convincing as some of the other characters, her being so disconnected from the reality outside of her day to day life. Another performance I want to talk about, is Jacob Elordi's, I thought it was great to be honest, his accent was not bad at all and he really created a convincing character that I could sympathize with. His character was not as deep or complex, in fact he is on the more simple and one dimensional side, but I believed Jacob Elordi portrayed his character effectively. I also want to speak about the performance of Alison Oliver who played Venetia. She played her character so well, it was amazing, a scene that was a stand out for me was her bathtub monologue, as she talked to Oliver after Felix's death. Her character always seemed so interesting yet strangely human, even with her screen time being lesser than other characters. Finally I want to touch on Barry Keoghan's performance, it was intriguing, however his character felt a little spread thin. I believe a television series format would be more suited to fully flesh out this character, but still his performance was very effective and created that interest and mystery to the character.I now want to touch on the beautiful visual aspects of this film. This film utilizes a square aspect ratio (1.33:1), the director and producers, Emerald Fennell used this aspect ratio as a way of \"peeping in\" on the characters. There are a lot of shots that utilize back lighting, which create powerful and striking images within the narrative. Additionally due to the more square aspect ratio the use of the central framing was more effective for me in the film. Furthermore, the use of the setting and props in the cinematography was very effective, especially for the framing and composition. For example if there is a shot that utilizes a reflective table, it creates a feeling that something is wrong within the scene. In terms of the lighting, the use of color works in setting the mood and atmosphere of the scene.A comparison I could make in the storyline or concept is, to the film parasite which I mentioned before. I did enjoy this film, in the ways that I have explained, but there are some aspects of this film that didn't work as much as they could've for me. One problem for me is that this film tries to touch on A LOT within around 2 hours, from obsession to grief to the difference between higher and lower classes, etc. And it doesn't fully explore all of these themes to the point where this narrative could become really effective. I believe the cast and their chemistry were utilized but could've been utilized more to make their deaths feel more effective, meaningful and impactful. The ending felt a little bit explanatory, the twist that Oliver was killing all of them was something that could've been seen from a lot earlier in the plot. If they were going to treat the ending like it was a twist they should've hidden Oliver's true intentions within the storyline a bit better, just so it was that much more shocking and effective for the audience. 0.20111075036075032\n",

      "This movie is admiringly one of the strangest things I've ever seen. But, I'm not easily disturbed which is why I am not totally freaked out since I have watched FAR MORE weird movies than this. I'm not going to name them because they are highly disturbing and I wish I never watched them.The plot of this movie at the start is slightly slow and made it hard to enjoy but once things start happening, you become strangely drawn in. The movie itself is like it's manipulating you the way Oliver did to Felix- so in a way you are in Felix's position (without the bathtub scene-).The thing I truly loved about this movie was the camera work and cinematography all together. From the colouring to ever shot- it is so well thought out and just beautiful to watch.I personally love when they have just graduated and we have a beautiful building in centre frame with Oliver in front of it but not covering it. It stays on that scene for around 20 seconds as different characters come past the camera in and out of the shot. It was so beautiful to watch because that beautiful building is just presented to you with the side of Oliver and other characters. By far my favourite scene.Murder of the dance floor is on every one of my playlists and now unfortunately all I can think about is a naked Bar dancing through a house.I'm not even going to comment on the 'lucky I'm a vampire' scene :) 0.15833333333333335\n",

The issue for me was in the second half of the film, the plot begins to lose its coherence until you hit the end where everything falls apart. You could leave frustrated, feeling unfulfilled because of the final act, It's hard to believe, it doesn't make much sense in real life.As other reviews mention it isn't an original plot twist, you can forsee it, you've seen it in other movies or read in books. 0.05777777777777778\n",

They seem like they've been written by a psychopathic 15 year old girl. The movie tries to be dark, but it looks and feels like a lonely, unhinged teen wrote it on poppers in the back of a bad disco. It's trying to be different and surprising, but it's just boring and pathetic. I miss the days when I left a film feeling something other than... eeew, why, terrible people, no protagonists, why was this made, who was this made for, why are people raving about this?

      "I loved the atmosphere of saltburn and I thought the behaviour of the toffs was both funny and authentic. Also the way the story gradually tipped into a psychotic place was quite satisfying.However there are some problems with the last third of the movie. It doesn't feel remotely credible that Ollie should get away so easily with the murder of Felix. He's never shown collecting any kind of poison. What is it? Fentanyl? Ricin? What kills Felix so instantly? We're told that a coroner is on site but apparently they don't care about cause of death. Nobody investigated the bottle for poison? What about the girl who SAW OLLIE WITH FELIX moments before his death? If a beloved member of your family died mysteriously you probably would investigate, but apparently not in this case.Similar problem with the death of Vee. She doesn't seem particularly close to killing herself so it's hard to believe that Ollie simply drove her there with some evil words. And if in fact it was him who killed her then there would have been some evidence. Footprints etc outside the bathtub.In a nutshell: these two murders are not explained well and it's ludicrous that any parents would shrug off the mysterious death of both their children. There's also characters like Duncan and Farley who are rightfully suspicious of Ollie, but disappear from the story. Why did they give up so easily? Surely they have a stake in this? 0.10378787878787878\n",

I think that the outcome was predictable though but what was lost in the bland ooo plot twist of an end was balanced out with the ongoing surprises and \"crazy\" events that go on. The cinematography and use of colors is amazing and was the type of film where I just wanted to look at it for as long as possible. I think that people have praised this movie in odd ways and people have been dramatic about how it's disturbing but in reality it's decently tame and just has a bit of violence and sexual content.

      "Alright, so the movie's got a decent story, but you can pretty much guess what's gonna happen way too early. They should've trimmed it down to keep things interesting. And seriously, they go way overboard trying to make British high society look all modern and cool - it just feels fake. The never-ending parties and good times take up way too much screen time, stealing the spotlight from the actual plot.Props to the actors, though, especially Barry Keoghan - that guy's a legend and makes the scenes worth watching. But the director seems dead set on dragging out the storyline unnecessarily, and then, out of the blue, the last 10 minutes are a mad rush to wrap things up.

Finally last night I watched it and it's a great movie. I kept saying wth is going on, why is he doing that, and trying to see their intentions as it went on but in a very good way. I liked watching the evolution of the plot and how it grew darker as it went on. How the original intention of the characters shifted and evolved and plans were formulated based on the introduction of the characters. The actors did a great job, the characters were interesting and fleshed out, the cinematography was beautiful, and I have to see it again to catch what I missed. Barry and Jacob did a great job as the typical rich boy poor boy narrative, the unrequited love, the friends that think he doesn't belong their because of status, the rich intrigued by someone real and not bored, rich, and spoiled. None of that was new in movie tropes but it was done well and believably. So many emptions and conflicted feelings inbthe characters. I enjoyed it a lot. 8/10. 0.2540268065268066\n",

The second hour you start to get somewhere. 45 minutes remaining is when things start to happen. There was no build up of the mc's behavior before that second hour. Even the end doesn't really give you much of an explanation to his actions. It was just weird, the mc was weird, and the family was eccentric. The family was likable (imo) and was hospitable and could be forceful when they wanted to be but not when they needed to be or should have been. Sometimes you can forgive the flaws in a movie if it's worthwhile but not in this one. So to sum up, It's a bit boring in the beginning, then the mc starts to be a manipulative here and there, then you have to wait until the last 45 minutes of the movie to get anywhere, then the end is just unsatisfying. 0.03437499999999999\n",

I think Emerald did some rather exceptional research and I applaud her. Saltburn will be unforgettable for anyone who is brave enough to watch it.

      "Like Promising Young Woman (an erroneous Oscar winner) Saltburn reads like the first draft of a screenplay with unclear intentions. The plot and its meaning are muddy and lack both conviction and wisdom. The way I see it, there are 3 different ways to try to make sense of the themes and events that unfold:This is simply a thriller about a vampire. A cuckoo begins laying his eggs in a nest that doesn't belong to him, destroying its inhabitants and taking the nest for himself. There's no underpinning commentary about society, class structure and class struggles. You can enjoy the film at face value. There are certainly vampiric motifs utilised in places: notably the red gothic font used for 'Saltburn' in the opening credits and posters, and of course the infamous period sex scene. Felix dressed in angel wings and Oliver in antlers i.e. Horns at the costume party is a fairly obvious depiction of good vs evil as well.This is supposed to be an eat the rich commentary about an inherently flawed class system and those who fall victim to it; how wealth corrupts not only those who have it, but also those who are shut out of it. On an eat the rich interpretation I suppose we are to somehow align with Oliver, a character who is ostensibly overthrowing and reclaiming generational wealth and status from a group of people who didn't deserve it in the first place. Oliver should be vindicated for toppling this dynasty and destroying the Cattons, question mark?Why does this objective fail to work? Primarily because a huge plot point and quote unquote twist is that Oliver turns out not to be working class or particularly disadvantaged but a middle class boy with doting parents. This shatters any characterisation of him as a foredoomed casualty of a structure that failed him. The film struggles to find its feet as a quasi-revenge flick after this revelation because any desire he has to destroy the family and take the throne has lost its charm.Fennell has either intentionally or inadvertently created a cautionary tale to the very wealthy about mouths poised to bite the hand that feeds them. It's not a story about a person with nothing who seeks restitution from a family imbued with extreme privilege, but a story about a middle class boy who wanted what he didn't have. Perhaps who 'wanted what everyone wants', what money can't buy but wealth affords: status, charm, charisma, beauty, spectacle.The Cattons aren't vicious, they're kind of just witless quarry. Yes, they're callous at times, out of touch, self-centred and hedonistic, but this is all played as fairly vapid or at worst a bit yucky. In real life, how do the rich stay rich? By shutting out those who aren't like them. Sure, Oliver is treated like a bit of a pathetic plaything, and Elspeth's good graces for Pamela run out, but crucially, they are allowed in.Even more poignantly, Oliver is never really sufficiently downtrodden to be our anti-hero. He is calculating and depraved, acting upon an insatiable lust for the family, what they have, and what they represent. He's cold and he's manipulative, and actually we're not really shown what draws the family to him at all. Ultimately the Cattons are presented as vacuous victims, besieged by a vindictive sociopath who is given an inch and takes a mile.I'm highly doubtful that this 'cautionary tale to the rich'' diagnosis reflects Fennell's intent, but I do think it's the direction the film naturally sends itself in, and I think it's the most uncomfortably compelling way to watch. 'Eat the rich' is nothing new, but an outright omen to society's elite (from someone who does essentially belong to that class) is kind of disgustingly fresh. It seems to say 'there are 2 types of people in this world: those who have it, and those who want it', and doubles down on how those who want it will go to great and unthinkable lengths to acquire it. Unfortunately, my gut feeling is that she resolved to write an eat the rich fable, which was ill-fated in her hands I'm afraid, and wound up with something either incoherent or accidentally flipped on its head.Finally, there is of course the possibility that this is literally supposed to be a rip off of Ripley, a story about a boy who became so infatuated by the high life and the people in it that he'd do whatever he could to hold onto it. Felix does only seem to be killed because he found out Oliver's secret. So, was the original plan only to infiltrate and not to conquer? And then it goes wrong? Except Oliver fails to mention this in his intelligence-insulting final 'here's how I done it' soliloquy. The Ripley rip off was shattered for me from the moment Oliver sent back his eggs. 0.004022005772005771\n",

I mean obviously it's beautiful if you have folks on Pinterest making boards based off of \"Saltburn Aesthetics.\" It has this older, grainy type of film that really makes the audience feel more attached to the story as a whole.Honestly I do think the story was overhyped though. Nothing felt riveting? There were things that I didn't expect and things I did.I expected more of a queer outlook on the show because of what I'd heard from others but I was fairly wrong (though that doesn't really change my outlook on the story as a whole, especially considering that if it were queer I can't see it becoming queer in a friendly or 'consensual' way because of how Oliver treated Felix).I really enjoyed the psychological aspect of the film overall. The ending was pretty smart, which I happened to enjoy. It was definitely a twist I didn't expect to see.I definitely think there are aspects of the film that folks are overly dramatic about?

The mere mention of the incomparable Brideshead Revisited in the same breath is near blasphemy. The characters are devoid of any dimension and lack motivation in their robotic machinations. Some scenes are slow and agonizingly long, while some scenes that have a whiff of emotion, such as when Oliver and Felix go to Oliver's parents, are frustratingly cut short of development and resolution. Moreover, Barry Keoghan as super Oxford student is about as convincing as Elizabeth Warren's assertion that she is a Cherokee Indian. Thankfully there is Jacob Elordi whose raffish good looks and spirited performance, as well as that of Rosalind Pike., bring much needed relief to the absurd proceedings.

The film doesn't really develop this.Is Oliver a born sociopath? Does he just enjoy toying with these rich,dull rather thick poshos?Despite these flaws Saltburn is a well done, well photographed film that is too long and suffers from a sluggish second act but the acting especially by Keoughan saves it and there is a grim relish watching these obnoxious charactersmeet their fate.Obviously it ain't Kind Hearts and Coronets! 0.0071428571428571435\n",
      "She's a mischief maker, that Emerald Fennell.Last year, the versatile English actress, writer and director won a bunch of awards, including an Oscar for writing \"Promising Young Woman.\" It was a wry tale of gender vengeance featuring Carey Mulligan as a med school dropout who finds brilliant ways of settling scores with the perpetrators of a gang rape of her classmate. Actually, her target was more like men in general.Now Fennell's back with \"Saltburn,\" another diabolical tale of settling scores that dances precariously on the line between black comedy and horror show. It's brilliantly written, dangerously sensual, sumptuous to watch, and thoroughly unsettling - that's the point.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver Quick, a bright young Oxford student often at the mercy or the butt of the joke for wealthy, legacy classmates like snobby Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe). Seemingly comfortable enough in the role of nerdy outcast in his scholarship wardrobe, his fortunes change when he is befriended by classmate Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Felix is everything that Oliver isn't - obscenely wealthy, charismatic beyond belief, catnip for any woman in sight, utterly assured in every moment.The friendship begins with an act of giving on Oliver's part, but is that enough to explain Felix's endless generosity in return? They're hardly equals, but the rich son of nobility keeps acting as though they are.Are friends just playthings for Felix? Is their improbable relationship love, or lust, or what?We suspect we're going to find out ... but we're not sure we want to.The enigmas mount after Felix invites Oliver to his family's opulent estate - Saltburn - for the summer.In endless corridors lined with original art and folio editions of Shakespeare, Oliver is greeted by the family, a decadent bunch for sure. When he first meets Felix's father, Sir James Catton (Richard E. Grant), he's giggling like an eighth grader watching a video of \"Superbad.\"\n",
      "Sir James is in the library with his loquacious wife Elspeth (a terrific Rosamund Pike), who calls everyone \"darling,\" but can barely wait for them to leave the room to start talking about them. Her first such target, played by Carey Mulligan, is identified in the credits as Poor Dear Pamela. The coterie includes daughter Venetia (Alison Oliver), pouty and blond, Oliver's first seduction just waiting to happen.Farleigh Start, Oliver's nemesis from Oxford, is here, too. He's a cousin, his status something between family member and freeloader. Symbiotic relationships - people using, or misusing, or toying with or otherwise exploiting each other - are as close as the Cattons can come to family ties, as they while away the summer in alcohol and swimming spots and one debauchery after another.Beginning with Keoghan, last seen earning an supporting-actor Oscar nomination for \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" the performances are wicked and delicious.Underpinning them all is the peculiar bond between Oliver and Felix. Oliver talks to the camera periodically - a device director Fennell uses to frame the narrative - seeking the distinction between loving and being in love. But we suspect that neither he nor we are getting to the sordid depths of the matter.Fennell as a smart, stylish filmmaker, whether it comes to probing psyches or orchestrating amazing tracking shots, going from room to room or building to building, sometimes with scores of extras in the background. She is a master of ambiguity, not tying up loose ends but rather letting questions of character linger.The fact that she has a devilish sense of humor is another plus ... or drawback if you don't have the stomach for \"Saltburn's\" eat-the-rich school of comedy. 0.17638583638583638\n",

Felix invites Oliver to his home Saltburn where the family are completely eccentric. Rosamund Pike plays Felix's mother and Richard E Grant plays his father. They are absolutely hilarious. I won't give away any of the story,but what follows is entertaining, funny and downright weird at times. A couple of scenes will have you squirming in your seat but I thought it was one of the best movies of the year. Barry Keoghan deserves to be nominated for so many awards for this performance. He is mesmerising. Some people really don't like this movie which is down to personal taste,but I have already watched it 3 times and loved it every time. 0.2781746031746032\n",
      "The first 45 minutes or so of this film promised much but sadly it became sillier and sillier such that by the end it didn't really amount to much more in the latter parts than a stylishly produced series of scenes presumably meant to either shock or titillate the viewer but not really managing either. It became a bit like an x rated Mr Ripley Returns. Ironically it all starts to fall apart shortly after Oliver's arrival at Saltburn. There is no doubting that the central performances are very good but overall this is a superficial film, stylishly produced but with no real substance to it and not really worthy of the hype that surrounds it. 0.13708333333333333\n",
      "This movie is excessively revolting and repulsive for the sole purpose of being so. The shocking scenes serve no real purpose other than to disgust the audience. Its one of the worst movies I have ever seen imo, and it showcases the absolute degeneracy of modern cinema.There is not a single redeeming quality about it, and it leaves you feeling like you need to take 2 showers in a row. The 'twist' is not even that, any one could see it a mile away. How this crap gets any recognition or praise is really beyond me.I would recommend avoiding it at all costs and not believing any hype about this trash. -0.17827380952380953\n",

Barry Keoghan is the finest young actor working today on par with all-time greats like Marlon Brando, Joaquin Phoenix and Sam Rockwell. All that being said, this is one of the darkest, most grotesque and hauntingly disturbing films I've ever seen. I gave it a high star rating because it is well made.

The narrative gracefully navigates a complex web of twists and turns that captivate the audience, making it an engaging watch. However, the film does not shy away from two scenes that transcend mere cringe, venturing into the realm of shock. Yet, these unsettling moments, while discomforting, undeniably contribute to the film's overarching objectives. The impeccable execution keeps viewers irresistibly drawn into the plot, creating an experience that, despite its discomfort, remains thoroughly entertaining.

The movie is almost a hybrid of The Talented Mr Ripley with a smattering of Brideshead Revisited. The bawdiness, on full display, is almost Shakespearean, it's absolutely hilarious at times. When Oliver asks for \"eggs over easy\" , because it's a kind of American cool thing to say and impress the hosts, the butler gives him two raw eggs ! I was laughing like a drain at that point.

A bit contrived in places like the end, but enjoyable for the cinematrography and top actors.

And the police must be halfwits in saltburns part of the country.Also the main character wasn't very good looking or even normal looking, but rest fo cast were spot on, rosamund pike was delightful i could watch her act all day long, richard e grant held his own.Im not sure what farlleigh stark was doing there, maybe to fill the inclusivity part of the grant to film, i think if a character is supposed to be gay, they should show him actually having sex with a man adn not just wanking on a grave.But all in all id watch it again, maybe to see if i can spot the secret things whats his name was doing. 0.10916666666666665\n",
      "Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh is one of my favorite novels, and I've seen both the 2008 film as well as the 1980s BBC mini-series, so I immediately recognized Saltburn was Brideshead \"updated\" for the 21st century just from seeing the trailers. I waited for it to come on streaming because I was curious but not optimistic. While stylish and peppered with memorable 2000s music for Millennials in the first half of the film, the second half of the film is just gross on purpose. Something about a bathtub drain, I actually had to turn down the volume on my device because I didn't want to hear the nasty slurping sounds of some dork tonguing a dirty plumbing pipe, and it just gets worse not ten minutes later with the clueless virgin Oliver taking advantage of Felix's emotionally unstable sister Venetia hours after a tete-a-tete with her narcissistic mother.Saltburn tries too hard and just ends up playing victim to a sub-generation of people who have mistaken shock value for something intelligent to say. In the original Brideshead Revisited, complex moral questions are visited and there's an emphasis on something other than sex (though it is a racy book for the early 20th century era it was published). Also, Felix is no match for the charismatic and childishly fey Lord Sebastian Flyte.Don't be in a rush to see this one. -0.005185185185185195\n"

The plot was nice, we didn't see it coming from Oliver, but how did the family not suspect anything? Or anyone? Not even the maids. Cinematography was ok but it didn't give 2006 vibes at all, it's obvious they were trying hard to, but it didn't come out as such. The clothes and the aesthetic were chaotic.

      "I didn't really understand why this film was so hyped up, until I finally watched it. It's a beautiful mix of dark, twisted, gritty hunour , funny and sweet troubled characters, and the harsh yet real life many of us have suffered or seen others suffer. You cleverly get to know each character without prolonged history and dialogue. I wish more writers were this daring, media has become so bland In the past few years and no-one wants to push the boundaries for fear of upsetting conservative ideologies. I'll re-watch this time and time again and some of the scenes are imprinted for a multitude of reasons. Bravo to the directors, producers and actors. 0.06944444444444445\n",
      "It's a decent way to pass time, but I only watched it bc everyone on TikTok was saying how crazy it is. I guess they haven't watched many movies or shows in the past 30 years, but this was tame and didn't cover any turf that hasn't already been covered a million times. Entertaining but certainly not shocking or groundbreaking. It is always interesting though to see a story of how the other half (1%) live and this doesn't disappoint from that aspect, in the UK. A couple of scenes have put this one on the map for shock value but not memorable. If you don't find the guy from euphoria attractive then this is even less of a draw. 0.08853535353535354\n",
      "Saltburn tells the story of Oliver, an awkward young man who befriends a rich guy at Oxford and meets his odd, entitled family.At first, the movie is quite good. Barry Keoghan is ecellent as the awkward working class protagonist struggling to keep up with the upper classes. Jacob Elordi is appropriately charming. The folks at Saltburn all do great playing different flavors of odd - I particularly like Alison Oliver as the sister.The movie is perhaps at its most entertaining when it first gets to the rich guy's home, a crazy mansion at Saltburn filled with snotty, gossipy, and profoundly weird characters. At the same time, I think that's when things start to go off the rails, because up until then the people felt fairly real but the family is quite cartoonish. It's the time when I started wondering - what exactly *is* this movie?The bigger problem turns out to be the character(s) of Oliver. It's not that he isn't who he seems to be - that's a perfectly acceptable and not especially shocking twist. The issue is that his character shifts in weird ways. He's awkward and shy. He's weirdly mesmerizing and powerful. He's nice and friendly. He's creepy. And he just switches from one to the next and back with no one seeming to think it's weird or wondering why he's a totally different person than he was five hours ago. They should all be saying, hey, do you think Oliver has multiple personalities? But they don't. (And he doesn't - he's just badly written.)Then there's the actual story, which culminates with a lot of death that no one finds suspicious and that, judging by the \"big reveal\" sequence at the end, writer/director Emerald Fennel thought was a lot less obvious than it actually was.There are several problems here. First, the whole crime part makes no sense - there is no way no one these weird consecutive deaths wouldn't raise suspicions, no way Farleigh or the weird butler wouldn't at some point lay the sequence of events out to the police. It's ludicrous.The crime section of the movie also drags things out much too long. There is a creepy scene in a graveyard that feels like the emotional endpoint of the film, and while stopping there would have left a lot of questions unresolved, it still *felt* like an endpoint. So everything after that feels like a really, really long coda. And this coda seems to move in slow motion, as though the director really hated to let go of the movie.If the graveyard scene had ended the film, people would have wonder what happened after that, but this would have been far better than seeing what happened after that and thinking - Jesus, that was stupid. If you wanted to fill out the end, you could have had a quick series of newspaper clippings showing more death and Oliver's inheritance, and while it would still seem unlikely, at least it would be so quick we could see it more as a toss-off joke.Fennel did a really good job with Promising Young Woman, which was dark but was *coherently* dark and had some depth. Perhaps since the main character was misunderstood, she decided this time around she would explain *everything* in great *detail* at the end, telling you everything that happened and how everyone really felt about everyone else, so that this time there would be no false assumptions.Hopefully she does not do that again.This movie, in spite of being genuinely entertaining and engrossing in parts, stumbles so badly at the end that it takes the whole movie down with it. So I don't recommend it, although it really does have good stuff in it. 0.050836680053547544\n",

Saltburn also has lots of easter eggs so for the viewers who enjoy paying extra close attention this movie will keep you entertained throughout.I've given the movie an 8/10 because I do think it's worth watching.

I don't want to reiterate what everyone else is saying, but like yeah it was freaky. When it wasn't freaky it was just boring. It's like they wanted a bunch of artsy shots and got them before they came up with the plot. Like yeah it was beautiful, but the first half is just a montage of boring stuff.

These scenes are hard to put into words.

These protagonists were a brilliant choice. 10/10 for this aspect of the movie.Now, when I read these negative reviews, such as \"The ending doesn't work.\" and \"it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief\" and whatever....Look, I'm also a critical person, perhaps even too much so. But one thing is crystal clear: One can't criticise a fraud for hiding his true intentions. The better a scammer - or whatever you want to call the protagonist - the less his appearance would be like a scammer. Isn't that right?If a scammer did a good \"job\", you will be shocked.

      "After all I had seen about how \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" Saltburn was, I knew I just had to watch it. I was a little disappointed since I had realized it was over 2 hours long and I don't usually like long movies. I just decided to watch it since everyone I knew that had seen it loved it. My expectations lived up to what everyone had been saying, except that I don't think it's as gross and disturbing as everyone had said it was. I thought Barry Keoghan played Oliver perfectly. I had seen him in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, so I knew that I would love his performance in Saltburn. Weirdly enough, I enjoyed a lot of the scenes people found \"nasty\" or \"too weird\". These scenes made the movie unique in my opinion, and it definitely set it apart from other films. I was getting a bit bored at the beginning because I like movies to pick up instantly. (my expectations of this are lower now since this rarely happens in any critically acclaimed movie of any kind) However, once more and more started happening, I quickly regained my interest. I also thought the ending brought the whole film together, I was worried they weren't going to reveal the cause of Felix's death, or anybody's for that matter. I found the ending very interesting because it amplified my whole experience watching this movie. As I was pondering upon the movie, I saw the final scene and started laughing out loud at 1:00am. It was truly an amazing experience that will probably never repeat with another movie, because this is the first film I've seen to have a character lick one's bath water and dance in the nude to Murder on the Dancefloor in the house of his friend and his friend's family, who he also happened to kill. Although I must warn you if you're going to watch this movie; it really gets Murder on the Dancefloor stuck in your head afterwards, you probably won't stop singing it. 0.0598809523809524\n",

But still I can't get over how weird it is. The cast was very well chosen and clearly very very talented, even though I hated the characters I still liked how almost realistic they were.

The middle of the movie was fun and the climax. However, the ending was the mind TWISTING part. The explanation of what happened was so interesting and enjoyable. Not that people can't express themselves but this movie just topped all barriers for freaky stuff.

      "Movie critic Rex Reed calls \"Saltburn\" a film of staggering impact. I would agree, except he meant it in a positive vein, and I see it as just the opposite. It was decadent, disturbing, disgusting, demented, depraved and dysfunctional. I don't think there are enough d's in the dictionary to fully describe my reaction to it. There are two scenes in particular that challenge the viewer not to gag on the spot, and without describing them, I think you'll easily figure them out if you watch the picture. That's not to say you should watch the picture; I didn't find it to have any redeeming entertainment value. Principal actor Barry Keoghan does deliver a masterful performance, one however that demonstrates he's either very brave or bordering on the edge of mental illness. I'm sure that last comment isn't very fair to the guy, but seriously, the story here is sensationalism disguised as a movie, with scenes that shock one into revulsion. Except for elitist movie critics of course, who will find it praiseworthy beyond words. Proceed at your own risk. 0.21274621212121214\n",
      "I am writing this review nearly immediately after watching Saltburn, so it's hard to fully put into words the cacophony of emotions that I am feeling right now. I am shocked. I am in absolute awe. This surpassed any expectation I had developed, and I went into this with high expectations. Saltburn is the second full-length film from Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennel; the two movies couldn't be more different. This surpasses Promising Young Woman in essentially every way. Saltburn is nothing short of a masterpiece.Saltburn follows Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) a shy yet intelligent student attending Oxford university. When he meets popular, eccentric, and incredibly wealthy Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), they instantly become very close friends. However, when a personal tragedy strikes Oliver, Felix decides to invite Oliver to join him at his summer estate, Saltburn. I'm going to stop myself here, because I feel like by spoiling the movie any further, I would be doing a great injustice.The movie is visually spectacular, and could arguably be one of the, if not the single most visually pleasing movies ever. Every shot is a work of art, both pushing stylistic limitations, and being heavily reminiscent of classic Kubrickian cinematography. The visual storytelling is astonishing, capable of portraying emotions and character arcs seamlessly, while also not being overly self-indulgent in the heavy symbolism. That isn't to say that symbolism isn't heavily present throughout the film, because it very much is. However, despite what at first might seem to be a rather surface level satire of wealth and power, there is a far deeper layer that portrays ambition, love, and the human condition flawlessly. But, back to cinematography. Ignoring symbolism and visual storytelling (which, again, is hard to do), every frame is perfection. One shot in particular, which features the main character standing in front of a rose bush outside a window smoking a cigarette may very well be the most gorgeous shot of all time.Overall, Saltburn is one of the most ambitious, uncomfortable, horrific, shocking, weird, funny, tragic, and fresh movies ever. I absolutely loved it. 98/100. Also, content warning. WTF was the bathtub scene. 0.11071073205401562\n",

The lengths at which Oliver Quick devours the Catton family were... ahem... creative. Oliver Quick felt like a younger, working-class version of Patrick Bateman, and while we are on the subject, I can easily see Saltburn getting the same cult-classic following as American Psycho. But I was frustrated by how unfocused the film was on its ideas. Is this a critique of the billionaire class or people who idolize billionaires? Are people who want to leach off of their wealthy connections good or bad? A social satire like this can be delicious, but we need to know what exactly is being targeted.

It wasn't always easy, but it was exciting, shocking, a little twisted, uh yeah, and quite beautiful. Surprising yet at times it was boring like the lives on screen. Beautiful people, surrounded by beautiful things, and yet ugliness was always there. The actors were perfect. Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan especially convincing, great performances.

I mean, characters were alright, the aesthetic of the film good, but in my opinion, plot was messy and all over the place. I've seen much better movies with the similar plot, which were much more absorbing and interesting to watch. The cast was amazing, so something more could've been done. From peoples reactions, I was excpecting it to be the best movies of 2023, with its amazing plot twists and acting. I mean acting was great of course, but something is still missing.

      "Cavesco - the scene of the blood and blood vessels in the bag - long scenes designed to disturb the dreams of teenagers with close-ups and sweat on the bodies... how boring. The protagonist with an idiotic face like few others is passed off as an evil genius and after half an hour the whole plot is revealed. A film for kids, a little cringe and decidedly overrated.No one notices anything, the protagonist lies and there are plot holes like tunnels but despite everything we have to believe that he is not a loser but a great evil genius.

I'd heard mixed reviews beforehand, especially about it being a highly derivative film, and I've previously disliked Barry Keoghan when I've seen him in movies. However, I can report that I was blown away by this glorious slow-burning thriller and that Keoghan in particular wowed me in a way I haven't been wowed in a long time. It starts off deceptively simple, depicting life at Oxford in a realistic and engrossing way, before moving to a country house where the story gets really interesting.

The only time I was so much disgusted again in a (I don't watch horror regularly) movie is in Hannibal where Hopkins fried Ray Liotta's brain and gave him a bite.Anyway, the young actors were a pleasure to watch, the scenery was ideal, the characters multidimensional, and overall this is a movie to remember days after watching.

The makers of this film hoped a combination of an all-star cast, over-acting, quirky set/costume designs, and 'shock factor' would compensate for their lazy, unoriginal writing...and failed.The pacing was horrible. The first half hour which introduced the characters and set up the story was fine, and then it went downhill from there. The next 1 hr 15 minute were so boring I turned it off without the intention to resume. I only finished it because I heard what happened next from a friend, and decided to see it through.I think at various points in the movie the writers thought \"huh, it's getting a little slow here. What's the most f-ed up thing we can make the main character do?\" Newsflash: humping a grave isn't \"deep\", it's just weird and it makes no sense.I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first ever completely AI-generated script. When Ollie and Venetia kiss when she's scolding him for barely knowing Felix? How does that make any sense? Do people think before they write?And the \"twist\" at the end was so lazy. \"Oh look, he intended on doing this all along.\" Twists are supposed to surprise the viewer. After Oillie clearly killed Felix, it was not at all hard to believe he had bad intentions from the start.Your annoying cinephile friends are going to find some reason to love this movie anyways.

      "Saltburn didn't re-invent the wheel but this is a common theme across cult classics like The Heathers, Jennifer's Body, The Warriors, Scream Queens, and Scarface. We can see what is coming to an extent regarding the plot but as whole the film really is incredible and the shock factor keeps it feeling fresh.The visuals are perfection in my option. Taking a typical gothic, aristocratic, historic setting and inserting modern life is a beautiful blend. From uni students reading Harry Potter over the summer in a Manor House, the accurate amount of smoking young people done in 2006, to the fashion (Zara have just brought in knitted mens polos that are exactly like the ones worn).Barry Keoghan is one of the greats of our generation and I honestly don't think anyone else could have done this role justice, he truly committed which raised the role to the cult level. A true powerhouse when on screen and in previous roles his co-leads have fallen short when in scenes with him but thankfully this didn't happen in Saltburn. Everyone holds their own, Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan have the start of the same on screen unspoken rapport as De Niro and Pacino, hopefully when we look back in 40 years this has developed.This film although predictable in the sense of more murder is coming is still worth multiple watches due to the intensity the actors bring to some of the shock scenes which leaves a deep impression only cult classics do. Your mind wonders back to specific scenes days later as your brain still tries to comprehend them making you want to watch again. 0.14970238095238098\n",

SALT-BURN confirms that inherited wealth produces some of the worse threats to Society, as generations of profiteering on the misery of their Fellow Man leaves the hopelessly harmful heirs as incorrigible cesspools of imbecility, incapable of being a positive influence for the Greater Good.

Still entertaining and the acting was good especially the principal characters. Not sure why they even bothered casting Cary Mulligan. She was in it for a blink.

The development or should I say revealment of Olivers character I believe accurately depicts those in this world, which scarely there are quite a few, that hold his mindset and presents what lengths they would go to which we were shown in the end to get what they want it's truly horrifying.

While viewing the movie, one cannot help but observe the parallels with Patricia Highsmith's \"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\" However, it seems that they are unrelated. Director Emerald Fennell revisits themes explored in her earlier work, \"Promising Young Woman,\" touching on subjects like obsession, privilege, and the extremes people will reach in their pursuit of justice or the fulfillment of their desires. Fennell fell short of expectations in this movie, crafting a poor, weak, implausible script with banal dialogue.Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick stands out as the main highlight of this movie, marking a significant breakthrough in his career.

It is very particular in that the whole story, built up tension, goose-bumpey gruesome moments, surprising twists and (seemingly) complex lead character are destroyed within seconds at the end. With the explanation of the story that the film's ending offers, any need to tell the story in the first place falls away. If its main character is a sociopath then as a viewer you can just throw all the thoughts you had while watching, on his motivation or trauma, out the window. This made me a bit aggressive in the end. Nevertheless the film entertained me well throughout most of it. Also, I am not sure how versatile Barry Keoghan is as an actor but the role he plays here, he plays very well.

Shame, with more sublety was promising and worked like a decent enough horror / class commentary film. Not a film you are likely to forget, just not for all the right reasons. Weak female and secondary characters didn't help, although the main character is pretty androgynous.

However, 'Quick' aside, it is a very stylish and creative film, if not full of some rather vulgar and visceral scenes. The plot and ending were not as some have said, 'surprising'.

      "It's hard not to think of \"Brideshead Revisited\": the \"common\" student who's invited by his rich college friend to stay on their grandiose family castle. But here things take a very different and sinister turn: Oliver, the inconspicuous guest, triggered by an obsessive but unrequited love for his handsome friend Felix, gradually weaves a machiavellistic web of lies and insinuations in which not only his friend, but the whole family gets (fatally) entangled. The movie is for the major part a real slow burner, carefully building up the suspense towards a dramatic climax, after which the pace changes to a cascade of cautiously orchestrated, almost understated violence.The settings in a Downton Abbey-like castle and gardens are breathtaking, the cinematography is impressive, the dialogues are great (and at times hilarious, as with mother Elspeth and her guests!), and there's a brooding and sensuous atmosphere. But it's especially the acting that stands out: Rosamund Pike does a great job as mother Elspeth, and Jacob Elordi proves that he is not just a gorgeous face and body, he totally stands his own as the spoilt and blasé, but well-meaning Felix. The pivot of the movie however is Barry Keoghan, he is absolutely excellent as either the obsessed but forlorn lover-from-afar, as well as the scheming and sly avenger. Maybe Keoghan should be aware not to be too much typecasted in this kind of weird roles, but oh boy, how well does he do it!Are there no flaws? Yes, if you like to nitpick. In the last say twenty minutes the dramatic and spectacular turns rather tumble over each other, which made it feel a bit rushed. As did the epilogue in which Oliver reveals his actions, it was too explanatory for my taste, I had liked it better to draw my own conclusions. At one time there was mention of a police investigation, but this dead-ended; in view of the following casualties it's hard to believe that they didn't take it further and at least put Oliver to the test. But these few reservations didn't weigh up to all the wonderful and impressive rest. And the closing scene of Oliver dancing shamelessly through the rooms of the castle was absolutely priceless! 0.2308333333333333\n",
      "\"Saltburn\" can be summed up in a single word: \"pretentious.\" The film constantly positions itself as a great work but is nothing more than another movie made for the Oscars that didn't achieve the expected success. However, despite its arrogance, the film has some positive elements, such as its cold and bluish cinematography and excellent framing. The performances of Barry Keoghan and Rosamund Pike are great. At a certain point, the movie reminded me of \"Parasite,\" but much dirtier and more sadistic, which makes me like it a bit for not being afraid of madness. However, at times, I feel it loses its way, affecting the narrative coherence. I don't like its conclusion or its plot; the strengths lie more in the artistic aspect than in the script of a film that has some good aspects but, overall, is a highly pretentious and empty feature. 0.1610201392810089\n",

This would be the only movie with nudity in my top ten(I don't enjoy shock for shocks sake unless it's a horror movie). This movie felt to me like it was going to be a coming of age story.

I like a good scene of intimacy but these were just in bad \"taste\". This was the first time I saw Barry Keough in a film and I could keep my eyes off of him.

      "Overall, this is a really enjoyable film. The settings are incredible. The cast is amazing. The plot really draws you in and has a wonderful menace about it the whole time. However, I do think the ending was just a little over the top to remain credible.The Kira Knightly movie of Pride & Prejudice had to be given an 'American' alternative ending. Cabin At The End of the World, which has the most wonderfully enigmatic ending in the book, is totally rewritten for the movie, and presumably for American audiences. The ambiguity of Saltburn throughout is its great charm, and yet in the last minute we have stuff we suspected and feared laid out for us. The mystique was lost. How much more subtle it would have been to have Oliver enigmatically mention to someone that he was rather good with bicycles, or that, indeed, being able to make yourself sick was a very useful trick...\n",

      "A talented cast including Richard E. Grant, Rosamund Pike, and Carey Mulligan was wasted on a terrible script with clunky dialogue and a half-baked meandering plot that runs out of steam in the third act. Anyone who has seen \"The Talented Mr. Ripely\" will guess that Oliver will ingratiate himself with Felix, become obsessed with him, do something that weirds him out, and kill him, all in the first 5 minutes of the film. As soon as you see Oliver looking at the hedge maze you know that's where he will kill Felix. As soon as Felix tells Oliver he has a \"surprise\" for his birthday, a \"road trip\", you know he's going to take him to see his mother, you know she'll turn out to be perfectly nice and not an addict, and that Dad's actually alive and a responsible citizen, too. And once Venetia starts calling Oliver out after Felix's funeral, you know she's going to die. Then the supposed \"twist\" at the end is so clumsily set up that it makes M Night Shyamalan's forced, formulaic plot twists look like freaking Hitchcock. It's incredibly unbelievable. Oliver saw Felix at Oxford, just knew if he punctured Felix's bicycle tire and then lent him his while pretending to be poor and awkward and pitiable, Felix would take him under his wing, invite him to his country manor house so Oliver could manipulate the foilbles he just knew Felix's gentry family would have, kill them off one by one until he could manipulate the bereaved matriarch into signing over the whole estate to him, which was as legally implausible as it was logically implausible (good thing for Ollie wealthy titled socially connected families never have cadet branches that might have something to say about some nobody popping up and having control of the estate signed over to him after three closely timed untimely deaths).And just as there is no rhyme or reason why even the most brilliant mastermind should think that such a far fetched plan that involves passively hoping multiple variables outside his control come to pass, there is also no plausible explanation given for why Oliver should choose to target this family. He supposedly loved Felix until Felix got creeped out by his lies (back to the Talented Mr Ripley rehash), but even before his lies about his parents were discovered, he was screwing Venetia and the Farleigh for reasons that don't seem to serve his machinations or plot or character development and would threaten his chances with Felix. Then it is he hated Felix, the one guy at Oxford who was kind and accepting of him unconditionally. Some class warfare motivation is implied, the poor kid (checks notes) scratch that, comfortably middle class kid envíes rich kid (yawn). And then there is the implication maybe Oliver did all this just because he's a sociopath, which is a lazy cop out. It's like in a bizarre case of alternative pleading as plot development, director/screenwriter Fannell is throwing character motivation options against the wall like so much undercooked pasta to see what sticks.And Oliver is not the only character who is poorly fleshed out. The Farleigh character is well acted and succeeds in making the audience hate him, but Oliver is so over the top creepy and cringy that Farleigh's douchebaggery towards him does practically nothing to build audience empathy for Oliver. And the way Oliver is able to get Farleigh disowned so easily by revealing his coke use is as anticlimactic as it is unbelievable. Carey Mulligan's character is so one dimensional, and barely there before she's unceremoniously killed offscreen with no impact on the characters or the audience that you wonder why Fannell bothered to cast a name actor like Mulligan in the role at all. Richard E Grant is the slightly dotty hereditary member of the leisure class, a tired stock character, as is Rosamund Pike's facilely effusive but actually flinty upper class British woman character, as is Venetia's poor little rich girl/wild child.A a psychological thriller this movie is a failure. As a social satire this movie is a failure. As an absurdist black comedy this movie is a failure. It only serves to make the audience uncomfortable for 2 hours while failing to deliver a payoff in either humor or smart ploy list or incisive commentary that would make that discomfort worth it in the end. 0.0241921768707483\n",
      "7.5/10For me the lesson of this entire movie was that although our messy ass main character ends up with everything...he truly still has nothing and is still alone. He has no friends, he shunned his family, he has no Felix to obsess over anymore. He just has himself in this empty mansion???He was so desperate to be Felix but he can never be Felix because everybody freaking loved Felix???? So he will always be a sad and miserable little parasite.At first after watching I was highly disturbed and wasn't sure I liked the movie. I thought to myself \"what is the lesson, what is the moral, what is the theme, what is the point??\" But the more I thought on it...the more I appreciated the way everything came together.I read a few reviews and personally I feel like it's one of those hate it or love it movies. 0.023293650793650787\n",
      "The sickly obsession and need for manipulation of a gifted boy, all transferred to the darling of a university population, the handsome, tender and surprisingly accessible Felix. Felix is a fairly clichéd character, but the mystery surrounding his personality for at least half the film felt very real to me. The direction questions quite well - at least it did for me - the transparency of Felix's personality and emotions and, by turns, those of his family members. The initial vagueness is - it seems to me - successful. Felix willingly and without limit offers his light to Oliver, who, in appearance and personality, is unattractive. There's nothing really special about him. So, is Felix's approach sincere? The doubt lingers almost brilliantly, I think.For me, we're a little too taken aback by Oliver, and in the end we don't get to know him any more than that in the course of the film. It's clear enough that this is a writing and directing choice, but I'm not convinced. Are we satisfied with the depth given to this background given the rest (we're not clobbered with substance either), and after having glimpsed his parents and not really understood where this behavior comes from? I don't think this choice was a bias towards the innate, but rather the freedom to plan for doubts. In the end, Felix offered his light to Oliver's shadow, which was too powerful and would eventually consume him. No moral (or it escapes me). But then certain aspects bother me. Is Elspeth's naiveté realistic? And the butler, what's his role in the end? What's there to remember (if anything)?Finally, about the \"lifting of the curtains\" on Oliver. The transition seemed far too obvious (especially when the scene with Oliver's parents arrive), and for me this is Saltburn's worst and most obvious weakness. Everything becomes far too predictable. We understand long before the denouement that Oliver is behind all the mischief, and we wait for the scenes to come, hoping that the denouement will outdo us yet again. But it doesn't, and the attempt at a final plot twist strikes me as extremely clumsy. We now know how Oliver did it, and our curiosity (if any) is satisfied, but the final scenes are bland. Too bad.Of course above's a focus of what disturbed me the most, but I would qualify Saltburn as a good movie overall, benefiting from great actings and very good visuals, with some memorables scenes, and in which we don't get quite bored. Perhaps not original and disturbing enough to qualify as excellent. 0.1446384479717813\n",
      "Pretty entertaining.I felt held in suspense most of the way through, unsure who was really the psychopath (Quick or the Felix family) - though the final resolution is actually a bit predictable. I think it needed a good twist - which it didn't have.The disturbing moments (bath scene) added to the sense of the uncanny and the undertone of something sinister.The central theme of wanting so much to be another; the desire to become them; to climb inside them is interesting - but not original, and possibly done better in The Talented Mr Ripley. The more limited charm of Oliver Quick (vs Matt Damon) also makes the story somewhat less credible - why does Felix abide by him? Is it just naive kindness? I think his motivations could have been more thought through.The film also attempts some sort of social critique. For example, the maze scene is packed with symbolism: Oliver (the harmless deer - exploitation and sport for the rich) vanquishes Felix (Icarus - the rich fly too high, they are due a great fall), reversing the social order and expectations. Though this aspect of the film is not particularly strong.Some of the scenes are fun (final naked dance) and the music is full of contemporary pop which situates it and evokes the period well. 0.19935328185328186\n",
      "I went into this movie thinking it would be shocking and provocative and while it was, it was to the extent people where saying. It was highly reserved in female nudity which I appreciate and had mild but gross out sexual driven scenes. I loved mostly every second of this film and with it being nothing like promising young woman I am ready to see what the director gives us next. I see that some people say the ending is spoon fed to us but I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed so I think her for that. The ending really solidified this movie for me so I'm not sure why people saying it ruined it.

      "I had to sleep on this before figuring out if I like it or not - it was certainly weird and I find it far fetched to think that a wealthy family would so easily invite a stranger into their house but then that young black guy was also a strangler. It's supposed to be a comedy but I found the dark humor disturbing with all the in your face moments with Ollie. The family kind of reminded me of the Royal Tanenbaums with their eccentric lifestyle. I am not a fan of Keough but he did make an excellent liar and creep with a big dick and the sex on into grave sight was a bit much. The estate was great as was the scenery, set designs and costumes.

The plot was predictable, instead of filling it with disgusting vomit of the shock elements, they could've built the characters, added some coherence to the story. It has more than a few dark, disturbing, nausea-inducing scenes and it's pathetic unless there's some explaining done from the characters pov on why it's required in the plot.I see a lot of praise in the comments and I don't understand it, I don't understand the significance of putting Oxford in the description either.

      "Honestly I was totally enchanted by this film... especially the dynamic between Ollie and Felix. It seems like quite a bromance until the end explains all... as much as it might seem one way... Oliver loves Felix. I was captivated enough by shots of Ollie's behind, captivated by a certain bathtub scene, a certain funerary display... but was floored when he dances naked in the end. I was not expecting that at all... I almost thought I willed it to happen, I almost felt seduced by Ollie myself... the actor Barry Keoghan is absolutely beautiful. More so I'm glad directors are starting to realize what an untapped frontier the male nude is. It is far too one sided in cinema. Is it really so necessary to expose women but never men? Obviously women aren't always nude in context... I'm glad this film wasn't scared to go in these directions. SO many Agatha Christie mysteries have a twist like this story... bravo. 0.18892857142857145\n",

Some of happenings are illogical in today's criminal science advancement or even ten, fifteen years ago when this film is set. The dancing at the end is hilarious though. Is this a fun watch? That depends on your tolerance of dark humour. And many actor like Richard E.

During its unnecessarily long showing I fondled my remote-control numerous times but in the end decided to see where the heck it's going and begrudgingly managed to sit through it. I shouldn't have. In my opinion it is derivative and nonsensical art-for-the-sake-of-art drivel all the way around from the senseless twaddle that's supposed to serve as dialog to gratuitous, shock and awe sex scenes which do not drive or add to the plot. And speaking of the plot, there isn't any. Someone here said that the third act requires a huge suspension of disbelief but that was too kindly put. The main protagonist gets poisoned and there is no police investigation although he is obviously poisoned? The \"parents\" are more concerned about the lunch than the death of their son? Everything that went on was premeditated? Really? The truth is that the movie was going nowhere and with over 2 hours of running time they had to wrap it up somehow. And they did, very poorly.

      "Fennell's previous film, \"Promising Young Woman,\" was a hate fantasy about wreaking vengeance on a bunch of abusive guys (and one woman administrator) responsible for the death of the heroine's friend. As happens in such fantasies (and ONLY in such fantasies), every step of her plan went way too smoothly; the avenging heroine easily tricked all the men -- reducing them, one by one, to contrite weeping wimps -- and humiliated the woman administrator, leaving her crushed.The hate fantasy in this new film succeeds with even more implausible ease. A homely, inarticulate, lumpish nerd at Oxford is -- implausibly -- befriended by a tall, handsome, immensely wealthy fellow student who takes him home to his lavish, implausibly underpopulated country estate the size of Buckingham Palace, where his aristocrat family lives with what appears to be a single butler and two footmen (except at one point near the end, where a gaggle of servants we've never seen before suddenly appear). This family -- implausibly sappy, since the success of the comic-book plot depends on their being a bunch of absolute patsies -- takes the lumpish young visitor to its bosom, lavishing upon him a totally unbelievable degree of attention and affection.... whereupon, halfway through the movie, the inarticulate young visitor is suddenly revealed to be a smooth-talking, Machiavellian, diabolical psychopath who neatly -- did I mention implausibly? -- murders the family members, one by one, and in the end inherits the estate.So basically, the movie starts out as \"Brideshead Revisited,\" only cruder and ickier, and midway through turns into \"The Omen,\" only dumber.There's one original surprise involving the young man's return home. I didn't even recognize the wonderful actress Dorothy Atkinson as his mother. And Archie Madekwe is all too believable as the sort of arrogant, racially privileged type we don't often see depicted in today's media. 0.12595762823035553\n",

Anyone saying it's a copy or derivative doesn't know anything about the film industry. I went into the film with a strong idea of the plot from the trailers however this film blew my ideas out of the water. The ending is guessable because you knew a twist was coming but the very strong script keeps you invested in the film.

Barry Keoghan and Rosamund Pike (Played Elspeth Catton) were both amazing in this film, they really stood out to me, along with Alison Oliver (Played Venetia Catton). The story intrigued me and kept me watching. Overall, I really enjoyed the film and left me with questions however, in a good way. There were some sexual scenes however, they fitted and weren't just for the sake of it and its aesthetic to fit with the film. Loved the psychological aspect. 0.3661538461538462\n",

      "I heard everyone talking about this so I just finished watching it so I'm going to just free form write my thoughts about it and that's it. Visually this movie is great. It really had some stunning scenes. Rosamund Pike is awesome. I knew when I heard she was is it, I said she had to be the rich mother. She's so believable in her role. The whole family of Felix's is weird, but the weirdest one is still Oliver played by Barry Keoghan. It reminded me of Talented Mr Ripley, but also New Best Friend with Mia Kirshner.If you ever saw that, it's very similar only with young women. Oliver really wanted Felix's life not Felix, that was the motivation and that is believable, not that he would do all this out of some obsession for Felix. One of the main reasons, the only reason really I didn't give this an 8 or 9 are the 3 gross scenes. The one with Vanetia, the one with Farleigh and the one on the grave. All those were disgusting and I don't think necessary, but I've noticed that movies are pushing perversion more and more and it's not good. When I was growing up, all the movies about young people I watched and none of them had sick crap like this in them. They could have done less or inferred things and the movie would be something I would recommend and rewatch even. This is the kind of movie my mother would like but I can't recommend it to her because she would hate those scenes. So I'm just putting my opinion out there incase future filmakers read reviews. It is not necessary to write sick stuff and make your actors do all kinds of nastiness to sell films. It reminded me of how Tom Holland had to take a vacation after that show had him make out with a man and he's not gay. I sometimes think these filmmakers are sexual deviants and do this just to get the actors to do what they want. Hate to think it but like I said, none of that was necessary. Also did anyone notice the giant Baphomet statue in the maze or whatever that was? A black devil goat holding a pig. Now why would a rich family have that? Just why? I can understand why people get ideas that Hollywood is throwing satanic symbolism in our faces. I know the Catton's were supposed to be eccentric but that is over the top. And again it seems they're relying too much on shock value. None of this is necessary when your script is good and you have the talent.Anyway, ultimately I enjoyed it despite my criticism, Barry Keoghan is a great actor, a natural. Last scene was a nice touch. Watching him emote all the different emotions throughout, he's really going to go far in his career. . Just a warning though: don't watch with your parents or kids or neighbors or any extended family. 0.12558557513914656\n",
      "Saltburn was a huge dissapointment especially since I have seen such high praise for it. The film is dark, indie like, and doesn't really have much to say. Yes, there are some shocking scenes here and strong performances throughout but I had to ask myself at the end what did I just watch. What does it all mean?! I really feel like I wasted over 2 hours of my time here with this movie. Now I know a lot of people will probably argue that I wasn't really getting the meaning behind this film and trust me I get it. I just feel like this could have been created better.

Like I thought 56 minutes in was going to be the weirdest part, ummm no I was wrong, at one hour 45 minutes in, yeah I'm gonna say that part takes the cake! Then the following scene, Alison Carver(Venetia) was amazing!! She did a fabulous job. Truthfully one of the reasons I didn't like this more was Barry Keoghan(Oliver) for me he just wasn't charming enough for his role. I don't know, just something never clicked with me. He just couldn't pull off the savviness his character should've had. Then we have the finale, the last few minutes actually changed how I felt. Great ending, they left nothing to the imagination.

I kept thinking about some of the lines way after I watched it and urged my missus to give it a try, suffice to say she loved it too.

Okay enough I guess. It was really the writing/directing and cinematography that carried this movie. It's just frustrating because I feel like Barry isnt a believable bad guy, that's why he plays a timid loner throughout most of the movie. And I feel like Hollywood just gave him this super messed up role so that we associate it with the joker character he's going to play in the next B@man movie.

It is excellent - one of those rare films you see that makes you think at the end 'f me that was great'. Without spoilers, Barry Keoghan is such a perfect fit for the character. Most actors (particularly the really big Hollywood names) are doing the job without any special qualities or skill, but just happen to look 'good'. BK knocks them into mediocrity. The supporting cast are good; a special mention for Rosamund Pike who plays her character deliciously. The film keeps you guessing as to what it's all about, but in an intriguing and entertaining way. All is explained at the end with a delicious reveal.

It is at once essentially unoriginal, and with an obscured and confusing storyline that leaves holes where a cracking narrative should have been.Weird plot jumps and cinematic padding elongated an already sparse storyline, not helped, either, by irritating plot twists, made so by jolting screenplay holes, that begged explanation, or the dramatic hinting of other rational realisations and character interlocutors.The miscasting of the lead is a frustrating mistake the casting director should have been fired for; in this role Keoghan was not meant to be, despite his considerable talent. His portrayal seems to leak his own difficulty in portraying such a monstrous, conniving, psychopathic killer with ideas of predatorily seeking unattainable sex and his gaining of power and riches.The movie,which was far too long, confusing, dramatically ineffective, and generally unbelievable; even the ending of a naked Keoghan dancing through, now, 'his' property, was jarring and inexplicable. A hairy ass crack is not a good denouement; a bizarre irrelevance.Finally, the other big issue with this movie, is that there was not one single sympathetic character; they were all vacuous, facile, fanciful, stereotypes, or just plain boring individuals barely sketched out, as if through a window obscured by dust and grime.The only real high point, was that of the locations. Oxford and the mythic Saltburn were both stupendously easy on the eye.Recommended with reservations; 4/10. 0.001252976190476185\n",
      "\"Saltburn\" dives into class conflict with a gripping narrative following a group seeking justice against the wealthy elite. Led by Barry Keoghan, Oliver Quick, the film captures the struggle of societal injustice against generational wealth.Director Emerald Fennell crafts a visually immersive experience, but the film's message gets lost in its moral ambiguity. While critiquing inequality, it blurs the lines between condemning the wealthy and glorifying the questionable actions of the protagonists.The ensemble cast delivers compelling performances, yet the screenplay's inconsistency leaves the film's eat-the-rich theme somewhat muddled.

      "Barry Keoghan has done it again. He has this gift to play such weird and twisted characters so effortlessly. Oliver Quick is an incredibly messed up character and Keoghan did him justice.Emerald Fennell has created something truly special. We see this extremely wealthy family allowing Oliver to stay with them for the summer, granted it was Felix who invited Oliver. Throughout Oliver's stay he does so many unimaginable things, some of which are very disturbing.Although many scenes at the surface just make you want to look away, when looking at them on a deeper level, there is so much more being said. For example, the graveyard scene. At a glance it is a very disturbing scene which will make you want to look away from the screen whilst questioning what is going on. When looking at it on a deeper level, Oliver did love Felix up till the point when Felix found out the truth. Oliver had no choice but to kill him. We many times before this scene Oliver spies on Felix as he has sex. Oliver did desire to be intimate with Felix but never got the chance. When Oliver starts to seemingly have sex on top of Felix's grave, it shows how he was so obsessed with Felix. He is a psychopath in love.I do think that the third act of the film could have been done better. It felt sort of rushed and didn't seem to align with whatever that had happened earlier.

It's deeply built into the narrative from the start, and perhaps the disconnect is that you simply have to accept that not everyone thinks or perceives things as you might? The acting and directing are too notch across the board. It's a somewhat familiar story with a bit of a shakeup. However, it's not groundbreaking or completely out there. It's just a very well made and well told story. 0.1527777777777778\n",
      "\"Saltburn\" (12/22/23, 125-min, R, $19M w/w) is an interesting contrast of English gentry and commoners. It follows the summer exploits of commoner \"Oliver Quick\" on scholarship to Oxford and his seemingly chance meeting with \"Felix Catton\" whose aristocratic family resides at the palatial \"Saltburn\" estate. Felix generously invites Ollie to stay with them over the summer but Saltburn's residents and hangers-on ensure Ollie knows his place as a temporary plaything of Felix. However, the film which excels in its cinematography and accompanying grand/epic music - takes an interesting turn when the underestimated Ollie turns the tables on the gentry. This is one of those movies that warranted a full mini-series treatment though because they totally rushed the ending which'll make you feel cheated. Yes, there's a satisfying reveal montage but it's rushed and crammed into the final 15-mins of its runtime. It'd have played out so much better as six 45-min episodes. Tip of the hat to \"newcomer\" Jacob Elordi as \"Felix\" who played his part so convincingly and appears to be the next Hollywood \"it\" guy. 0.28939393939393937\n",
      "Saltburn is a deliciously entertaining and insanely conceived film. All the main cast, especially Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi, are outstanding and perfectly casted. Barry Keoghan is fearless and gave the performance of his career. Jacob Elordi, as photographed by cinematographer Linus Sandgren, has never looked more captivating, and played the role of Felix with effortless ease. Who needs special effects when you have Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan. The film is about desire, and has so many \"oh did they just go there\" moments, is a gorgeous and memorable movie experience.

I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but I was stunned again by the ending. And that's all I'll say. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting was impressive.

The most cliche'd plot, average acting, a lead character who manages to be a cross between the wonderful Stephen Graham and the appalling British politician Michael Portillo, a truly awful waste of a great actor in Carey Mulligan, and about four great lines in an average script. Totally unbelievable characters, shoddy dialogue, and a stupid storyline. Rosamund Pyke had the two best lines in the whole film and was sort of believable.

Barry Keoghan does a great job with the creepy eyes and there's great chemistry with Jacob Elordi.It's the fact that at the end, the underdog becomes obsessed with the lavish lifestyle and popular guy and ends up killing him and becoming him. Whoever who wrote the plot wrote this as fanfiction to the amazing The Talented Mr Ripley and added in all the weird stuff in it as fetish that they wished could go on screen.Watch this only if you like bad plots and masturbing on a grave is required in the film. 0.18928571428571433\n",

      "The overall rating of Saltburn on IMDB is 7.1...that seems slightly more generous than I'd give it, but half points aren't allowed....Scrolling through the numerous reviews on this sight, the reference to \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" the 1999 film starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Cate Blanchette (based on the 1955 novel by the same name), are plentiful...there's a reason for that--if you saw Mr. Ripley, which I did upon its release, the parallels are undeniable: first there's the plot, then there's the hype...both films have been lauded, both films were underwhelming in their own rights...I don't hold Ripley in the esteem that many on here obviously do...it was an Ok film that fell short in my book....but, on to Saltburn....If you've managed to scroll through and read all of the reviews and have, somehow, inexplicably found your way to mine, you know the players, and you know their play, so I'm not going to bore you with a plot recap...we'll go to the pros and cons....Pros: There are some good performances...I guess I was slightly more impressed with Jacob Elordi than many on here...he's beautiful, he plays the role of the privileged and lazy playboy effortlessly, and he has a genuine charm, if not an adolescent temperament...his casting was obvious, because it's not too far fetched to see why people are meant to be drawn to him...the camera loves him, so why shouldn't we? I bought it...Rosamund Pike and Richard E Grant play the British upper class parents who live in an obscene castle, with obscene wealth, and a forced sense of charity with aplomb...Pike especially so--and if there are lines to laugh at, odds are she's the one delivering them (her dalliance in lesbianism comes to mind)...well, maybe not so much a laugh as a chuckle, but there is some humor there...their tone deafness and their being oblivious to the real world is where most of the humor comes from...they ooze fake sentiment...I liked the Farleigh character--the sexually fluid, sinister, dark sheep, party boy...Archie Madekwe fleshes him out, and makes him interesting...he has a few moments before he's cast off, never to be seen again...the visuals are lush, but devoid of actual substance and attachment--which is the mood of the film, so it helps weave the narrative...Cons: ...it's a LONG weave...Saltburn clocks in over the 2 hour mark, but it feels exponentially longer than its actual time...it drags...a lot of the decadence for decadence's sake could've been shaved off...Carey Mulligan is introduced, and has the potential to be the Helena Bonham Carter-esque \"cookiest character\" in the film as \"Poor Dear\" Pamela, but her role boils down to nothing more than a cameo--at most, 10 minutes of the 2 hour plus--so, just when you're wanting to get to know her, she leaves (although, the reaction to her offscreen death is another chuckle)...the \"shock for shock's sake\" scenes didn't disturb me, I just don't like it when I'm spoon fed just how crazy someone is meant to be...did I need to see Oliver suck sperm bathwater, perform oral sex on a menstruating teen and the end results, or take his clothes off in the rain and dry hump a fresh grave to know he was a little off? My first instinct is, no--I don't, but that brings me to the problems I had with Barry Keoghan's Ollie...He's the central character, and I'll say that he shows definite commitment to the role, but the casting is problematic....fine as an actor as he may be, Keoghan showed all 31 of his years when juxtaposed with Elordi, Madekwe, Allison Oliver (who plays Felix's sister, Venetia), and the rest of the clan at Oxford...so much so that when he is aged 16 years at the end of the film, he looks exactly the same age as Rosmund Pike's Elspeth when they have their \"chance meeting\" at the cafe near the film's conclusion...there's nothing particularly attractive about him (except his surprising physique), and he's not terribly endearing, yet everyone wants to take him under their wing and take care of him...if there was any kind of expression to his face that went along with his performance, perhaps it might've been more believable, but as it stands, it's not...there had to have been other options for the role of Oliver, but maybe they couldn't have got the funding for the film without Keoghan--it happens, but who knows?The real con is the plot predictability....the minute Farleigh's email to Sotheby's is revealed, you knew Oliver did it...the minute Felix's body is found in the maze, you knew Oliver did it--so much so that the only shock is that Felix was poisoned...I'd have bet money he'd have been impaled by the antlers that Oliver was wearing at the party the night before...the minute Felix gets in the jeep to take Oliver to see his allegedly widowed mother, you knew it was all a lie...in fact, the only shock at the end, when you find out that Oliver had a hand in every death in the Catton Family--save the father (or, did he?)--the fact that he's talking to a nearly dead Elspeth instead of a detective was the only surprise...it was hardly the \"The Usual Suspects\" revelation that Emerald Fennell was probably intending, and came across as more \"Oh, look how clever I am\"...he deflated the tire on Felix's bike, he had money at the pub, he's typing nonsense on the computer at the cafe, he put razors next to Venetia's tub--I get it--I'm not clutching my pearls...the film ends with Oliver dancing naked around Saltburn...yep, still crazy even with all the goals met, the wealth achieved, and all that's happened...we get it....I didn't hate the film...I didn't love the film...I'm not even sure I \"liked\" it...much like Mr. Ripley 25 years ago, my ending feeling was, \"Meh\".... 0.12046482264505518\n",

More than this movie I have a profound disdain for the Oliver character who had no redeeming qualities and was played in a bland performance by the actors' equivalent of soggy toast.Others in the cast played their parts well.

The attempted 'twist' of Oacar having plotted the takeover of Saltburn didn't feel at all like it fit the story and was maybe thrown in for the sake of having a 'twist'. I'd have preferred the film to end with Oscar being banished by High Society and thrust back into his middle class life. A better twist might have been for him in the future the be desperately trying to befriend other high society families and failing.The dance at the end, of course saves the plot holes and sends viewers away with a smile. 0.12076923076923075\n",

Every single character felt impossible to relate to and were outrageously out of touch with reality (which was obviously the point).

They didn't play upon the setting in a suspenseful way. Was it a poor music background movie? I dunno. After I watched and thought poorly of it at first, then I kept wondering why.It lacked that hold-your-breath moment when you're watching a film with either great story line and/or actors' characters.Barry Keeghan is a wonderful actor and he does so in his part very well. The whole cast was good. I don't think it was poor writing. Even though it was a good story, it lacked that edge of the seat experience. A real shame.

He's got the right look for the character--attractive, but not Elordi-level....that keeps the initial tension firmly in place all the time. *No Spoilers*, just saying that there is more in this than meets the eye.

The art direction of this movie is superb, and so Fennell is quickly establishing herself as a Tarantino-level type director. Kudos on both of those points.

The problem of most films and soap operas is on show here. The wealthy, privileged ones are a parody of real human beings, who feel emotions and have worldly issues to deal with, unlike the self-centred family at the heart of this drama. Of course, if they were more rounded and savvy, the creepy drama would unravel too soon. Even half way through we still identify with the nerdy, emotionless but weirdly primal, erotic and sensual lead, brilliantly acted. Oliver intrajects all the crap and cliches given out surely to humiliate him but there is no reaction.

I think it would've been better if the multiple deaths that occur were scattered throughout the film, rather than them all happening in the last half an hour or so as the film rushes towards a conclusion.

The themes around posh people who come from old money being rude and spoilt, or about how the quest for money and power can corrupt people, are all quite generic and things we've seen a lot in other films before. 0.09916666666666668\n",
      "This story is basically: Mr. Ripley meets Parasite meets Call Me By Your Name. The main character is Oliver, a shy young man that begins a friendship with the coolest guy in his college, Felix, handsome, rich, sociable, lovable. Felix invites him into his home and then a lot of bad things happen as Oliver becomes more and more obsessed with him.Mr. Ripley is the closest comparison. The story of the movie basically follows a nobody and his love/hate towards this perfect guy. This is the second Emerald Fennell movie and... well... overall it's not a step down or a step up from Promising Young Woman. It definitely looks really good, has good pacing and it keeps you entertained. The performances are all good, but the best one is probably Jacob Elordi, who turns his character surprisingly likable. The reason why I don't think Keoghan is the best is because, while he definitely does a lot of different things acting-wise, his character is too indecipherable overall. And that's a problem with the writing.Fennell has a problem with self-indulging in her own coolness and her own ideas, and ultimately tries to pull off a movie that is very undecided in what it wants to be. It's not a homoerotic story all that much, because the homoerotic attraction only exists one way and sometimes doesn't even feel important. It wants to be a super evil noir where the main character does awful things to get what he wants, but his motivations are not well defined, cause it's neither pure love/hate nor desire for money. Oliver is stumbling on his own words to get his story straight in one scene, and in the other he is a calm and collected psycho. The fact that we don't get to see the wheels spinning in the main character's head, that we don't really know him, is the movie's worst flaw. We know he's doing all of these things because it's obvious, but we don't see him arrive at that point psychologically. He just does them off-screen, and at one point I thought there would be a total unresolved ambiguity (did he do it? Did he really do it?), but then the twist reveal at the end basically explains it to death. It was probably one of the worst twist-explanation I've seen. It's completely unnecessary, and the way it happens is so cartoon-villain-y for no reason. And the ending scene - well, there was a lot to see, I can't complain - but it's also a really strange scene that really clashes with the tone and flattens everything. So what I'm saying is that Emerald Fennell needs to write better characters, and MOST IMPORTANTLY better endings. 0.1357010582010582\n",
      "I should preface this by saying I was very impressed by Fennel's A Promising Young Woman. I think any exploration of sex, gender, and class has merit. Saltburn started well and lured me into the story, but as soon as it switched over to the manor house, it lost me. Not clever enough to be satire and not frightening enough to be a thriller, what was it? And what was the point of showing Oliver's character going home to a seemingly happy and financially comfortable family? I found the contrast of that background with the very wealthy family almost offensive, particularly from a director coming from great privilege herself. And what was the point of Oliver's supposed interest in Felix? As a gay man, I found it a bit \"gay-baity\". And then it all seemed like it ran out of time and rushed the story after the climactic birthday party. And that ending? Really? BK has proven himself an excellent actor, but really? The story might have been better served by a \"fleshed out\" short series. Pretentious and ultimately pointless. 0.30250000000000005\n",
      "By chance, a free afternoon and so I went to see 'Saltburn' only having seen the trailer. How pleased I was! So much work has gone into this production that it's hard to point at the best elements. If I had to pick it would be the scriptwriting accompanied with the punchy editing that had me laughing out loud. The acting is bang on. Jacob Elordi's portrayal of an aristocratic university student was so real that I'm amazed to read he is Australian. Rosamund Pike's character was amusing, but Rosamund didn't quite cut the age of a matriarch. The locations were blinding. The lighting all throughout was well crafted. I enjoyed the the storyline and the shocking quirkiness of the personalities especially the principal character. 0.16666666666666669\n",

No one I've talked to that said they liked the movie can actually articulate why they like it.

Then came the infamous bathtub drain scene. I feel nauseous just thinking about it.Honestly not sure I'd recommend this movie to anyone I know. Although I loved each and everyone one of the actors and even fell in love with \"Felix\" myself, I just can't shake this feeling of wishing I'd never seen this film in the first place. That's how mean and ugly and awful it felt/still feels to me. I guess that's what it was meant to do? To mess with our heads?That one person could wreak so much havoc and get away with it is distressing.

When the credits were running, I couldn't help wondering where \"Duncan,\" the butler got to . . . He didn't protect his employers after all his many years in their service? He didn't suspect or care to save poor \"Elspeth\" from her horrific demise?

      "I like films that do not easily conform to a particular genre, and this is definitely one of those. It starts with the hallmarks of an Evelyn Waugh portrayal of Oxford University, in its portrayal of the clash between wealth and privilege on one side and poor but bright scholarship students on the other, before morphing in a more sinister direction. Then it gets quite scary as the scene shifts to the inevitable stately home (not a million miles from the one in Brideshead Revisited), as a poor disadvantaged student grapples with the eccentricities of a very wealthy family. Then, it changes direction yet again, and things we thought were true are demonstrated to be fabrications. All of that I got. The real problem I have with this film is its strange take on sexuality. It just did not seem to get it right somehow, and seemed to me to be deliberately sexually provocative for no good reason, whilst not integrating the sexual dimensions into the narrative effectively.

      "Fennel did wonders with \"Saltburn\". I'm really confused and I do not really know what I am supposed to feel. Usually in movies you root for the underdog but this time I really did struggle with that. Keoghan is such a powerful actor, with such a rich performance in this movie. His character is such a very difficult person to read yet he makes absolute sense. You feel sorry for him yet there's still something there lingering beneath the surface. I really don't know how else to describe it. You see the longing for Elordi's character yet you really can't explain it fully. Then there's great performances around the cast, all making the characters really easy to hate. There's a story in \"Saltburn\" that is told plainly and then there's layers of storytelling underneath that, and so many shocking moments. The cinematography is the reason to watch and enjoy this movie, every frame feels like a living picture. The scenery and the setting is so lush and beautiful, everything is so well thought and so well plotted.

The 4:3 aspect ratio tries to give the impression of a serious movie but it´s far from that. The acting is bad, over the top sometimes and not believable. The main actor is good but he can´t keep up being the leading actor. Anyway, I´ll stop here. Not a good movie.

      "I'm genuinely baffled by the \"paint by the numbers\" or \"expected\" in a bad way criticism surrounding this film. In my opinion, this movie aptly achieves its intended purpose, flawlessly encapsulating the intricate dance of love and loathing, especially in the face of power, wealth, and beauty.Oliver is bright and underestimated by all. Even his fellow outcasts at school underestimate just how smart Oliver is. This movie allows Oliver to both earn our trust then betray it, and then subtly blame the audience for buying into his story. While there's a certain predictability to the overarching plot, the desire to believe in an alternative outcome is what holds our attention. On some level, we know where the story is going, but you want to believe differently. The same can be said for every character outside of Oliver.The wealthy family embodies the callousness of the rich - who collect, use, and discard people for their amusement. The character, Pamela, is an example of the family's indifference toward their \"guests,\" consuming their lives for entertainment but barely acknowledging it when it turns out her claims of death threats turn out to be true. Using the British cliché, the most important thing in these peoples' world is to keep calm and carry on. Their money and status allow them to run the lives of others and distance themselves whenever anything gets too uncomfortable.Saltburn serves as a mirror reflecting the hypocrisy shared by both outcasts and the affluent. The girl who is left outside of Felix's room is only using Oliver to make Felix jealous, and once she realizes he won't be, she leaves. Farleigh is brash and confrontational with Oliver for \"not belonging\" when he knows that he too is a charity case, not to mention, one of the few brown people in the entire sphere. Venetia is looking for any sense of control and plays with Oliver like a toy, getting off on the thrill of ruining her brother's playthings, and both pities and lusts after Oliver throughout the film. As Oliver says, they are all prey without a predator, at least until he comes along.The film doesn't strive to be shockingly unpredictable; in fact, during the climax, it likens itself to a jack-in-the-box. You've been turning the story over, knowing what to expect, and you kept on anyway. As do the characters in the film, constantly challenging fate because deep down they all know how their stories end. Oliver just helps them get there.The graveyard scene deserves applause for its nuanced portrayal of the complex interplay between love and hate. Oliver's tumultuous emotions toward Felix-love, hate, longing to be him, and desiring to be with him-are masterfully depicted. In the end, everyone got what they wanted, even though Oliver is the only one who would be willing to admit it. He collected their lives much like they collected the lives of others. In fact, he has done the one thing our society \"praises\" in rags to riches stories - he worked for this money, something we never see the rich do. S altburn isn't aiming to be revolutionary; instead, it's a skillful exploration of our love and hate relationship with the wealthy and beautiful hand our willingness to risk it all for selfish reward. 0.126521164021164\n",

      "This was a disgusting, depraved, and truly degenerate film. Don't get me wrong - I love me some dark art with sex, death, shock, and horror. But this film did it in all the wrong ways. It shamelessly flaunts what it has not earned and spends what it has earned in very annoying ways. It has some great cinematography, good acting, promising plot elements, and directorial bravado. But this is precisely what makes the end product so punishing. It's all wrapped up in a plot that is ultimately cheap and shallow, centered on a character who is utterly unlikable.In the end, it is a counter-revolutionary film. The plot's broad outline feels adolescent and silly. **Spoiler Alert** A poor gay nerd falls for a popular rich hunk who may be queer. But plot twist! The nerd is actually a middle class pansexual psychopath who kills everyone!If this strange film is supposed to be a social commentary on capitalism or British aristocracy or the emptiness of modern life, then it utterly fails. The rich family are the real victims whom you pity because they are at least human. The redistribution of private property goes to the conniving middle class psychopath who is totally irredeemable and inhuman. The message seems to be that middle class people should remain content with the incredible wealth inequality of neoliberal capitalism because wanting more only leads to greed and corruption. After all, look at this degenerate...Maybe you're supposed to ignore all that because it's really a tale of obsession and the corrupting lust for power. Ok? And?? Obsession, corruption, and perversion exist. Got it. And they are bad. Yep... Now what is the deeper story??? The film has no answer, only gratuitous shock and pointless depravity.In another film, I could have loved his naked victory dance at the end. If he was a poor lad who cheated and killed to get to the top but had some charm or redeeming qualities, I could enjoy it. Maybe he could get caught in the end and some likable working class hero could put him to shame in equally shocking fashion? Or maybe that dance could conclude a daring feel-good movie about sticking it to the rich where the hero gets to the top without doing little things like, I don't know, killing everyone, licking up bodily fluids, and copulating with a grave.But no, he just had to go and do all that. And instead of enjoying the sight of a dweeb turned Greek God whose large endowment shines forth as he prances about his rightful palace, I am watching in agony with one final thought for this counter-revolutionary monstrosity: thank god this disgusting nightmare is almost over. 0.029757180650037806\n",
      "This movie was great in some ways. The cinematography was stunning even in some of the most unpleasant scenes. Barry keoghan definitely puts in an Oscar deserving preformance in my opinion. The plot and script are really good and I'm actually in love with the ending. The movie was really funny at times but didn't come off as a mindless comedy whatsoever.As much as I thought this movie was great there were many times I thought this movie was physically repulsive.

      "I was pessimistic Elordi was going to do a good job portraying Felix (I was pleasantly surprised). On the contrary, this Keoghan guy - never seen him in anything before this, that being said he portrays such a good little twisted weirdo; it makes me think he's like that in real life. Oliver is very fluid he slips into everything (people mainly), his sexuality, how he infiltrates everything: family dynamics, Saltburn etc.The song choices were 'en pointe' though, and that twist at the end was wilding; the cinematography was visually harmonious and beautiful. However, the grave scene, 'that' blood scene, and the tub scene were wilding (Elordi looking like a greek god in that tub though). Additionally, \"I'm a vampire\" excuse me! Hold on let me go get a bucket to throw up in (eww)- but that's the beauty of it right!? Also that drain is disgusting - like hair? Germs? Bacteria? Foul it is!

      "I watched this movie twice. Once with my bsf and another time with my little cousin. Honestly, I went into it expecting the worst because of the reaction it received. Literally thought the most vile stuff was gonna be shown 24/7, but honestly it wasn't bad at all. The only part I kinda squirmed at was the \"vampire\" scene (watching that, as a woman, I was honestly just disgusted, but if that's your thing, live your truth ig).The acting done by Barry Keoghan made me uncomfortable which was perfect. He had the submissive doe eyes to show his true manipulative personality, and honestly the height helps this a lot. I'm not against short kings in the slightest.I love all of the little things that hint towards characters' personalities and the overall theme of the film and all of the little film elements put into this. You can definitely tell that there was a lot of thought put into this movie. Also can I just say that the aesthetic is immaculate🙏🏼. The choice to crop the film was great and I love the rich, dark romantic, summer vibe of the entire place. The title screen is also so visually pleasing. The soundtrack was stuck in my head for a long time as well, so I also applaud that.Overall, love the unsettling, psychological vibe of the movie, and the insane plot twist at the end. Could definitely have done without the weird scenes, but the movie has to stand out somehow. Cannot even describe my face when they arrived at Oliver's home and everything began to unravel. Would recommend this movie for sure if you like psychological thrillers! 0.04321253071253072\n",
      "Saltburn is kind of a messed up gothic play on the far superior \" The talented Mr Ripley\". There is a lot of excess and lavish cinematography for not much payoff. It's just there for the sake of it. The leads are fine but it's not Jude Law and Matt Damon. The central character played by Barry Keoghan simply doesn't have the acting chops to pull off the protagonists cunning in a way that you believe it. He is apt at best. Better actors- Carey mulligan and to a lesser extent Rosamund Pike are not utilised that well. The movie tries to be smart and stylish - it fails the smart test and the stylish is replaced for substance. This generally never bodes well for a film. The final denouement - which is the highlight of the film comes in the last 10 mins. But is it worth the two hour wait? Not for me. 0.23417658730158727\n",

      "I have to agree with all those other reviews that gave this 1 to 3 points.I came to it having read the mixed media reviews but with optimistic expectations and was very disappointed..So I wont repeat most of what's been said already in those reviews on imdb ......just don't waste your time on thisI gave it 2 points rather than 1 because some of the cinematography and acting are quite good - though not a lot of actual acting required given the appalling script & 2 dimensional characters.And the soundtrack is pleasingly distracting from what is a lot of very derivative tosh.Shocking scenes of a perverse sexual nature......not really.....no idea even why they're there....they don't add anything to the narrative & I found them predictable/unbelievable. Presumably for a \"let's see if we can shock the audience & reviewers\" effect.Not a single character I felt any real interest in or empathy with.As for the 'shock reveal' ending.....what the......completely unbelievable after only a few seconds of considering what the shallow & thin narrative had told me over a boring previous 2 hours.On reading my review I wonder why I even gave it 2 points......Like I said earlier don't waste your time.If you want to watch films about the strange/dysfunctional behaviour of the English aristocracy then you're much better off (by light years) watching Brideshead Revisited, The Shooting Party, Gosford Park or even Downton Abbey....and for comparison generally The Talented Mr Ripley is in a totally different & superior class of film making. 0.04511904761904762\n",
      "I'll talk optimistically first. The cinematography might be some of my only positive input, and even then the 4:3 film ratio feels quite pretentious. It was a beautifully shot film, with some aesthetically satisfying scenes scattered throughout. I think Keoghan's acting was good, and Pike's character was played incredibly (as a personal fan of her work).The main focus of the story feels like a montage of shock factor material, but not even well executed or for the right reasons; just to make the audience feel physically unwell. It's as if the aim was to feature the most \"shocking\" scenes in Tiktok trends. Any of the \"originality\" found in this film (*cough* grave scene) was just an excuse for shock value. Reflecting on the aesthetically pleasing scenes, it might be that these were also sprinkled in just for the aim of gaining traction and attention on social media.There was minimal character exploration and depth; it all just felt a little shallow for my taste. I found that it was really difficult to root for any of the characters in the movie, which instantly makes the movie difficult to enjoy.It was painstakingly obvious what Oliver was doing from the beginning, when we found out that he didn't have any explicit family troubles and that he actually was privileged, it just felt like pure exploitation for the hell of it. Felix and his family just came across as hilariously pretentious, and not in an endearing way!I tried to find some kind of deeper meaning to it, but any deeper meaning found was originally created in the movies that it clearly took inspiration (or stole) from.The story itself was like a horrible combination of ideas taken from Parasite and The Talented Mr Ripley, which are both fantastic and inspirational movies that deserve better development than this.The 3 stars are for the acting, when considering the content of the film itself, I think it's quite impressive that the writing and the actors managed to make the most of a not-so-great execution.

      "Emerald Fennell delivers another stunning directorial effort, this woman is a force to be reckoned with. Perhaps not quite as tight as Promising Young Woman - there are a few too many plot holes, but the ability to present what looks like one thing - a parody of the English class system and then turn into a dark version of itself is a real skill that we should applaud. The basic plot of working class wannabe (Keoghan) desperately seeking the approval and friendship of golden posh boy (Elordi) is a tale as old as time and for the first third of the film that is what it all seems to be about but once he gets an invite to spend the summer at the posh family mansion a more sinister tale starts to unravel with shocking reveals. All the cast are first rate, Keoghan in particular is on fantastic form and eats up the screen and Elordi and Pike give strong nuanced performances.

      "I was sceptical about watching Saltburn because I was afraid it would be another overhyped film.To my surprise, I actually thought that this plot was very fun to watch!As some may say, it doesn't really go much into depth, yet I think that's what makes it silly, it is supposed to give you that fever dream-ish feeling, especially when combined with the cinematography. All the scenes were beautifully executed, the angles, the outfits and the colours all added to the dreamy yet mysterious feeling delivered by this film.I think many are missing the point that Oliver Quick was in fact not a poor kid coming from an addict family, but possibly a sociopath that was obsessed with Felix. The obsession obviously did not end with Felix's death, rather it spread over the rest of the family, resulting in him taking over the Saltburn estate. In the end, it is evident that it wasn't just his love or lust for Felix that took him there, but moreover his greed and lust for power.Barry Keoghan's acting was excellent, and the fact that some scenes were suggested by him in order to go more in depth of Oliver Quick just shows commitment.One thing that I didn't quite get was the killing spree after Felix's death, I believe it was a bit rushed, especially considering the loose strings like the butler who is very observant and yet not observant enough to recognize Oliver's doings?Either way, not every film has to fit everyone's rationale and not every film needs to be super logical whatsoever.I believe some films can be enjoyed by looking at the bigger picture and their irony. 0.1621025641025641\n",

The film is often provocative in scenes more so surrounded by the opulence of such a grand estate of Saltburn. The acting is wonderfully professional with Cary Mulligan again proving she can do more than looking cute. It contains subject matter that intimates, \"anything goes\" in their world of depravity, money and a dash of lunacy. There is subject matter which I was not expecting which gave me a jolt but kept me riveted until the very end, after seeing the film you will understand.

      "I seriously question the praise for this movie. What is going on with people so easily taken in by this because it's supposed to be a dark comedy or satire?The way the main character gets off on the bodily fluids of certain characters is for shock . The idea is that he's vampiric in his obsession with them but Emerald Fennell who wrote and directed it chooses one of the most grotesque ways of expressing this. It's supposedly a lampooning of the wealthy but they come across in a way we have grown to use to. Self satisfied, rude , patronizing when they play their games with lower classes and wannabes. If anything it seems to be saying beware of anyone not impossibly wealthy they will take advantage. Nothing the main character does to them makes us care about them so it's all pointless.Parasite was good commentary topic of classism. Saltburn is dreadful. Some decent acting but not enough to make a difference .I also get tired of being told something is a dark comedy when it isn't. Fargo was a good dark comedy with a moral center and genuinely funny as well.

It really has it all and as such would have deserved a higher score, but for the unnecessary shock factor scenes that actually just made me feel uncomfortable and took me out of the whole viewing experience.Even for me, an extremely broad minded viewer who has watched and appreciated some very severe scenes in many films, certain parts in this movie went just slightly too far.The bathroom scene where Oliver spies on Felix pleasuring himself in the bath was clearly important to show that Oliver's love for Felix was far more than just as a friend or hero worship, BUT the lingering closeup of Oliver licking and sucking the bath water as it drains away was absolutely and totally unnecessary. It gave the viewer no additional insight into the story or characters and was purely added to shock and make the viewer feel awkward and uncomfortable.An even worse example was at Felix's funeral, when Oliver is left alone to show his grief. For me this was one of the most important scenes in the entire film. It clearly demonstrated Oliver's sole destroying loss of his greatest friend and someone he loved more than anyone or anything else. Made even more heartbreaking by the fact that you now realise Oliver had felt no option other than to kill Felix, as Felix was no longer going to have anything to do with him and would force him out of Saltburn. As he lay distraught on Felix's grave I actually began to shed a tear as it was so beautifully filmed. Then from nowhere he takes all his clothes off and appears to attempt to have sex with Felix on top of his grave. A GREAT SCENE AND ALL EMOTION TOTALLY DESTROYED !!!I understand certain films need to shock and borderline disgust the viewer momentarily, such as the horrific and gruesome Saw traps, which actually adds something to these scenes in that type of film, but in an excellent drama such as this I was genuinely taken out of the movie and any emotions, rather than being drawn even further into it. Very much like an unnecessary pit stop in a race, where you then have get yourself back in and rebuild momentum again.Writer's and director's should be horrified that these over the top and unnecessary shock sequences actually detract from the whole movie watching experience. It's not funny or clever to trick the ticket paying customers with this type of cheap and unnecessary shock factor !!! 0.07240792410714288\n",
      "The performances in \"Saltburn\" are commendable, but the film feels like a rip-off of \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" novel (not the movie), borrowing heavily from its plot elements and character design. Unfortunately, unlike the novel, \"Saltburn\" falls short in delivering the psychological depth and occasional sensibility.E.g.Oliver, the protagonist, who fails to have even one successful date on campus, suddenly exhibits a sexually charismatic and dominant persona, capable of bringing Farleigh Start, an alpha carefree cool kid, into submission. The scene is well-performed thanks to its superb actors, but it contradicts the core personality of the characters. The director suddenly bestows superpowers upon their underdog character, resulting in an unearned character twist. This instance is just one example of such inconsistencies throughout the film. 0.11111111111111109\n",
      "\"Saltburn\" is a film that is beautiful to look at, yet leaves you reeling with discomfort at the madness involved.This film truly is a soap opera; lots of drama, lots of crazy turns, lots of sexuality.

The lighting is often unorthodox (scenes are light from backlight, scenes are light with low candle light, scenes are light with glaring sunlight). The aspect ratio is often disarming when compared to the lush, beautiful, and chaotic visuals on display.In the end, \"Saltburn\" is a film that has a main character who's actions leave an unsettling and lasting sting. 0.20555555555555557\n",

The main character's obsession is same with Mr. Ripley and their dressing style is also similar. Most importantly the topic of the movie is sooo similar. I hope the people who is criticizing movies notice this similarity. The movie that I was talking about hes released at 1999, Matt Demon, Jude Law and Gwenth Paltrow are the main characters.

The shock value scenes objectively make this movie 'interesting', but if you strip the movie of them, then the story has been told tens of times - in a better way - and it leaves only a visual spectacle, which is notably beautiful, but in comparison with the rest of the movie it just feels *so* stale.I'm not against weird disturbing scenes...it's just that the story has been told already and the only difference was a castle, bad pacing (this movie needed to be 20 minutes shorter), worse story telling, and fetishized grotesque sex stuff.The ending was also *SOO* lazy.

You can see how he wanted to appropriate the home and everything in it, as well as the storage life of the very rich. Got to give it to Oliver, he was a great actor.

I was completely invested in watching the ups and downs and manipulation of the main character as it slowly progressed and got increasingly insane before realising what was going on. The ending was really well done and I'm glad the whole story came together with really cool reveals. The cherry on top was the final scene, not because of the obvious but just cause I felt it beautifully topped off the movie and the main characters sanity. Some moments made me gag a bit but nothing really felt out of place for me, I don't think anything was put in just to be a cheap shock, each of the 'shocking' scenes added to the sanity of the character.

      "This is a film not for everyone but if you like your class based satire with lashings of jet black humour and sinister undertones its one to watch. I LOVED it. I had to stifle my laughter at times just like I did with Yorgos Lanthimos' The Killing of a Sacred Deer, also starring the ubiquitously brilliant Barry Keoghan. He's quickly becoming one of my favourite actors and it's great to see him in a lead role of a major movie. Similarly excellent turns from Rosalyn Pike and Richard E Grant, and look out for a cameo from Carey Mulligan who starred in the director's last (first?) film Promising Young Woman, which was equally sinister. Most notable is a quietly hilarious piece of acting from Grant when he quips about the simplicity of karaoke. It's genius. The film is a must watch again 8.5 out of ten. 0.2664351851851852\n",

The acting and directing here is good but it didn't help me enjoy the movie. The film is also very disturbing and not in a good way in my opinion. I just felt disgusted watching the movie and not in a way that I found it interesting. It was just weird. There weren't any scenes or characters that stood out to me either. Overall it's a pretty well made movie from a technical perspective but it's not one that made me think or one that I had any enjoyment with. 3/10. -6.938893903907228e-18\n",

Rosalind Pike is awesome 👏! Barry Keoghan turns in another amazing role. Richard E Grant is in his reliable and gut wrenching prime. Supporting actors playing Venetia and Felix are mesmerizing and serve up surprises right when they are expected to.Saltburn is a psychological thriller dressed as a class warfare flick.

      "The movies portrayal of a godawful, sickening, disgusting, pity full and stomach churning person was really good. They managed to catch the essence of a person who you know is not right in their mind and makes you want to stay 200 meters away from them but at the same time makes you feel sorry for them. (Kind of?)Except for the fact that Oliver makes me want to burn my skin off I do think the actor did a really good job. He did his work and made people feel something, and thats a good thing in my book.The movie is worth while watching because of the great acting, its story, the shots and the scenes but I wouldn't recommend this to just anyone. Only if you specifically ask about this movie or are asking about a movie that will make you wan't to throw up during the entirety of it will I recommend it.

I expected 'Call me by your name' vibes and it gave that at the very beginning, then toward the middle I realised that this is much more than just gay sex. I mean.

Lots of pretty colors, lots of beautiful people, and lots of amazing rooms and settings. The whole movie is eye candy.Saltburn is a slow burn, but from the beginning, you get an eerie sense that not all is quite as it seems. That just escalates as the movie goes on, which leads to a twist ending that was not completely unexpected. However, I think that works really well in this movie. If you are paying attention, you can see the ending coming. If it would have been a twist totally out of left field, I don't think it would have worked as well.Some people will say this movie was too slow. I thought it moved along well enough, slowly building and building and building. I enjoyed the pacing and the character development and setting development that happened over time.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!About halfway through the movie, I thought to myself... Is this a horror movie? And I'd say that, in some ways, yes it is, perhaps in the same vein but not nearly as horrific as Midsommer.Everyone in the movie was weird as heck, but Oliver was by far the weirdest. I can't help but wonder what happened between him and his family after he claimed Saltburn as his own. Did they never hear from him ever again? I'm going to guess that no, they did not, and probably that happened after he left Saltburn that first time. 0.1005\n",

But why? Was his goal just wealth? Originally it felt as if he was in love with the tall cute felix the cat which was understandable.

      "Creative cinematography and great acting are the first noticeable strengths of this film. The film starts with fast cut of detail shots and later efficiently moves to one long \"onesie\" shot of the main character entering the campus. Such dynamic visual story telling continues throughout the film. However, what is less apparent perhaps, is the astute directing and very subtle choice that shows something interesting about the character instead of explaining via dialogue. For example, the Catton family is introduced sitting in an opulent room but their behavior does not really match the setting. They look crowded and in a way lazy in their disposition. I personally felt a visual incongruence, and as a viewer, I got a sense that the family is detached from the realities from the world and just live in inherent leisure. I find this just one of many examples of clever directing and attention to details.Although the film is captivating across the plot, I found the very ending a bit flat. Giving us a the retrospective explanation that everything was a ploy engineered by the main character falls short when compared to the interpersonal dynamics explored through the rest of the film. That shortcoming maybe falls on the writer, so having said that, the filmmakers did really best with the script they were given. 0.16073667711598744\n",

With the follow-up to her \"Promising Young Woman\" debut, writer / director Emerald Fennell creates impact (inc with some 'shock' scenes) but wastes Carey Mulligan's minor support and serves up a disappointingly rushed & twee ending.

      "Interesting and perhaps accurate depiction of the British aristocratic class. Great performances by Rosamund Pike (as always) and Barry Keoghan. The parents were hilariously self absorbed and there was quite a bit of humor throughout. I agree with another reviewer's comparison to the Talented Mr. Ripley as that occurred to me as well as Oliver revealed his chameleon like nature. The movie definitely became more intriguing toward the end as you began to see additional layers of Oliver's character. My reaction to quite a number of scenes was \"how bizarre\" (the bath water and graveyard scenes are several examples) but as Oliver is a psychopath I guess it provided a deeper insight into the depth of his depravity. His mental condition became more obvious over time so the first scene was perhaps more shocking. This movie is not everyone's cup of tea but should be enjoyable to those who enjoy offbeat movies. 0.23571428571428577\n",
      "So it's a film where the central character is a psychopath and, like with Ripley, at least in the first book, not a particularly charismatic one. But it's not a suspense film like The Talented ...etc or Psycho because, unless I was being obtuse, you don't really get a hint ,until somewhere into the last quarter about what's going on. It is quite witty. Felix states that some of his ancestors were sources for Evelyn Waugh and it's clear that Felix's ancestral home and family bear a distinct (though in some cases inverted) comparison to the Marchmains.

      "There are probably only two camps when it comes to this movie. Some will celebrate it (and misunderstand it), others will reject it because they find it undemanding and confusing. I belong to the second category. Maybe I'm too old and have seen enough movies to be able to say that the plot of Saltburn isn't really new. I also know Absolutely Fabulous, so I can see quite clearly that Rosamunde Pike seems to have stolen from Jennifer Saunders. Her dialog, her tone of voice, everything is reminiscent of Edwina Monsoon, Saunders' character. Apart from that, this comedy is not a comedy at all, but mixes satire with drama, is rarely funny, but mostly you wait for the supposedly too obscene scenes, only to realize that they are more likely the result of good marketing around the film. Yes, they are unusual, but they fit well with the character of the main character, a narcissist who thinks he has fallen for someone, but whose real goal is something completely different. You eventually realize that this Oliver is not the victim he claims to be, but an exceedingly clever fellow who has the entire aristocracy in his pocket. Emereld Fennell's direction is addicted to beautiful images on the one hand, but on the other we see party scenes like something out of a bad Spanish TV series.

      "Smart villains as anti-heroes of have often been an appealing setup for the stories of many movies - not in this case. While the movie portraits Oliver as a smart guy, in it for the long game, each one of his murders should have been easy for the police to solve. That the movie doesn't even consider this (or provides the least bit of an explanation for why the police doesn't do its job) shows how flawed the story is. The sad thing about this flawed and incredibly predictable movie is that the creators seem to believe that they came up with sth smart. Disappointing and not worth watching.

      "I get the comparisons to 'Talented Mr Ripley' but what I kept thinking about throughout this movie was Alan Hollinghurst's 'The Line Of Beauty'. Middle class student, ashamed of his background and family falls in unrequited love with wealthy fellow student and ingratiates himself with his family which includes affable but ultimately bombastic father, charming but chilly mother and troubled sister. Towards the end of that story, the family are also asking our protagonist \"Why are you still here?\" but Emerald Fennell here adds a much darker twist to the tale!This movie starts off well. The characters are interesting, the performances are good and the story is initially intriguing. Like many viewers, I laughed delightedly at most of Rosmaund Pike's lines and I was keen to see where the story was going. That lasted up until just after Felix meets the parents. Then it all went rapidly downhill. I suppose, ulitmately, I was disappointed in the story choices after that! To be honest, for me there were problems with pacing quite early on. I felt that the first two thirds dragged and then the last third races on so quickly that it becomes almost farcical - perhaps that was the intention; it is black comedy after all! In the end, I just found it all a bit silly and not even remotely believable.There are positives. It looks splendid throughout and the cinematography is just beautiful. Sometimes it is very funny and I sort of wish that Fennell had stuck to that and just produced a straight up comedy. Rosamund Pike is glorious throughout and steals the show but I also enjoyed Jacob Elordi too. Barry Keoghan is undoubtedly very talented but his character is so very unlikeable that its difficult to come out of this with a good impression of him!

      "Saltburn is one of the most confusing storylines ever. The plot doesn't stick together and doesn't make sense at all. Everything starts with a boy with a hidden secret that he's gay. Then he's not, then he is, and suddenly something different happens. You know, it's nothing in the plot that you can connect to or feel concerned about, until the end. The end concludes the story, and everything makes suddenly sense. But the previous hour and forty minutes, doesn't. The main character (That is either protagonist or antagonist, not sure) is not likable, even if they tried to make you like him. The audience is supposed to be concerned about him, but the plastic acting, expressions and the character development that nobody gives a damn about doesn't fix the situation either. His \"love\" connection with his friend is showed as a thing that comes in and out of the film, something that's sometimes is very important, while other times they focused on something way different. They waste time on long unnecessary scenes that doesn't change the course of action at all. They even put in some scenes to express our main hero some more, but I interpreted it in a bad way. If I separate the film in three parts, then I would say a confusing beginning, boring middle and a dull, yet understandable ending. Two stars for ok pictures and scenography, and an ending that finally concludes this boring story. The music was decent, it fit the film, but not a technical that I got really impressed about.

He slowly crawls his way into the clasp of the family and charms his way in.Probably this year's 'Babylon', the film's inversion of the eat the rich concept just does not work. Like Babylon, it has a lot of problems.The characterization here is lacking. No one here feels like you know them by the end of the film. Even with a lot twitter clippings of quotes, it never really say much about the character. It shows their disposition BUT in the end, they felt so hallow. Even Keoghan's character is so empty and contradictory. He wants to be accepted and take it all but why? Loved, and Loved him, he say mockingly towards the end. EMPTY NOISES. You never really see any POV of the main characters true self.Then the biggest and probably most jarring is the commentary the film implies. That the poor and the middle class are 'biting the hand' of the gentile elites. The cousin, the the other scholar, the teacher and (ultimately) Keoghan's character are only shown almost at the mercy of the rich AND are ultimately at their predisposal, which was shockingly icky. Here's where the lack of POV or characterization made it even worse. Talented Mr Ripley works because you know from the get go that he wants to be rich and the rich character actually shows what he thinks of him(BUT the ending is awful). Teorema works because the Keoghan character is a foil for change for the elite - good or bad. Here, the Keoghan is indicted AND he has nothing but 'the implication' to stand on. There is no real reason for him to do it nor any POV from for the Saltburn peeps for him to have that reaction.Interesting watch.

      "The visuals were stunning, the acting was good and the music really made the scenes come alive.However I have a big issue with this movie: it's supposed to critique the rich lifestyle but it came across as the complete opposite to me? Yeah, there were a few scenes where they say stupid things, but they are still made out to be lovable, quirky, absent-minded or just stupid or mean. Forgivable human flaws. Emerald Fennel (whose first film, Promising Young Woman, I loved) is herself part of the elite she's supposedly trying to critique, so I wonder if that had anything to do with the relatability bias I kept noticing throughout the movie. She is clearly aware of systemic misogyny and its effects on young women (presumably because she's been affected by it), but she seems oblivious to the same principle when it comes to social class.Oliver is presented as a sociopath who would lie, cheat, or kill his way to the top, and that's just giving ordinary people a bad name. While I'm sure there are some people from working class backgrounds who would do anything to become rich, they most probably wouldn't succeed even if they did all those horrible things. Statistics say it's very hard to move upwards socially, and if you are going to change social classes, it will most probably be downwards. Most working class people don't want endless wealth, they just want to not worry about everything all the time and enjoy the limited free time they have.While I'm sure there are also lots of lovable rich people with nice personalities out there, the reality remains that society and its rules are made by and biased towards the rich, so even the most talented working class psychopath trying to deceive the rich and steal their assets would be caught in the act. There're a lot of plotholes, which makes me think the story wasn't very well designed, they were more focused on appearances and emphasising certain ideas. I'm pretty sure the family would've been more suspicious of this random person coming to their house, they would've definitely checked his background and found out he was lying. Why would he lie as well? Would you? Why are they choosing to show the most dramatic exaggerated facets of humanity instead of the regular? How come the police didn't investigate all those \"accidental\" deaths better? Let's be real, they would've arrested Oliver in the blink of an eye. How were they all so smitten with this guy? It doesn't make sense. He would've been much more humiliated in real life. Which just shows me how the writers have no clue about real life and how most of us experience things. That's what I want to see on screen. Actual stories, actual struggles, real people I can relate to. And this rich posh person is not going to know how to show that. Nope. She's portraying poor people as pathological liars with no morality and rich people as gullible ditzy sweethearts who harmed no one, just happened to be rich, which is sadly not how most rich people acquire wealth.Don't even get me started on all the disgusting scenes.

      "In the fall of 2023, a strange black comedy thriller called Saltburn was released to the public, marking the second feature film directed by Emerald Fennell. While the film did garner fairly positive reviews and modest box office success, the film had already been massively anticipated due to new rising stars Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi being in the lead roles. So with a fairly hyped up movie at float, it briefly became a hit for Amazon MGM and garnered a strange cult following on TikTok. But what exactly made this film such a talked about phenomenon on social media a few months ago?The film follows socially awkward Oxford student Oliver Quick who arouses a popular, aristocratic student named Felix Catton. After Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer at his eccentric family's estate, the seemingly naive young man slowly begins to con his way into their lifestyle. Now as much as this film seems to have taken clear inspiration from arguably better received works like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Brideshead Revisited, I would rather analyze the film for what it does on its own rather than waste time on comparing it to works I have not yet seen. With that being said, the story of Oliver wooing his way into the life of a young man with a higher social class than himself is well established as a questionably unsettling tale of lies and corruption from a charismatic grifter. As much as the film critiques the rich and elite, it does so at the expense of presenting Felix and his family as people too caught up in their lies while still having genuine concern for one another. It's great to see a narrative like this tackled in the modern age, especially with how disturbing its subject matter is.However, with all that said and done, perhaps the film thinks it's a bit more clever and profound than it actually appears to be. Because the film implies that Oliver is more in love with Felix as a concept relating to a status he dreams of rather than as a legitimate human being, the devastatingly immoral actions he performs on him and his family are quite gruesome and shocking in practice. Unfortunately, the depictions of these actions are presented in such a juvenile manner that Oliver feels more like a comical cartoony villain rather than legitimately intimidating. It doesn't help that the film's commentary on rich classism is never explored much beyond the Catton's eccentric lifestyle and delusions of grandeur, so it makes the conclusion a bit too obvious for its own good. Also, while some characters like Felix's distant cousin Farleigh and sister Venetia have good roles in opposing Oliver's actions, they aren't utilized enough to feel as impactful as they could have been. Maybe the cast could have benefited from more screen time, especially when what we're mainly seeing on screen is more silly than scary.Admittedly, the filmmaking techniques employed in Saltburn do a nice job of bringing us into its lush extravagant environments and settings, complete with elite production design and phenomenal world building. The costumes also reflect the Cattons' day to day livelihoods quite well, if not just for showmanship. Unfortunately, as gorgeous as the production qualities are, there doesn't seem to be much to take away from them beyond it fitting the straightforward murder story that is set in stone, so what you're left with is a sadly hollow array of beauty and vigor not worth caring much for. It's not to say that the filmmakers didn't do their job at crafting such luscious environments so much as they seem to just do obvious ploys for Olier's actions like creeping stairwells, trippy mazes or even bathtubs pathetically enough. Even Anthony Willis' chilling score doesn't stick out much from other psychological thrillers of this caliber. So it should be safe to say that the crew behind the film made the most out of their resources, albeit not in a way that feels as fresh or engaging as they should be.There has rarely been a film I've been as torn on with my feelings on as Saltburn, since its mere existence fascinates me more than it genuinely intrigues me. On one hand, the film's commentary and subject matter are far more superficial than it might say otherwise, but on the other hand, what it offers could still intrigue people from its mere presentation alone and for just how messed up it is, regardless of the quality. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least check out for curiosity's sake, although don't be surprised if you walk away having almost no idea how to feel about it afterwards. 0.1020936639118457\n",

It initially seemed like Barry Keoghan's character, Oliver Quick, a seemingly grounded Liverpudlian, would make an interesting foil for aristocratic eccentricity. Instead, as the film progresses, we end up with a mirage of sociopaths. The cast, as a whole, does very well to portray each character's flaws. But the interactions between them have undercurrents of spitefulness, in scenes designed to shock more than inform. The result is a narrative that distances the viewer and moves the collective film into the realm of absurdity.

Then it is more like Ripley on steroids in a universe that really do not make sense.The protagonist Oliver has the same kind of personality like Ripley, copying, blending in, using situations created by him to come in to the warmth of wealth, status and partying. But there is a huge differense. Ripley is interesting and you kind of get where he is coming from and in the same time he is mysterious. Also the environment in Ripley (Italy) is captivating in another kind of way. The environment plays a huge role in this kind of movies. And even though the extravagant parties in Saltburn are esthetical to the eye. They are not so much more than that.Of course both psychopaths protagonists are monsters and terrible human beeings and in real life you would despise them and they are in many ways the lowest of a life form. But since it is a movie you have to keep the character interesting to keep the story going. A true psychopath with shallow goals do not get even remotely interesting.But the worst part is that it is totally unreal. The police seems to not exist. This part must be done with intent. The movie is not taken itself serious. And this is a strange choice by the director. Because the first two parts are not like that at all. It becomes only obscene, kind of banal and extremely predictable.At times I think it is not meant to be taken seriously at all. More like a parody on Ripley and on Gatsby and on ultra rich life.

      "As I watched \"Saltburn,\" I couldn't shake off the feeling of déjà vu, not because it was reminiscent of a masterpiece, but because it shamelessly tried to emulate the brilliance of \"Parasite.\" While \"Parasite\" effortlessly weaved socio-economic commentary with dark humor and gripping suspense, \"Saltburn\" stumbled clumsily, trying too hard to replicate its success.The characters in \"Saltburn\" lacked depth, merely serving as caricatures of social classes without any real substance or development. Unlike the intricate web of relationships in \"Parasite,\" the dynamics between the characters in \"Saltburn\" felt forced and contrived.Furthermore, the plot of \"Saltburn\" failed to engage me. It meandered aimlessly, lacking the sharp wit and clever twists that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout \"Parasite.\" Instead of building tension organically, \"Saltburn\" relied on predictable clichés and shallow drama.Despite attempting to tackle similar themes of class divide and societal inequality, \"Saltburn\" lacked the nuance and finesse of \"Parasite.\" Where \"Parasite\" masterfully blurred the lines between right and wrong, \"Saltburn\" delivered its message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving little room for interpretation or introspection.In conclusion, while \"Saltburn\" may have hoped to ride the coattails of \"Parasite's\" success, it ultimately falls short, serving as a forgettable imitation rather than a worthy contender.

      "Saltburn (2023) flew under my radar almost undetected until I learned it was by the same director who did Promising Young Woman (2020). Since the blunt themes Emerald Fennell used in her previous film stuck with me, I gave Saltburn a try. Unfortunately, the magic that had me riveted in Promising Young Woman mostly had me cringing in Saltburn. Sure, there were still those shocking twists, but everything else on top of that was just...ugh. And maybe those shocking moments were the whole point.The acting in this movie was superb, especially Barry Keoghan as Oliver. I'm going to try to not give anything away, but his whole character arc felt like what The Count of Monte Cristo would have been if Edmund was the villain. That he throws himself into these uncomfortable moments so easily really sells the commitment to the part that Keoghan had here. There were other standout performances like Jacob Elordi's Felix and Rosamund Pike's Lady Elspeth, but they are almost insignificant compared to Keoghan.Of course, despite all those weird moments, they kind of define this movie's examination of obsession and usurpation. To cut them out does a disservice to the lengths that we sometimes go to get what we want. That we might do similar things when nobody else is watching is perhaps what makes it uncomfortable to watch as it shines a gross mirror on our baser tendencies. Ultimately, this doesn't excuse the fact that there were several moments that had me going, \"I wish I hadn't seen that.\" These scenes are stuck in my memory instead of the much more compelling third act, and that's the true shame of Saltburn.A gross look at obsession, I give Saltburn 2.0 stars out of 5. 0.04730392156862745\n",

Tasting Venetia's menstrual blood. The creepy sex with Farleigh.I'm clutching for a deeper meaning here bc it feels like there is one beyond the yuckiness of it all. Then having him hump Felix's grave was the final wtf moment.But yeah, the film has a huge twist. A HUGE twist. A totally unbelievable twist. At least with the TALENTED MR RIPLEY you knew what the main protagonist was up to and so you were kept wondering if he would get away with it. That created a lot of juicy tension. With SALTBURN you were being asked to be shocked or stunned. Almost like a whodunnit.

Dedicating two hours of your life to concentrate on watching this would only invite disappointment.I expected and wanted MORE from this film: more storyline, more character development, more reveals from the past, more explanation of why Oliver and other characters were the way they were. Without this, it lacked depth and became more and more unrealistic as it progressed.The really disappointing thing was that it could have been a great movie. The casting and acting were good, the location and set were amazing. It just wasn't put together well and lacked proper development of the storyline. 0.2630952380952381\n",

Of the much vaunted \"controversial\" scenes, a lot has already been said, but to be honest, if it had been a horror movie, they'd have been the gory jump scares. It's not the actors' fault that it's so dull. I give the cast top marks for doing pretty much everything that could be done with the script.

If it weren't for the nauseating scenes, the movie would be entirely unmemorable.At times, it's as if the screenwriter used Call me by your name as a template to write a flick about bisexuality involving a somewhat erudite family and gave it a psychological thriller twist. To say that Saltburn was inspired from The Talented Mr Ripley would do the latter great injustice.Saltburn is a classical example of form over substance. It relies on its dazzling set design and attractive cast, but comes short in terms of plot, character development and common sense.If anything, the movie manages to force visceral reactions out of the audience, an obvious sign that the writer uses shock value to compensate for a weak script.Barry Keoghan is as creepy as we saw him in The killing of a sacred deer. Rosamund Pike didn't seem convincing enough, in all honesty. But Jacob Elordi is a delicious hunk with a will to power and a kind heart who looks incredibly well in any dyonisiac setting. But that's it. His motives can only be inferred. His character development peaks in the labyrinth scene, where he makes a decision that is in stark contrast to any expectation that the audience might have, after Oliver's presumptuously alleges that Felix was in love with him, in the movie's preamble.7.2 is a much too high rating. 0.23277777777777778\n",

I won't go into the storyline, because the only thing people are talking about are the sex scenes. That's the main attraction of this movie.If you've been on TikTok, you would have noticed that people are posting clips of themselves with their friends or family watching the sex scenes.The scenes are the gimmick Ms. Fennell is using for the movie. A movie whose storyline is weak and unbelievable, and may I add, forgetable.This is Ms. Fennell's first written work of any kind since she tried her hand in writing for the theatre. A collaboration with Andrew Lloyd Webber of the epic failure of Cinderella. A musical in which she reinvented the storyline, and stretched out the production for 2 hours and 45 minutes.

      "I'll start by saying that my first exposure to this film was on a message board, where posters were talking about several disgusting scenes including the main character slurping the bath water of another individual who had apparently pleasured himself while in it, another where the main character orally pleasured a female who was menstruating and finally one of the main character nude and \"grinding\" on a freshly covered grave. I guess the say \"no publicity is bad publicity\" as I took the time to read some other reviews which were mixed. Many compared it to The Talented Mr. Ripley for a somewhat similar plot line of a \"con man\" ingratiating himself to a wealthy person only to later murder him and attempt to profit.I decided to go ahead and watch it, with the idea I'd turn it off it it got too bad.The movie starts off well enough. Barry Keoghan is Oliver Quick, a scholarship student who is an outcast at a new school. One day, he comes across a popular (and wealthy) student Felix whose bike has a flat tire and he loans him his. The two become friends despite some tension due to their backgrounds and social status. Felix seems to be drifting away however, before Oliver drops the bombshell that his drug dealing father has died...and that his equally drug addicted mother is a complete disaster. Felix decides to invite Oliver (don't call him Oscar) home to his big mansion for the summer.We come to find out that Felix and the Catton clan and pretty despicable and flawed people. Felix's mom Elsbeth has a house guest/pet project that she saved, but has since grown tired of and throws out in the middle of the night. When the woman later commits suicide, Elsbeth coldly says \"she'll do anything for attention\". Cousin Farleigh, also a student at school, acts terrible toward Oliver - in part because he himself is a \"pet project\" despite being family. Oliver is oddly obsessed with Felix, though they have a brief falling out over Felix hooking up with his sister Venitia after Farliegh rats him out. But they reconcile, and the rest of the fam likes Oliver and decides to throw him a birthday party. As a surprise, Felix also decides to take him to see him mom only to discover that.... Oliver totally lied about his middle class slightly nerdy but otherwise normal parents.From there, we get a weird themed birthday party with 200 people at a mansion who don't even know Oliver's name, Oliver professing his love to Felix in a maze, only to have Felix found dead the next morning with Oliver pining the blame on cousin Farliegh and his drug use. Of course, the family has to go along with lunch like nothings wrong. Oliver tries to seduce Venetia in the bathtub, only to have her reject him and later commit suicide. At some point in there, Oliver had relations with the mud covering Felix's grave. Old pop Catton decides to pay off Oliver to leave because, well, at this point it's just in the script. So he does.Flash forward to 14 years later. Elsbeth has a \"chance\" wink wink encounter with Oliver,\n",

We further find out that Oliver also initiated the flat tire on Felix's bike, and further set up a situation where Felix \"found\" some money he dropped so he could buy a round of shots during a bonding moment.The movie ends with Oliver now the owner of Saltburn dancing around naked.If it sounds like a lot to unpack, it was.

She is a judgmental snob who ultimately finds comfort in what she naively believes is a show of genuine compassion and affection.Barry Keoghan plays the lead role in the character, Oliver Quick. He is well cast as this sometimes difficult to read character. He pulls off both innocence and connivance. I must also commend the actor for having the courage and confidence to dance completely naked-revealing all. Perhaps this is a credit to his Irishness. I cannot think of a single American actor who has allowed himself to be so exposed on the big screen.There are some graphic scenes including one with menstrual blood and another involving sexual gratification from the dirt of a freshly covered gravesite. Such scenes appear to exist for their shock value without serving any particular narrative purpose. Perhaps I am simply shockproof at this stage of my life but the movie underwhelmed me. Jacob Elordi is gorgeous and charming and Rosamund Pike continues to impress and entertain me with the life she brings to every character she plays.

      "For the first 2 acts, everything is focused on the romance between the 2 characters, it feels like we never get a break from it. It's exhausting. There's nothing really happening externally to their relationship, other than the setting changes from college to a mansion. The obvious solution to the tension between the 2 would be a simple discussion on the nature of their relationship, but the movie needs it to drag on.The soundtrack is very well done and adds more gravitas to the scenes than they deserve. The music, photography and scenery will manipulate some audiences into thinking this film is artful and powerful, when it's really not.The characters are all written to be \"quirky\" to distract from an otherwise uninteresting premise. Felix's parents especially. After his death, they sit and eat lunch like nothing happened. It's eye-rollingly silly and this has been done before. It seems like they deliberately wrote it that way to illicit a strong reaction from the audience, but I'm confused whether I'm supposed to be laughing, perplexed, or disgusted? In that sense, it feels exploitative. In other words, the characters only exist as tools to be exploited to the audience. They don't feel like real people with motivations and desires, which makes it difficult to take anything seriously in this film. There are a number of scenes with only music and focusing for long periods of time on an actor. This time could've been better spent adding meat to their relationship. Although the 3rd act makes it clear that this movie isn't actually about their relationship, but Oliver being a psychopath.Oliver lies about being an only child and his father dying to gain Felix's affections. In the scene where they meet Oliver's parents, why would Felix allow his lie be exposed without putting up some resistance? It's not like his parents were invited to his birthday party, so I'm confused why they needed to meet them in the first place. Especially with Oliver knowing he'd be exposed as a pathological liar. It doesn't make sense. The events should've unfolded differently- maybe Felix finds out accidentally by answering Oliver's phone and his \"Dead\" father is on the line.The scene where Oliver takes off his pants over Felix's grave and thrusts into the ground was so tasteless. Did they have an actual relationship or was it just a sexual fantasy? The twist at the end was somewhat redeeming. However, I felt betrayed by the change in tone because it seemed like this movie was trying to be a romantic drama. I respect the movie for trying to do something different than the usual Hollywood drivel. But ultimately the formula did not work here. It's a depressing, depraved and dark movie. It meanders in it's own self importance and feels like a direct-to-streaming film with a lack of studio oversight. -0.02040816326530612\n",
      "I got Felix's name wrong. I called him Jake. Oh well. Sorry. I must have had 16 Candles in mind when I called him Jake. The character's name was Felix and not Jake. Goes to show how memorable it all was. The guy playing him, however, was extremely handsome and very young. If he were to do some body-work and bulk up just a bit he would be over the top, \"oh my god i cant stop looking at him\" beautiful. It also may have been a big help to the plot if Felix was given at least one full frontal shot (could have most definitely led to the sorely lacking motive of Oliver). I can't be alone in that thought; I mean, this film must have missed an X rating by a smidge, so why not slap a prosthetic on Felix and really go for it? 0.1369642857142857\n",

But I see it as an ominous version of Le Tartuffe or Down and Out in Beverly Hills with a little Wes Anderson flavor mixed in, maybe even with a dash of Ed Norton from Primal Fear. It is odd and quirk and repeats an overused storyline of people being duped. But it doesn't really pull it off completely. Oliver's family appears in the storyline and then they aren't really brought up again. The deaths are all suspicious, yet each time, the next death isn't stopped.

      "Stylish, Saltburn defies and shuffles any possible thread of logic. Its potential is obvious, and its vibrant cinematography - which carries the film without sign of fatigue - and strong performances by Keoghan, Elordi and Pike only add to its charm. Its conflicting identity and torn plot, however, leave us longing for something that was never truly delivered.First hinting at a romance that, despite its crooked ways, was reminiscent of Call Me By Your Name (2017) then at a class struggle intrigue that never reached nor dreamed of the heights of Parasite (2019), Fennel ultimately failed to deliver her own distinctive and cohesive narrative which, conflicted and lost between genres, ended up burning its identity.Bluntly, Saltburn tried to weave more threads than it could handle - it outlined countless intriguing storylines but never followed them nor gave them a satisfying conclusion. Oliver's first scary Oxford friend. The creepy butler who, despite his uncanny stare, never seemed to see anything. Venetia's anorexia and insecurity, especially when faced by her ex-model mother who despised ugliness. The previous year's stay of another Felix friend. Sir Catton who, underused, became completely forgettable. Even Farleigh's relation to his mother and her poverty, alongside his hatred towards Oliver, in the end, seemed underdeveloped as the character became one-noted. All these threads add little to no value to the film when they could've and should've not only enriched it but turned it into a living and breathing castle-world.Instead, other than Elordi's Felix, no character seemed, for most of the film, real nor driven by soul, instead moved by plot lines as if wicked programmed robots. Moreover, the third act demanded a huge and unearned suspension of disbelief as, Pike's Elspeth, for some inexplicable reason, invites Oliver to Saltburn again, quickly falling ill and leaving him all her vast fortune. In a nutshell, too much happened too quickly without the causal mechanisms that should have been built throughout the run that, despite lacking, seemed too long.Despite all this heavy criticism, not all was stark. Although clichéd at times, the movie boasts stunning, vibrant, and atmospheric cinematography. It also features some well-crafted foreshadowing, particularly through Oliver's reflections when he first spots Felix and the family lunch scene after the disaster. Oliver's unreliable narration throughout the film was, too, a highlight as it built both mystery and suspense, even though the final ridiculous and unnecessary explanatory exhibition of the true chain of events almost ruined it. Finally, the leading performances, especially by Keoghan and Elordi, who continue their brilliant paths, as well as Rosamund Pike's portrayal of the eccentric Elspeth, who always stole the scene, are worthy of respect.In conclusion, Saltburn relentlessly tried to provoke but never had anything to say, thus leaving nothing to be deliciously burned after the long watch - no romance, no class struggle, and no ingenious manipulative scheme for the one presented was more often blunt and rehearsed than anything else. For those watching, savour well Oliver's last dance, for it seems to me that such will be our fond memory of Saltburn. And of that, I shall not complain. 0.07141812865497077\n",

The only mood it created for me was one of boredom, and in the end I had to play the latter half of it on 2x speed. There's something lacking in the protagonists storyline that I could only imagine might be missing due to the irony of the writer and director, Emerald Fennell, being the very privately educated and somewhat clueless upper-class type that she seeks to ridicule.

If they had not been in it, the rating would have been lower. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Both actors are pretty boring to warch, not skilled actors and the storylines have enormous holes in them. The last part of the film isn't even believable.

      "'' Saltburn '' is a movie about an Oxford University student from a simigly poor background who is invited to stay at his aristocratic friend's place for the summer.The movie is a dark academia story that takes a lot from the '' The Talented Mr. Ripley '', which I appreciated a lot, as I was thinking that it will be another film about rich people indulging into their every whim and fancy. So, the twist was most welcomed, as we see Ollie gaslighting and manipulating everyone around him, going deeper and deeper into his dark obsession. However, the film makers took it a bit too far when it came to shocking the audience and having the message cross through, as some of them were simply gross not socking and they really didn't add anything special to the story.The story itself was enjoyable, moreover, but the film tended to present everything in montage, hence it lost its momentum.Still, the performances were great, Rosamund Pike simply hillarious, and the cinematography impressive. 0.16845238095238096\n",

First time meeting the family made me hope for something interesting. But it wasn't - AT ALL. Just typical modern no-film content for a generation that is used to watching 10-secons-tidbits on Tiktok.Implausible to the highest degree, this is just another confirmation that the rich need to be rid of their riches, because otherwise people such as this rich jeweller's daughter will produce more of such nonsense.

      "The film \"saltburn\" was rather strange indeed. Sometimes it was just boring, disgusting or weird. You couldn't really follow the plot. It was too long for what was intended to be told. The hour of summer holidays at the estate told nearly nothing. It was all in all very alternative with loads of art. Not a family film nor a film for young people under 18. It has the same art-iness like \"French Dispatch\" -but that one tries to tell a story at least. Only good thing about this film might be the actors. Richard E. Grant is doing great there. Jacob Elordi was nominated with BAFTA. But it didn't win any other awards from what I know. Strangely made film. Not something you actually want to watch on a weekend.

      "SPOILERS********************************I loved the film up to around 1 hrs 25, APART from the horrible way Farleigh's assault was portrayed (it felt like the filmmaker was framing it as at least somewhat alluring or exciting? Ugh).The last 40 minutes or so turned the film from a possible favourite into a massive dissapointment. Up to this point It was an intense psychological coming of age thriller that had me enthralled. The last act was so incredibly lazy. It honestly felt like I was watching the ending of a different film. It lacked all nuance and completely undermined the social and political commentary made up until that point.I wish the film had a quiet, emotional ending. The reveal about Ollie's background, his constant lies and manipulation, and the disintegration of an intense relationship, was more than enough for a resolution.Doing a 'and they all died in the end' is just the worst possible thing, what were they thinking?!Side note-Rosamund Pike is a force, she was fecking brilliant. 0.03933333333333333\n",

I continued to watch even though i started to think the movie was getting a bit weird. As soon as the vampire scene happened, i switched it off.

At first I wondered why she filmed it so dark then I though it was very derivative of class divide from 100 years previously then I thought it was an excellent exploration of mental health - originally thinking Felix at his death had felt he was the victim and without us knowing had mental health / suicidal issues triggered from being so lied to and let down after his attempts at control - coupled with Oliver's dysfunctional need to be a single child and be the centre of everything\n",

Directed by Emerald Fennell(who played Midge in Barbie),and produced by Barbie herself Margot Robbie and her husband Tom Ackery,the story follows a quiet man named Oliver Quick(Keoghan) who is struggling to find his place at Oxford University.Things take a turn when he finds himself drawn to Felix Catton(Eldordi),a wealthy young man who's parents(Pike and Grant)are living at an Estate in Saltburn.With Oliver transforming into a psychopath due to his obsession with the Catton family and the estate,will he do something barbaric and take over the estate himself?.This film was very disturbing and hard to follow. There is also some weird scenes including Oliver drinking discharge from Felix's genitals,going on a killing spree and killing all his family one by one and of course Oliver being naked at the end of the film.

The excessive nature of his compulsion is all that makes this comedic, for if wasn't as bizarre as it is, it would be very ordinary in deed.The twist in the tail is somewhat unexpected, if one slips momentarily back into reality, and attempts to rationalise the plot.

They reference Pulp's Common People in the movie but it's really not the flex she thinks it is when she's the one who can call her Dad to stop it all!

And there's a few other 'shocking' moments that were just stupid and thrown in for shock value rather than actually being essential to the plot (the menstrual muff diving, the bathtub, the naked dance to Murder on the Dancefloor). Truly contrived, awful, and cliched. The whole poor white trash, but smarter than smart northerner was a rip of something else. The upper class super rich more money than sense was so contrived and reinforced negative stereotypes rather than sending them up (which I suspect was the attempt) and it was just lazy. -0.1315740740740741\n",
      "I've been seeing a lot of people on social media being traumatized from this film and calling it the weirdest movie ever, and to those I recommend watching any David Lynch movie.

I try to respect everyone's piece of art, because at the end of the day, every movie is people coming together and making art.Barry Keoghan is now getting type-casted in weird psychopathic roles, but it suits him.

      "Hmm, an okay watch but I wouldn't rush to see it again.Too obvious, gratuitous depravity and attempts to be clever that miss the mark. Acting is good though and the ending pulls it together somewhat.I enjoyed the ridiculousness of the classist attitude and Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant deliver their lines wonderfully and with panache. In fact, I rather think they make the film. The other actors are good, but more teenage flick good, think twilight movies with the brooding, slouching with attempted sexiness and knowledge that it's all quite profound.Watch if you have nothing else to put on. 0.31858974358974357\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Emerald Fennell, I love her work. Promising Young Woman is a bit of a masterpiece. However, Saltburn really misses the spot.Saltburn is claimed to be a dark comedy and a psychological thriller. Rosamund Pike's character is the only one with any funny lines and those are few and far between. As for a thriller, there simply isn't anything thrilling about it. It's a series of murders but you always know who did it and why. None of the characters involved ever realise that there is a murderer and never feel at risk. The murderer is never pursued, suspected, or caught. Absolutely nothing thrilling or psychological ever happens.There is a degree of social commentary but it's light touch, infrequent, and about a world few will inhabit or experience. Utterly pointless and nowhere near probing enough to improve the story.Once you get passed the fact there is no story, no comedy, no thrill, you're then left with a collection of disturbing, and frankly weird, scenes that add nothing to the story other than a shock factor that is out of place. The scenes will offend some and probably should carry a warning. One especially is deeply perverted. Exercise caution if easily offended.The only reason for four stars is the acting and visuals. Both are fantastic. There could easily be awards talk about both but the story may well hold them back. 0.05833333333333335\n",

      "Honestly i dont even know where to begin. First off the first 45 minutes of the movie were soooooo boring I felt like dropping this movie by then but i kept watching to see why people like it so much.When i got to the odd scenes (which the word odd doesn't even put into perspective how weird and gross they were) I was grossed out beyond belief and was very confused how most of them even added to the plot because by the end of the movie Barry Keoghan's character had done so many unnecessarily messed up things which had no justification at all by the end. I really felt like there would be some sort of reason for all of his actions and behavior but no he just wanted the mansion they all lived in. Honestly the ending confused me so much that it made me hate the movie even more.In conclusion it's the 2nd worst movie i've ever watched just behind Tenet because at least i understood the dialogue and audio of the movie. The only reason i gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1 was because the acting was actually good and the actors did a great job at portraying their roles. The cinematography was also great but theres no other good thing to mention about the movie. 0.018184523809523814\n",
      "This film is a remake of a film called 'The Talented Mr Ripley.'Ripley's an excellent film, so this one isn't entirely without merit - it's just that if you've already seen Ripley, there's not much point in watching an inferior remake.This is going to happen more and more often - taking the beats and plot points of old films and reproducing them in a modern setting. Much of the marketing for a film like this is via Tik Tok with sequences set to (eg) 'Murder On The Dancefloor,' or putting in OTT scenes that get \"buzz\" on social media - and as most of the target audience won't have seen the original film - it won't matter to them that it's a remake. 0.33402777777777776\n",

      "Geez, reading some of these reviews makes me feel sad for some people that they couldn't enjoy this movie.First, I should state that I read the book. The movie adaptation stays pretty close to the book, and definite captures the tone and structure.Second, what the heck is wrong with this being lighthearted? No, it was not meant to be a poster of what bullying is always like. I saw comments along the lines of, \"I was bullied and this is crap bc it's so much worse.\" Please don't compare your experience to this fictional movie/book. It is not meant to be a representation of bullies and the bullying experience everywhere.Third, if you found this shallow or thought it was just meant to talk about bullying you're just plain wrong. Several characters were deeply developed and multi-dimensional. Not one character is perfect (although Summer comes pretty close).Fourth, the point you missed. This story is about a family that struggles with their own personal things as well as an issue with one family member that affects them all in different ways. The friendship storylines are similar. The point of this book (and it was definitely written for younger audiences, that should be noted), is to give kids a broad overview of how bullying affects others and ways they can combat it. I love that the ending raises Auggie up: the point is how a family can support one another and how that can create resilience in a child and then how the larger community can work together (and in some instances, confront and change) to cheer one another on. Is this idealistic? YES. Is it meant to be, to teach and illustrate a lesson on how things can be if we work together, first in our own homes and then in our communities? YES.One final note, because I see people do this over and over again now with movies and literature. To the person who said something along the lines of, \"it's so hypocritical that we're supposed to be rooting for people to not judge Auggie and then he judges people by their shoes.\" Did you just need to feel offended and self-righteous? My gosh. This is real. awe all judge people, if Auggie didn't, who himself is constantly judged, then how would he be relatable at all? The author (and the movie) go on to challenge these assumptions. The \"hand-me-down\" kid is a friend, then messes up, then tries to make it right. The \"crazy\" girl consistently pushes back against the bullying in a way that many kids do (it's less confrontational and more socially acceptable); that's real. And the \"trust fund\" kid continuously pushes his privilege around in often mean ways, that we all sometimes do without thinking. There had to be a bully somewhere for the story to even unfold, right? And turns out his mom does the same: back to the point of it starting at home.Okay, I'm done being annoyed with humanity now. <3Just enjoy the movie and use it to teach your kids to support one another in the home and stand up for what's right when they're not home. 0.04523809523809525\n",

      "First of all, I gotta say that I read the book. I absolutely loved the book. Now, I wasn't going to raise my expectations for the movie adaptation because we all know how movies disappoint in comparison to the book. Wonder however, stays true to the book, which is its major redeeming point. I thought it would be some modified, really boring movie that would make me sigh throughout the whole 2 hours as I pointed out key flaws and differences between the movie and book (because I'm one of those people), but I loved it. The acting was INCREDIBLE, the story stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot points rather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience. When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said they had cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only person who felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall there wasn't one bad actor.

      "Here's the thing - the film is asking you to see the real person inside, to offer kindness because 'everyone's fighting a battle'.Yet, as soon as Auggie is introduced to fellow classmates, his overly-cutesy narration goes \"you can tell a lot about people by their shoes\". Camera pans down. \"The trust fund kid. The hand-me- down kid. The crazy one\" (cut to clip of the girl being attention seeking, as if to reinforce Auggie's assumptions). The audience is supposed to lol along.How is this fair? Immediately Auggie is stereotyping kids before they've even spoken, something he himself is plagued by.Similarly, it then introduces one bully after another, always 'curing' the first bully (with a message of \"hey - with a bit of kindness, even bullies turn happy and become your best friend!\") before moving onto the next. Of course, despite all this \"see the real person inside\" malarky, the film can't help but introduce some 'super-bullies' (older 7th graders!) who the kids delight in beating up as they 'bond' as new found friends.Then, Auggie receives a recognition prize despite all the other kids being the ones who help him - often having to fight against his negative expectations and assumptions of their agenda.Its very confused and jarring in its messages. Wonder is absolutely your 'safe' family film where everyone bumbles along to happy- plinky-plonky piano music, and any problems are soon solved with a hug. It takes place in an ideal world where anxieties, insecurities, bullies, and all complex human issues are solved via simplistic and contrived 'fixes' (normally involving hugs).I would like to say this doesn't matter because kids and families just want light entertainment - but I think it really does matter. Films have so much more power to inspire and share human truths and complexities, there's no real point in just passing the time with something so shallow. 0.1404920169436299\n",
      "Firstly, I know there are some people with real facial disfigurements who are upset that the child wasn't played by someone with a real facial disfigurement, I can understand why. But as I have unilateral cleft palate myself which is similar, and that I have faced much discrimination throughout life, I feel that it was appropriate to cast a non disfigured child for the role. Why?As unlike a child actor without disfigurement, he wouldn't be able to clean the movie makeup off afterwards. Therefore other kids and even adults in the real world would assume that the young actor is still in character, and bullied even more for it. The movie would only enforce the focus even more on his real life disfigurement in the real world and less on the young actor who played him. Therefore I feel that it was a wise insightful appropriate move. If it was an adult character then I would question it...Anyway back to the movie.It was...okay. But it didn't nail the true reality. I identified with a few things especially the bullying. But as I suspected this movie would be which is a major problem of what a lot of these kind of movies have, it feels much too sanitised.The kid dealt with it a lot better than I did, a lot better than many do. But maybe it is partly because he has the unrealistic perfect movie parents and idyllic family life, and of course as I also suspected would happen he receives a standing ovation from the whole school at the end and everybody is now his friend. As Gargamel would say \"How sickeningly sweet!\".In the real world quite often the bullying is relentless right to the end where even teachers and head teachers don't do a damn thing, and even victim blame, and that it often continues into adult life with even more discrimination. I know this from hard experiences.Another thing, as somebody else pointed out and I agree, the main character \"Auggie\" started talking about how you can tell someone from their shoes. Trust fund kid, crazy kid, hand-me-down kid.....Why would he judge others on their appearance when he gets similar treatment himself? I realise the narrative is probably there to suggest that everybody can be unfairly stereotyped, but for me in the real world I think we with severe facial disfigurements have learned to be less superficial than that.I for one would like to watch a real hard hitting gritty realistic movie, from childhood through to adulthood where it doesn't have the perfect sanitised happy TV movie ending. Not necessarily a really sad unhappy ending, but at least an ending where it shows that he or she as an adult has learned life's harsh lessons the hard way through the continuing bigotry of others through life. Show the world what many of us still go through.The child actor should again be played by someone who isn't disfigured for real for the reasons I gave, but an adult actor who is more emotionally mature and equipped to deal with the cruel comments in the real world should be played by an actor who is.\"Wonder\" is a sweet movie with good intentions, worth watching the once and it does show a degree of empathy which we need more of these days, but it is still typical TV movie syrupy and sanitised melodrama stuff, that isn't near realistic enough. I hope one day it might inspire a more insightful educating movie and portray the true harsh reality of living with facial disfigurements (and maybe even added speech impairment) even if it alarms and shocks people. It would send a more powerful message and that would be a good thing.5/10 0.15519936890418817\n",
      "\"Wonder\" is a touching story about August \"Auggie\" Pullman who is born with a genetic disorder that required numerous surgeries to enable to him to function, not to mention is facial disfigurement.Auggie is a sweet boy who has a loving family who don't treat him any differently, especially his mother (beautifully played by Julia Roberts). While he is home-schooled for most of his life, she finally decides that it's time for him to go to school, much to the initial dismay of his father (Owen Wilson) who is fearful about how he might be treated.Auggie also has a loving, but lonely sister, Via (incredible performance by Izabela Vidovic) who adores her brother but finds herself feeling like she's on the sidelines of the family due to the attention her parents give Auggie.Of course, much of the story is about Auggie integrating into school and the challenges he faces, especially socially. While it works very well, we are given some somewhat \"cliched\" characters here. We have the bully who can only make fun of him. We have the sweet girl (Summer) who likes him but is initially afraid to show it, and we have the boy who is a friend but is peer-pressured into hurting Auggie.The triumph of the performances really must go to Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) and Izabela Vidovic. Both of these actors have bright futures ahead of them.The film is touching and it interestingly enough, decides to use much of the story to share the perspectives of the main characters, telling the story from their points of view. While this was a good way to delve into the mindsets of these characters, and give us some depth as far as they are concerned, the movie ends up missing out on a golden opportunity.It seems that most filmmakers these days are trying to tell touching stories without becoming overly sentimental or being bogged down in melodrama. It is a fine line, but when you are afraid of delving deeper, you risk leaving your story too much on the surface.The movie would have been much stronger had they focused on Auggie entirely, and leave the exploration of the other characters to function and grow through their interactions with him. I found myself wanting more Auggie! I wanted deeper situations with his family, his friends, and the trials and tribulations of integrating into a middle school environment. Movies that do this well are movies that audiences end up cheering for.Still, the movie works, for the most part, and it should be a \"must- see\" for anyone who has been bullied or anyone who has been a bully. Most people still don't get how truly terrible and horrific bullying is. 0.1311431623931624\n",

The less you know about it before viewing the more joyous your viewing experience will be, so I'll just say it's one holiday film I hope will become an annual tradition along with the likes of \"It's A Wonderful Life, \"White Christmas,\" and \"A Christmas Story.\" While \"Wonder\" is not specifically meant as a \"Christmas\" or holiday film, it fits the more joyous and kind themes of the holiday season that are supposedly the core reason we even bother to celebrate them. 0.2361111111111111\n",

      "\"Wonder\" is definitely one of the best movies of this year. It is about a boy named August / Auggie, who has facial differences ; he has gone through 27 surgeries since birth. The movie focuses mainly on the time when Auggie is sent to a regular school by his Mom, against Auggie's Dad's wishes. Auggie faces all types of obstacles / problems that an individual experiences among a group of similar-looking people ; being stared / frowned at , being accepted with doubts and suspicions , being bullied. However, Auggie is a tough-minded and intelligent person, and finally manages to gain genuine acceptance by most of his schoolmates and other people in the community.Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie ; he has really given a very fine, artistic and genuine performance as a boy with facial differences / deformities. Owen Wilson has given a decent performance as Auggie's daddy ; however, he has been denied a fair deal because Owen's role is very limited in the movie. Julia Roberts sparkles in the role of Auggie's Mom. Izabella plays the role of Auggie's sister, and she also excels in her role.The director, Mr Chbosky , has done an inspirational work in this movie. He has captured the sweetness and healing effects of feel-good films like this lovable \"Wonder\". Mr Chbosky uses a round-robin chapter style of story-telling ; some segments of the movie are named after certain characters.

I didn't even have a deformity and I was tortured by verbal and physical abuse, and the children were relentless and merciless. Not a single one dared have some empathy for me or tried to talk to me. They'd be more and more cruel everyday, and the school's principal didn't give a damn about my situation either. That's because I was only a nerd! Now imagine what it'd be like for a child with a facial deformity in real life.I know this movie wants to be motivating and wants to spread the message about being yourself and respecting other.

      "I was hoping for something a little more original than a Little House on the Prairie episode. First of all, maybe I missed something, but when the future bully Julian was taking Auggie on a school tour he may have said a few insensitive things, but only because he's a kid, not out of mean spiritedness, yet Auggie makes a know-it-all wisecrack about the mispronunciation of a word by Julian and then Julian turns against him. Can't say I blamed him.And why did his sister have only one friend? Her best friend blows her off and then she is completely a loner? She seems normal and nice enough to have other friends.Julia Robert's characterization of the mother confused me. At first I thought she was dressed liked a sister wife and had her hair in braids because she was a homeschooler. But then she became a little more hip looking as the movie progressed. Why? Because she was no longer a homeschooler, but back out in the real world? And what did Owen Wilson do for a living to be able to afford a place like that in what I assume was Manhattan (maybe Brooklyn?) and pay for private schools. We never find out but I was dying to know because he came off as a bozo.Overall, I don't think Auggie had it so bad at school. I guess that was the message. Everyone has it bad. Pretty depressing. He has one friend, and yet his \"normal\" sister only had one friend also. I don't think he didn't have a lot of friends because of how he looked. He just didn't have the kind of personality to become popular. I liked the boy in \"Mask\" because his schoolmates overlooked his deformities because he had a likeable, friendly, outgoing personality.One last oberservation as trivial as it may be.

      "WONDER is in the vein of MASK and BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE as stories of young boys growing up with the odds against them because of a physical malady. It's sweet and inspiration with another terrific performance by Jacob Trembley (ROOM) as Auggie, a child with Treacher Collins Syndrome, which despite numerous surgeries, leaves him with a face that is less than classically attractive.The cast overall is strong with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as Auggie's parents, and Izabela Vidovic as his sympathetic sister. Daveed Diggs and Mandy Patinkin are solid as his teacher and principal respectively. While not overly sentimental, Director and Co-Writer Stephen Chbosky and his collaborators don't always find the right note or touch with the dialogue. The script (based on R.J. Palacio's novel) feels contrived at times (and the pop culture references are sprinkled in a bit too liberally at time), but the force of the acting ensemble mostly carries it over some unsteady passages. The supporting cast is also progressively thought out which adds to the general uplifting feel of the production.WONDER is imperfect, but it's good to see a movie which can be enjoyed by the whole family. And, who doesn't a little uplift at the movies once in a while? 0.12021221532091098\n",

      "I watched this film with a school group, and while it has a good lesson in it, the lesson feels very forced. The screenwriters seemed to pick out the best quotes from the novel and squeeze as many as them as they could into the screenplay. A lot of the narration was unnecessary, the film tells you what happens instead of showing. The chapter structure seemed unnecessary as well; it was not unusual for a character's chapter to give said character five minutes of screen time at the start, but forget whose chapter it is halfway through. The last forty-five minutes of the movie is Miranda's chapter, but she is only mentioned shortly in the start, barely being developed while the film expects us to sympathize with her. The jokes are dumb, and August's character made me wince. There were a lot of clichés in it as well, but there were some unintentionally funny scenes, such as the scene where Miranda stares into August's window for five minutes creating a hilariously campy shot. I could also add the hilarious group Minecraft session to this list as well. However there was some good cinematography, with nice shots of Coney Island, and Jack blocked behind a statue of an angel to signify his kindness. Overall, the movie is cliché, annoying, and boring. 0.045000000000000005\n",

It touched on every hot topic about raising children without belaboring on any of them. It showed how tough things can be when it's nobody's fault. I cried through most of the movie I recommend you have tissues nearby. It reminded me of the way I felt after watching \"Pay It Forward\" but with a better ending. If you know of any kid who is going through feeling different because of a genetic disorder, disfigurement, disability, etc., this movie shows a great attitude on how to handle bullies and deal with people who cannot see past the obvious. I especially love this movie because it shows that bullies are a minority, very small minority, and standing up to them can set things right if you do it the right way. I highly recommend this as a family movie. 0.2420026455026455\n",
      "I kind of went into this expecting the wrong thing; a more mature film, for adults but about kids; instead it was a mature film for kids about kids. I kind of got concerned about that when all of the trailers going into it were for other kids' movies; then when Wonder itself got going, I got the feel quickly that it wasn't for me. That was a bit of a disappointment. Wonder follows a boy with a facial deformity, played by the immensely talented and mature Jacob Tremblay, who excelled in Room and even competently stood out in Book of Henry, though that wasn't his show and the movie wasn't great. He's weaker here; Wonder looks at bullying and conformity in the school system but gets bogged down in children's politics, particularly looking at the other students. Some capable writing here and there, but it gets repetitive. The girl, Via, at one point says that her little brother is the sun and other family members, including herself, are orbiting planets. A few minutes later, she says her house is the Earth and the son is the sun. Seems like we heard this metaphor before. This young actress gives a good performance in a stage play a little later, but as with many films dependent on child actors, the performances are not a strong suit. Trying to compensate, they bring in Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as the parents, who are old enough to be Tremblay's grandparents, and look it.Other things are generic and predictable. A dog dies, the kid gets an award at the end, though it seems at first like they're going down a slightly less predictable path with the kid's friend getting the award. If you're a parent with mature kids, absolutely take them to Wonder. It will be very special to them. If not, you can probably skip it. 0.08584978706929926\n",

      "Too many people now don't understand differences and worse don't make the attempt to learn.The first part is understandable.\"Wonder\" is about August Pullman, a fifth grader who was born with a rare condition that has caused him to have 27 surgeries and always to have been home schooled. Any other kid coming upon Auggie would be confused by his differences.However, the good thing about kids is they usually toattempt learn. Or at least many do, not all, and especially reflective of how they were raised.---When the school year begins, Auggie is ostracized, because fifth grade is a pivotal year and hard. However, eventually Jack--a kid he met on a before school tour--becomes his friend.Auggie still doesn't have smooth sailing (dodge ball, the school picture fiasco) but just knowing he has made one contact is huge. This is symbolized by an image of Auggie in a space suit jumping through the halls--free of anyone's eyes and with pure joy.The two have a falling out at Halloween over something Jack says that Auggie overhears. They do get back together after a girl, Summer, intervenes.Eventually Auggie's courage and perseverance is a \"wonder\" and by the end he earns a school award. Therefore, Wonder is the classic story of a kid \"overcoming.\"It's frustrating that there were ever obstacles in his way, that there is any need to glamorize him overcoming them. However, it does send a message in part about not bullying as well as the one about having a strong heart.---The movie is based on a novel by RJ Palacio and stays pretty true to form.Acting is outstanding, from adults to kids.Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) obviously carries the biggest load and performs admirably.Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts as the mom and dad also have scenes requiring a lot of empathy and yet a lot of restraint.One of my favorite characters was Mr. Browne, played by Daveed Diggs--every kid deserves a teacher like this in their lives.I would recommend this as a family movie all can watch. 0.14413919413919413\n",

      "I went to see this movie this morning on the basis of a very positive review in the local paper. (I'm 66, so without such a review I would have assumed it was best left to children and their parents.) It is a well-made movie. Jacob Tremblay, who plays the cruelly-disfigured boy, is indeed wonderful, and Julia Roberts, who has filmed such a wide variety of roles so well, is not far behind him. Everyone in the movie does a fine job. Owen Wilson's portrayal of the father reminded me of the child dad in the comic strip *Sally Forth*. If that's the modern dad, I can only say we've come a long ways since I was a child.I can't look at this movie as a fifth-grader would; it's been too long for me to remember what it felt like to be 10 years old, and I suspect today's 10 year olds look at things very differently than I and my friends did 55 years ago. If you were ever made fun of at that age because of something that made you different, I suspect that this movie will awaken some of the pain you felt back then, however, no matter how long ago it has been. Most of the children are very cruel, at least until the not very believable end.Children do not have the defense mechanisms that adults learn to shield themselves from others' cruelty, so it really hurts. Part of learning to deflect such cruelty is to hide its effect on us, as Auggie tries to do. I suspect that just buries it somewhere in our subconscious memories so that it can pop out at odd moments for the rest of our lives. A sequel showing Auggie as an adult who has undergone yet more facial surgery and now has a \"normal\" face but still the internal, hidden scars could make for an interesting follow up.This story takes place in the world of the very privileged, the wealthy in New York City who can afford to send their children to expensive prep schools. That adds a dimension to the meanness. These children must all have well-educated parents and come from homes that afford them the best that material life has to offer. (As we see in the case of Miranda, material comfort does not guarantee happiness.) That they are still so mean to Auggie speaks volumes about what a college education does not necessarily provide.We see that especially when we have the misfortune to meet Julian's parents. As cruel as he is to Auggie, we can dismiss it as the actions of a child. When we see that his parents are equally hateful, we cannot dismiss it at all, and can only wonder that Julian is anything less than a monster. (His \"I\"m sorry\" in his last scene does not ring at all true.) It was clever casting to make his father so handsome. All that more striking to see that someone so ugly inside can be hiding behind such an attractive exterior.This left me wondering how much worse life would have been for a child like Auggie who attended a public school in a less-than- prosperous neighborhood. That would have made for a very different movie, I suspect, and one that would have been far more painful to watch.There are all sorts of nits one could pick with the script. The children sometimes speak very maturely for 10 year olds. Miranda's \"backstory\" tries to redeem her, but does not really explain why she goes from being Via's best friend to completely ignoring her. The sudden turn-around of the rest of the student body is also left unexplained.Certainly this is a good movie to take children, who will not worry about such issues, to see. It teaches important lessons. Will they be learned by every child who sees it? That will all depend on the world in which he/she lives after leaving the theater. No movie can make up for prejudice inculcated at home and on the playground. 0.07962460535245348\n",
      "Wonder is the plain white sliced bread of inspirational movies - bland, inoffensive and engineered as a light crowd pleaser, to be forgotten the next day. Its lessons and truths are hardly transformative, except maybe for the young readers who were enraptured by the source novel. We know to be kind, and look past surface flaws and deformities. What is especially disappointing is how watered down this is, instead of truly confronting. To cast and then put Auggie up onto the big screen is to force audiences to go through the same thing that all the Beecher Hope kids do, stare down their new freakish classmate. Yet Jacob Tremblay is a ball of cuteness, and you realise you're only grimacing for a second. The makeup is technically excellent but gives Auggie the appearance of a scrunched up puppy, or a half-amphibian toddler. I've seen scarier mascots for insect repellent. It's a Hollywood disability, sanitised for the movie screen.One of the saving graces of RJ Palacio's novel was its carousel of narrative perspectives, outlining how the other figures of Auggie's life are affected by the gravitational pull of his condition, sucking all the attention away from them. This is valuable insight that these sorts of (usually biographical) stories often ignore; the emotional cost and exhaustion of having to be the bigger and better person every single day, and have even slight lapses be demonised by public eye. Voiceovers reveal the secrets and shame behind their seemingly endless pools of patience and empathy, and in a particularly sweet moment, grandma Pullman sees Violet for who she really is: merely a teenager asked to be older and wiser beyond her years, and who has graciously done so. Sometimes playing favourites isn't so bad.This notion is undermined by the rest of the characterisation, which have an annoying tendency to wave off genuine prejudice for fluffy emotional 'growth'. No antagonist is truly an evil person in this story, only misunderstood souls who just need a kick up the empathy backside. The school setting, far from any semblance of reality, houses the usual cinematic bully figures (leaving nasty notes in lockers and so on), and operates under the absurd premise that sooner or later all these bullies will become best friends due to the sheer perseverance and courage of the victim. Bullies can't just be bullies, they all hide a stirring backstory and a lonely voiceover in their minds. Sorry, but kids can and will do much worse to completely normal peers, and to ignore this and spread some naive, happy-go-lucky attitude is nothing but ignorant. Even the dog is an absolute angel; then again, all dogs are, basically motifs for unconditional love. If you ever need some waterworks for your movie, just kill off a dog. Which is exactly what Chbosky does here, after giving Daisy all of two scenes beforehand, for no apparent reason.What grates me most about Wonder is how it comes off as some mandatory information session about workplace bullying and prejudice, with neat, inoffensive scenarios and big, bold instructions telling you exactly what to do and say. The teachers are barely human beings; they act like overexcited robots mimicking motivational speakers, with just the right snappy catchphrase to perk your day up. Sometimes the curriculum is just an excuse for Chbosky to indulge in mystical bird's eye view shots over time lapses. We get it, he's a social outcast. Wonder insists that this is the way the world should work, and in a magical, fictional utopia, perhaps it does, but in the meantime there's a lot work we need to do. Wonder is the safest movie about a socially-ostracising deformity I've seen in a while, with exactly zero risk involved. Write this any other way, and you're basically a monster. -0.029808649879072408\n",

      "Having just read the book by R.J. Palacio, I was surprised at how closely the film followed the written story's narrative. The film even used the chapter format of the novel by which the principal characters of the story got to insert their version of events as they happened, although that got watered down somewhat in the latter part of the movie. What surprised me watching the movie was how some of the characters like Summer (Millie Davis) and Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs) were revealed as African-American, you would not know that from reading the book. Now that I've seen the film, I have to wonder why that kind of information was left out of the written story.I also had a sense coming out of the book that Auggie Pullman's (Jacob Tremblay) craniofacial deformity was much worse than shown on screen. In the picture he doesn't appear to be someone you would be afraid of to look at or touch as is strongly intimated in the Palacio novel. I guess I was expecting something more on the order of the 'Elephant Man', which now that I think of it, would probably have been a greater burden than the real Auggie Pullman could bear.As a family friendly movie, this is an ideal one for youngsters to learn the value of accepting others as they are without making judgmental decisions based on appearances. Auggie Pullman had all the interests and desires of any 'normal' kid while trying to cope with a physical appearance that invited scorn and derision from those who didn't know better. The annual award bestowed upon Auggie for his 'quiet strength' and for being an inspiration to fellow students was well earned, a testament to the kind of human spirit we should all aspire to. 0.19013888888888889\n",

My favorite part: the story takes narratives from different characters in the movie, which goes more detailed in how something happened, changes in people, and their real personal motives, that therefore develops more meaning into the story. What I regret: they could've gone a bit deeper on explaining characters since there's still time for that. I also recognized a few flaws and plot holes. However, thumbs up for the multi-messages and that special story-telling method. 0.21607142857142858\n",

      "I was with this film until the last ten minutes. I'm not a fan of 'heartwarming' movies as a rule, preferring gritty social realism (i.e grim) but heartwarming has its place. Sing Street is one of my favourite films and that could be described as heartwarming. And so I was enjoying this one too - I was ready for the schmaltz, but didn't really get that until the end. The film and indeed the boy (played superbly by Jacob Tremblay (Room) by the way) needed some form of closure - a happy end of you will - but did he really need to win an award? He wants to be normal right? I'm sure there were many people watching in tears at the end, but for me it kinda spoilt the film and changed my score from a 7 to a 6.

      "I saw \"Wonder\", starring Owen Wilson-the Zoolander movies, the Night at the Museum movies; Julia Roberts-Mother's Day, Eat Pray Love; Jacob Tremblay-Before I Wake, Room and Izabela Vidovic-The Fosters_tv, About A Boy_tv. This is a family movie with a message of tolerance and acceptance for those that may look different from themselves. It's based on a book by R J Palacio about a boy that was born with Treacher Collins Syndrome, a facial disorder. Owen and Julia are the parents of Jacob and Izabela. Jacob has TCS and has had multiple surgeries for it but also understands how people can react to seeing his face for the first time. Because of this, he has been home schooled by Julia. Now, Julia and Owen decide that it is time that Jacob started going to regular school-5th grade middle school-and try to lead a more normal life with other kids, at least as normal as he possibly can. There are different reactions from the kids; some curious and some veer more towards bullying. Some, in ignorance, even think Jacob is contagious and that they will catch TCS if they so much as touch him. There are kids that do become friends with Jacob, despite their peer pressure and their single-minded parents. Izabela, who loves her brother very much, also has to deal with feeling neglected, since her parents spend so much time on Jacob. The movie has a message of tolerance, understanding and even acceptance of people that look different. It's rated \"PG\" for language and some bullying and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-maybe for the grand-kids-but I did enjoy this heart-warming family movie and it would be a good rental. 0.1493181818181818\n",

The plot of the movie is very interesting and the direction which was made by Stephen Chbosky, it was very good and he succeeded on making us understand what the boy was being through. The interpretation of Jacob Tremblay who played as Auggie was simply outstanding and I believe that he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Julia Roberts who played as Isabel, Owen Wilson who played as Nate and Izabela Vidovic who played as Via.

      "This is a film for everyone. Let me rephrase that. If you are disabled, have a family member who is disabled, mentor someone who is disabled, are friends with someone who is disabled, or have ever had any deep connection with someone who is disabled, you must see this film immediately. It will change the way you view life, society, and especially how we treat those different from us.The acting is phenomenal. Jacob Tremblay had already been in Room, and was great there as well. But his performance here as Auggie blows it out of the water! I'm so happy his career took off, as he deserves every bit of it. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson give spectacular performances as Auggie's parents, with Roberts' strong will and determination, so characteristic of her, making itself prevalent once more. Wilson, in particular, gives, in my opinion, the best performance I have ever seen from him. He is admittedly the comic relief, always getting a laugh with his signature charm in nearly every scene he's in. But the sensitive side of his character worms its way out in two marvelous scenes. The first is very brief, but as someone who has lost a pet as well, seeing Wilson sitting alone at the dining table with his dog's collar in his hand, sobbing, was particularly heart-wrenching. The other is incidentally the second-to-last scene in the film, with Wilson's character Nate proclaiming the love he has for his son, especially the face he once felt he was cursed with.The supporting cast is excellent as well. Mandy Patinkin gives a puppy-like presence in every scene he's in, easily making my top 10 list for best fictional principals. Noah Jupe and Millie Davis are perfect as Auggie's friends, and Bryce Gheisar as the bully Julian was jaw-droppingly twisted and punchable in a stunningly tragic role, as his comeuppance also reveals the twisted cycle of ignorance and callousness originating from his parents. And in a shock to me, the filmmakers completely turn his entire character around in 30 seconds.But by far, my favorite performance is Izabela Vidovic's Via, Auggie's older sister. I have not seen such a powerful performance from an actress gone so unappreciated since Anna Chlumsky in My Girl. Vidovic had one major credit to her name before this, and it was in a Statham rip-off of Taken. Talk about a step up! For example, in a scene that came out of nowhere, Via is playing the lead in Our Town, reciting a monologue that has little to do with the overall story, and it had me on the verge of tears. Let me repeat that. A monologue, by a character, played by an actual character, that had almost nothing to do with the overall story, made me want to cry. The fact that this film received no acting nominations from the Academy is baffling. I am begging Hollywood to give this woman the career she utterly deserves!The writing of the film is also simply masterful. Told in chapters based on which character the narrative follows, it gives the viewer so many perspectives into the lives of the people affected by Auggie's mere existence. And it is brilliantly brought to life by writer-director Stephen Chbosky.I have no clue why or how people could call this \"manipulative.\" It is sincere, honest, and one of the best films of the 2010s.

      "\"The Elephant Man\" was a popular stage play produced in 1977, which was effectively turned into a successful film in 1980. \"Wonder\" draws upon a successful children's story with a decidedly compassionate view about a child with a physical deformity.The DVD version of \"Wonder\" includes a commentary track that is extremely revealing about the film. The speakers include the film's director Stephen Chbosky and the author of the novel, Raquel Jaramillo, who writes under the pen name of R. J. Palacio. Both Chbosky and Palacio simply gush emotion, as they describe the endless sea of sentimentality in this motion picture.The favorite scene in the film for the director was the \"Our Town\" sequence in which Olivia, the sister of the main character Auggie, assumes the role of Emily when her best friend declines to go on stage and turns the performance duties over to her understudy because her family members are in the audience. The entire \"Our Town\" segment was the best part of the film, bringing together the two friends who had had a falling out, as well as the mother and daughter. Everything came together in that scene, including script, performances, and cinematography.Thornton Wilder's classic play \"Our Town\" is simply filled sentimental lines, which are in keeping with the \"precepts\" that fill up the dialogue in \"Wonder.\" A kind teacher at Auggie's school begins each class with a precept, such as \"When given the choice between being right and kind, BE KIND!\" or \"Your deeds are your monuments!\"The precepts carry over into the family life of Auggie, Olivia, Isabel, and Nate. For his first day in school in which he must confront bullies, Augie is given the advice of his mother that \"when someone acts small, you just have to be a big person!\"It is fitting that when Augie is given a humanitarian award at school, the principal quotes from Henry Ward Beecher that \"Greatness comes not in being strong, but in the right use of strength\" which will \"carry up hearts by the attraction of his own!\"With so many thundering emotional taglines, by the end of the film, the audience is swimming in bathos. Despite the fact that the narrative, especially the school sequences, had no bearing on the true nature of bullying, the hearts of the filmmakers were in the right place in offering the wish-fulfillment experience of what a truly caring family, school, or nation might be like when we treat one another with compassion.

      "《Wonder》 is a movie about how we see people.It may be part of our human nature to discriminate people. An adult may not say it explicitly, but since being a child, we used to judge others.Augi, the hero in the movie, was judged by other 5th-grade children since the beginning of the school, because of his born ugly face. Augi, is not a normal child, he is born ugly in his face. The life for he is hard, and he knew it. He rejected to go to the school and was all the time being home-schooled until his 5th grade. He made a brave decision that he would try the public school.The story line is about facing discrimination, overcoming school challenges, making friends and changing people. I love this story. It is touching. Everyone in the movie is lovely. People learn to take care of each other although life has thrown problem to everyone.The story of wonder is telling us a wonder happened in our society. It is a wonder because people can always choose their attitude towards others, and this makes up for our society. As the dean of the school said in the ending: \"Be Kind, as everyone has its battle.\"This movie reminds me a fight between one of my old friend and me. He always likes to argue about being right. Now, our friendship has broken thanks due to our debate on righteous. After the movie, I wrote to him with a quote said by the girl named Summer: \"When choosing between being right and being kind, choose to be kind.\"Yes, choose Kindness, it will always shift our perspective on how we see others.

There are many different stories and perspectives told, and it really makes the characters shine. There were many moments where I cried or got emotional, due to the sheer honesty and emotion in this movie.The one complaint I have with this movie is that some characters, such as Summer and Charlotte, got left out of the narrative.

      "Some internet posters objected to the casting of a non-facially deformed actor to play the part of Auggie Pullman, the 10-year-old who suffers from Treacher Collins Syndrome, a genetic disorder.I question their assertions that there was a large enough pool of child actors with this particular facial deformity director Stephen Chbosky could have chosen from. And even if there were, there was no guarantee the right kid would have emerged to perfectly fit the part.The strength of Wonder is in the casting of the child actors here. Jacob Tremblay does quite well as Auggie who was fitted with a prosthetic face for each scene he was called on to act in.Julia Roberts plays Auggie's mom, Isabel, who has homeschooled him until the decision is made in conjunction with dad Nate (Owen Wilson) that he's ready to attend a regular private school on his own.The subplot here involves the older sister Via (Izabela Vidovic), a pretty teenager who grows up introverted due to the parents paying much more attention to her special needs younger brother.The break into the second act occurs when the parents bring Auggie to school where he is forced to interact with his fellow students who ostracize him due to his perceived \"ugly\" appearance.Finally, Auggie is befriended by Jack Will (Noah Jupe) who at the midpoint undermines the friendship while all the kids are wearing Halloween costumes. Auggie overhears Jack saying he would kill himself if he looked like him. Later there is a heartfelt scene of reconciliation between the two.Julian (Bryce Gheisar) ends up as Auggie's nemesis, engaging in bullying tactics which escalate in a subtle way. Eventually Jack gets into a physical encounter with Julian over his incessant bullying of Auggie.There's a chilling scene in which principal Tushman (wonderfully played by Mandy Patinkin) meets with Julian and his parents to discuss his punishment for bullying Auggie. I say chilling because we realize it's Julian's mom who is at the root of her son's bullying behavior (it's almost shocking how she demands Auggie be removed from the school after she insists, he's \"traumatized\" the so-called \"normal\" kids).The dark moment at the end of the second act occurs when Jack and Auggie are attacked by older bullying 7th graders and are saved by some of their now redeemed former bullying classmates.Both Roberts and Wilson are saddled with completely forgettable parts as the caring parents.The subplot involving the older sister takes an unconvincing turn when her best friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell) stops talking to her. I got the part that she was troubled due to her parents' divorce but that whole story about pretending she had a brother like Auggie at the summer camp and fearing the tall tale would get out hardly seemed like a good enough reason to stop\n",
      "talking to her best friend.Oh yes, Via also gains confidence by joining the theater club and taking on a new boyfriend. Her road to self-confidence is also chronicled as it must be emphasized that she initially suffered \"collateral damage\" with the parents focusing all their efforts in assisting the younger brother and his attendant disabilities.Wonder offers up a \"feel good\" ending with Auggie winning an award for strength and courage as he receives a thunderous ovation from his fellow students. Tolerance is the film's important message along with its cautionary tale about the evils of bullying. 0.07943722943722946\n",

      "Wonder is movie that deals with the perspectives of characters that revolve around August \"Auggie\" Pullman like planets in a solar system and how their lives are not only linked with the protagonist but provides the scope of self -introspection amongst themselves. Auggie is a wonder kid who is a diagnosed with Treacher Collins syndrome,a genetic disorder characterized by deformities of the ears, eyes, cheekbones and chin with potential complications leading to breathing problems, blind vision, cleft palate, and hearing loss. He was home-schooled by his mother Isabel till Grade 5 and the story primarily is devoted to his experiences in being a part of the normal middle school life.With that being the central pivot, the movie also focuses on his elder sister Olivia who many times is sidelined due to the attention and care Auggie receives and how situations test her relationship with her friends and her family.The biggest success of Wonder is its light-hearted humor and its emotional moments that are executed brilliantly. The emotional sequences resonates particularly well and is not done over the top. Though the strenght of the film relies on the hypothetical setting of an understanding family for Auggie, it might also remain as a slight aberrant from reality considering the fact in real-life the moments are going to much more tense and a calm composure as espoused by the movie may not possible every now and then.The actors have done a fantastic job, starting from Jacob Tremblay as Auggie, to the ever-talented Julia Roberts as the mother, Owen Wilson as the father, Izabela Vidovic as Olvia the sister and the everyone else starting from Auggie's schoolmates to Olivia' best friend and boyfriend. Each cast member brings in the perfect proportion of emotion palette to the celluloid that the entire proceedings does not boring even for a moment. The only drawback was with Owen Wilson being cast as Julia Roberts' husband as he at times looks like her son.Auggie's story does a familiar template especially with the school episodes and eventually the climax where he is felicitated for his achievements. The character development is something we have observed earlier but what makes it different is the acting and the presentation. I, however liked Olvia's story much more, especially her relationship with her boyfriend Justin and her best friend Miranda and how she often-times felt lonely at home and still remained understanding. Olivia character emotes the raw emotions of longing and frustration perfectly and it is a character that will leave a big impression on the audience even after the movie is over.To be honest, Olivia's story will make me more teary-eyed than Auggie's story and there are several instances of that in the film.I have limited knowledge on the Treacher Collins Syndrome and am no expert to comment on whether the film's portrayal has been true or not. However, as an audience who wanted to enjoy a good emotional family drama, I must say Wonder surprised me beyond expectations .Catch this movie and you will not be left disappointed and there is a chance you might have a stronger set of feelings towards your family. 0.20687677102771443\n",
      "This is best for kids, especially ones experiencing troubles in school, family, with friends. It is inspirational, teaching, but in amateur way. It simply gives us insight into other people's problems which are all unique but also common. Bit too subjective focusing on such stuff as character, relationship, feelings, believes. But too ordinary. I expected something more extreme like intervention of doctors, specific person from family or friend, and more action and brutality. Meaning if this was just bit less drama and more action and other genres like thriller. Good that unlike in most movies kids are actors, and they did good job, all look realistic, and everything looks like typical childhood school days. Could be more deep and more extreme and more objective. Emotional, but only barely on multiple occasions. Not good for those not liking subjective and negative movies, or for those who do not like kids. 0.13217592592592595\n",

Jacob tremblays face was perfect and the romance,comedy and reactions people had to Auggie were all genuine reactions.the only thing that bugged me was how much was left and yes,I know there are about 310 pages in this book but so much could have been adapted,such as the pullman's getting a new dog called bear or talking more about auggies three best friends,Christopher,Zachary and Alex but it's just a minor issue. besides that this film is a great and must-see movie. 0.2721074380165289\n",

      "Let me preface this by saying I did not have high expectations for this film. I went in to the theater expecting to see a mostly faithful to the book, kind of charming, 8/10 family movie. This is not what I received. What I got was far worse. Now this is definitely not the worst movie I've seen, not by a long shot. But I think that it is just so unfaithful to the book to the point where it completely missed the main conflict and emotional moments in favor of Apple product placement and Minecraft.There are some thing I thought it did right, for example when Jack realizes Auggie heard what he said to Julian. I thought the editing and cinematography in that moment was very good. Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good on this one.My main problems were the acting (particularly the child acting,) and the writing. The lines for the kids are just things no kid would ever say. It could work if the kids delivery was perfect, but it isn't.Now for my final, and main problem with the movie. How unfaithful it is to the book. There are so many things they did wrong I can't grasp all of them, but I certainly will try. 1. Summer. Summer's character is completely ruined. They get rid of so much of her she no longer has a personality. 2. Daisy. When Daisy dies we don't care at all. In the book they establish how Daisy always is there for Auggie no matter what which is why it's such a big deal when she dies. In the movie you barley remembered she's there until she dies, and the family moves on in one scene. 3. The side characters (Particularly the dad, Amos, and Charlotte.) They dumb them down to such a level that they resemble the original characters in name only. The dad (Owen Wilson) Doesn't act. Amos (Ty Consiglio) barley has a personality, and has almost no impact. And Charlotte (Elle McKinnon) is completely changed and, honestly, an obnoxious character.So those are my problems with Wonder. It's not the worst movie ever, and it does do some things right. But it is so unfaithful in an attempt to modernize the book, and cram it in to a 2 hour run time it loses the original charm and message. 0.04040200138026226\n",

      "Wonder is a movie that tell a well know story of it's not who you are on the outside, but who you are on the inside that matters. But it also points out that while you shouldn't judge a book by its cover; you can't ignore or run from the cover either. Who you are on the inside is affected by the outside and can boil over into sometimes painful and sometime beautiful circumstances.The movie starts with voice over exposition, which could have been done better, but the end product achieves its goal. It beings with a whimsical tone, with the boy August (Auggie) stating that he is a ordinary boy who loves star wars and minecraft. Wearing a astronaut helmet throughout the opening scene, it is removed to shown that Auggie has severe facial deformities. With Auggie going to school for the first time in the fall, he (or more accurately, his father is nervous) and rightly so. The first act sets the table for a story of bullying, but as the second act comes, it turns into so much more. With a black screen and a characters name in script, the perspective shifts. The film explores the affect on others when one person who for better or worse gets far more attention than them. This is rightly noticed, and calls Auggie the Sun for the others are just orbiting around him. How this then affects those in the orbit is the strongest aspect of the film. The film portrayal of emotional conflict of other characters around Auggie is done very well. Auggies face gives him by default special attention and that can cause jealous among others and frustration for Auggie. In the being voice over, Auggie states that he is just a ordinary kid, but as the film nears its end, he and those around him see that is not ordinary. And then, by extension, neither are the lives of those close to him ordinary. But that is not always a inherently bad thing.That is overall biggest issue with this movie is not the underline message but the shifting style or tone. From whimsical to an emotional relationship drama to a strange fight scene near the end. (Why the fight was needed instead of finishing some relationships arcs is beyond me.) The drama portion was by far the most prevalent portion of the film and easily the best. But the changes make the film slightly uneven and push you out of your immersion. Or out of the its orbit if you will.But a slight turbulence in taking off and land is no reason to complain. Wonder is a movie that while it's flying you to high places, it's also taking you right into the heart of the matter in an authentic and meaningful manner. And the human heart and its interactions and relationships with others are a very meaningful thing to explore. It's where we all live, after all.Also there's Owen Wilson, WOW",

      "Although this movie was extremely emotional, and the acting was top form from the whole cast, I was expecting something major to happen. The tempo that is set right from the beginning, doesn't really change but I still found it entertaining, and well written. It's based on a young boy called Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) who is born with a facial difference, which has prevented him to go to school. His loving mother Isabel (Julia Roberts) teaches him at home but she decides to enter him into the local school in the 5th grade. His father, Nate (Owen Wilson) doesn't think that it's a good idea, because he hasn't been around other kids, and he doesn't have any friends but he knows deep down that it would make or break him. At first, Auggie struggles at school with the other kids, and he feels that everyone is talking about him behind his back but he soon befriends his classmate, Jack (Noah Jupe), who helps him tackle the class bully, Julian (Bryce Gheisar). While Auggie is struggling with school life, his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), is also having problems at college but when she joins the drama class, she becomes close friends with another student, who eventually becomes her boyfriend. After a while, the students get used to Auggie's facial difference, and after a couple of episodes, he becomes close friends with the kids who used to bully him. It's a touching story, which proves that it's really what's inside a person, that really matters, and the fact that it's about a little kid who has a heart of gold, really does pull at the heart strings. Julia Roberts was great as the doting mum, and the chemistry between her and Owen Wilson was realistic. With that aside, it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again, and you do have to be in the right mood to watch it but it's still worth a watch and I'm sure that audiences will feel entertained. Watchable!Round-Up:\n",
      "This movie was directed by Stephen Chbosky, who also brought you the Perks of Being a Wallflower. He certainly got the best out of the cast, especially Jacob Tremblay who also starred in Room, alongside Brie Larson. For such a young age, 11 to be precise, he certainly put a lot of adults to shame but the storyline felt like there was something missing. As it was made from a book, I can understand that the director was trying to stay true to the original story but it would have been good to see a twist at some point. Anyway, I enjoyed the film and I would highly recommend it to people who like there emotional movies but don't expect the tempo to change.Budget: $20million\n",

I'm shocked really, where I am from the boy goes to, plays with, and interacts with his peers from the get go. This creates acceptance that we are different. And gives the boy( whom, if would have walked the streets here, you would not think twice about) confidence. There was like nothing wrong. He behaved like a kid his age, liked the stuff kids like, he would definitely get flack for being smart though. I was flabbergasted that there are people that act like this.

      "This movie is an attempt to give you two hours of uplift. It is the story of August Pullman as he enters school for the first time in his life in the fifth grade. The reason he is entering school in the fifth grade is that his mother has home schooled him until 5th grade. The reason for him being home schooled, is that he was born with a deformed face and his parents were afraid of him having to deal with other children.As the story continues, he suffers through some heartbreak dealing with being around other children and their cruel comments. \n",
      "Eventually he adjusts and develops a series of friends and we get an unexplained and somewhat unrealistic but very positive ending. The movie also brings up Precepts and their value in life.One of the Precepts:\"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.\"\n",

      "I have watched Wonder in the Student United Building at the University of New Mexico for 2 dollars, I have heard that the movies were good and it is nominated for OSCAR, Jacob Termbly, who also played Jack in the Oscar-winning movie Room, played the leading part. Wonder is based on a book that has the same, it tells a story about August, he is like any ten years old kid who loves space stuff, eats a lot of ice cream, plays Video Games, loves Halloween costume and a Star Wars fan but, he is not like the other ten years old kids, August has a medical condition that affected his face since he was born, he wears an astronaut space hamlet to cover his face, the kid has been having several surgeries since he was a baby, the movies also describes the struggle that his family, especially his mother, is going through both psychological and physical ways. August did not go to school like the other kids his mother has been homeschooling him since first grade school but, now she thinks that his ready to go to a middle school. Wonder it is kind of similar to the movie \"Elephant Man\" it talks about not to judge people based on the way they look and how to prepare an unusual kid for the outside world. When he goes to school other kids assumed that he does not know anything about school or school supplies that one of them told him\"this is an eraser\". For a movie that has been based on a book, Wonder pretty much sticks to the original story, unlike other movies that were based on books where they change a huge amount of the story so that it can get as much viewer as it can. Although the movie is sending really great massages it sometimes conflicts with these messages , Wonder says not to make assumptions to people based on the way they look and yet when August goes to the new school he looks down at student shows because he thinks that you can say a lot from people's shows. In Addition, it says that we should not make fun of people's appearance but, Jack. August's friend makes fun of Julian the bully look The movie could seem not realistic sometimes like, how come that a middle school has only one kid that is been boiled on and been making fun of, also how could a bully become your best friend.\n",
      "The movie does not just focus on August and his mother only it also contains some side stories like his sister and how she feels neglected because all of the attention from her parents is going to her brother beside her problems with her best friends. And, August's friends and the impact he does on their lives.\n",
      "It is hard to say that Wonder is just an emotional sad movie it is more than that, you can shed sad tears from seeing August struggling to make people just accept him and you can laugh tears when Mr.Tushman the school principle introduces himself to August.\n",
      "You can learn a lot from watching Wonder it is such an inspiring movie for kids who struggle to fit in the community and find it hard to get acceptance from their peers it gives them an idea about what to accept from the outside world and what kind of comments and interactions you would get from all kind of people. It also helps the mothers of those kids who are trying to make their children feel normal and loved. In addition, it is a teaching lesson for parents who get busy with their kid who struggle the most and have big issues and forget their other kid like in Auggie's sister. Also when it comes to friendships Wonder shows how friendships can be difficult that sometimes you have to invest in it and work hard to make it work.\n",

A story about a boy with facial deformity where as long as it goes we learn more about how this boy feel internally and how faces the people and how feel about his family.In my opinion this movie is, one from the movies that make you feel how these humans which are different from normal consider and give an option how would be if you was in their condition.I love seeing movies like this.Moreover the perform of actors was Great and especially of Jacob Tremblay.Stephen Chbosky, a non-popular director did a good job here like earlier this year in movie beauty and the beast and in the year of 2012 the awesome movie called The Perks of Being a Wallflower.I really enjoy it and i rommend it with the most love.This movie is a masterpiece and a litlle wonder in the year of 2017!! 0.33208333333333334\n",

It's very interesting and you understand all hero. All people deserve happiness, a person cannot change his appearance and you need to love others, these are the main thoughts of this film.

      "I think that behind the story, behind the characters, and behind the screenplay, there is a thing called hope that in our real life we tend to forget it, and this movie does the best job to make us remind it. The storyline is fantastic, and what I find out amazing about this movie is that you don't see just the life from Auggie's life. Because Auggie has a lot of beautiful people around him, his mother, his sister, his dad. You even get to understand their reactions, as Auggie is a kid and in a environment where children are all around, we know that they tend to have a natural reaction based on the world they have lived in. That is where kids proove that they are more than kids. The bond that Auggie and Jack Will forms, is a bond that puts the base of a friendship in it's purest form.

Wonder is very good and the kid actor does a bomb of a good job. For some reason the more Auggie opens up so dies Mom Julia Roberts go from cardigans and tight buns to hip mom- not sure why.

It was well played out and was genuine a pleasant surprise to watch.There were no cheesy moments, nor the \"oh he looks different, let's make it unrealistic\". This could happen in real life as well. And that is what I liked about this movie. Does not hide the problems, yet not trying to be better than it could be for that situation. \n",

Julia Roberts was also very good and delivers one of her best work in years. A very natural and incredibly down to earth role - but also quite Oscar begging. Still a very good performance. Owen Wilson was even better. He should do more serious roles like that. He perfectly mixed his typical humor with many dramatic scenes. There is particularly one great scene with him towards the end. Izabela Vidovic was the MVP of the film and really had some of the strongest scenes in the film. I liked Mandy Paintkin and out of the other kids in the film Noah Jupe was the most outstanding one.\n",

      "\"Wonder\" (2017) shines with a heartfelt message and endearing performances, earning its 7/10 rating. Jacob Tremblay's portrayal of Auggie is nothing short of remarkable, bringing to life the challenges of a young boy with facial differences. The film's strength lies in its ability to convey the importance of kindness, empathy, and acceptance in a world that often judges by appearances. While the narrative's sentimentality occasionally treads into predictable territory, it's balanced by strong editing and a touching musical score that elevates key moments. \"Wonder\" is a touching reminder of the power of compassion, making it a heartwarming and uplifting experience for those who appreciate its earnest message. 0.19871794871794873\n",
      "Based on R.J. Palacio's best-selling 2012 novel and directed by Stephen Chbosky, \"Wonder\" is about Augie, an eleven-year-old child suffering with the disfiguring effects of Treacher Collins syndrome, and his attempts to fit in at a tony New York prep school. Rejected and mocked at first, the child with the support of his family persists in his attempts to gain the acceptance of his classmates.\"Wonder\" succeeds largely on the talents of the likable young Jacob Tremblay, buried behind elaborate latex prosthetics as Augie, and benefits from a storytelling structure transferred from the novel— individual segments of the story are assigned to characters peripheral to Augie, to explain the motivations and reasons for various actions and interactions involving the boy.Unfortunately, \"Wonder\" doesn't work quite as well during the scenes featuring grownups. Julia Roberts and especially Owen Wilson contribute wonderful performances as Augie's loving and supportive parents, but are never quite persuasive as a family—the scenes set among the children and their friends reduce Wilson and Owens to guest star status in their own movie. Mandy Patinkin also contributes rumpled warmth and crinkle-eyed benevolence as the school's headmaster.While \"Wonder\" looks and feels like a true story, it is not—Palacio's Mark Twain Award-winning novel was in fact inspired by a 1995 pop song by Natalie Merchant, also titled \"Wonder.\" Merchant's song has a lyric which reads, \"Know this child will be gifted/With love, with patience, and with faith,\" a sentiment richly echoed in the film.\"Wonder\"—the movie—has so far been surprisingly successful with critics and audiences alike. Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 84%, based on 68 reviews. And viewers polled by CinemaScore assign \"Wonder\" the rare audience grade of A+.Released to over 3000 theaters across the United States, \"Wonder\" was expected to earn around $9 million during its opening weekend—optimistic when considering that the picture was released simultaneously with the highly-anticipated \"Justice League.\" When \"Wonder\" exceeded the expected weekend gross on opening day alone, the opening expectation was adjusted by experts to something around $28 million.\"Wonder\" is recommended for family audiences. Viewers are encouraged to bring plenty of Kleenex. 0.2894480519480519\n",
      "If there exists a better or more thourough tear-jerking mechanism than this movie I am unaware of it. The question of whether it accurately reflects reality is inconcequential, or if Auggie and his behavior are most perfectly suited to represent what it means to grow up different is not important.\n",
      "In this age of anonymous internet insult flingers, where everyone who tries is raked over the coals and every kindness subjected to ridicule, this simple parable reminds us of the better angels of our nature, at a time it is sorely needed.If you liked \"Pay It Forward\" you'll surely enjoy Wonder 0.31538461538461543\n",
      "I remember when I saw the trailer for this in the cinema, it caught me by surprise I could feel myself welling up, just at the trailer.\n",
      "My GF will not watch this due to the tear factor, so I sat and watched this on my own.\n",
      "It does get you welling up and angry ect, the kid trying to over come his shyness and trying to brave his first time at school with a facial deformity. It handles it all quite well with each of the characters getting little story arcs of their own to show where they all fit in the big picture.\n",
      "Strange why the mother left it till middle school to suddenly send her son into the world, kids are more accepting at a younger age, she should have sent him to nursery then primary that would have stood him in good stead.However he makes friends and becomes for confident and pretty much wins everyone over, it is a standard feel good film and does kick you in the feels. Not a film I'll go back too but appreciated it for what it was. 0.21349999999999997\n",
      "If it wasn't a heart warming story, no one would rate this movie as a 7 or even 8. It seems like people feel obligated to love it for the good cause. But the truth is: it's not well made!

      "When I saw this movie I was glad that the movie had a happy ending because movies where you see people who have facial differences like this like Joseph Merrick from The Elephant Man and Rocky Dennis from Mask they have sad endings but in this case with this movie it has a happy ending and I love films with happy endings and if you haven't seen it I encourage one day that this movie will be on the top on one of the AFI 100 famous movie quote in the future and I have two on what Auggie Pullman said in Wonder and that is \"Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness\" the other is When given the choice between being right and being kind, chose kind. 0.3507142857142857\n",
      "I don't know where to begin, and I'm still in tears writing this so my grammar may not be on point. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but say that you need to watch this show, especially if you have kids as well to let them know that it is 'OKAY' to be different and to respect other people for being that little different, as it would be boring if we were all the same wouldn't it? An emotional movie but a movie that has such a good storyline throughout. I love going back to watch this movie as it's one my favourites.I'm astounded that Rotten Tomatoes hasn't given this a 100% as they normally do for topics as such as this one.Now let's stop reading reviews and see it for yourself.

      "Is it possible to rate a film 7 out of 10 and still give it a bad review? I give this movie 7 stars because it's sensitive subject matter that deserves respect and because the filmmakers successfully hit the cheesy mark they were going for. This movie is about a young boy who struggles with a facial deformity, which affects not only him, but his family and classmates. The subject seemingly has a lot of flavor, but what the filmmakers delivered was a healthy serving of vanilla ice cream. This is a movie that was sentimental, self-righteous, and overly compassionate. All of the information is spoon fed and the viewer is left with no room to come to their own conclusions. To bring home my point, at the end of the movie, Julia Roberts turns to her son and says, \"You really are a wonder.\" The son then goes on stage to accept an award, while all of his classmates applaud him. Appreciators of fine cinema won't like this movie, but the story itself can reach a wide audience. 0.04607843137254903\n",

      "When I watched this movie, I didn't know what it was about. It started great, made me curious and at the right moment it put all the right pieces together to introduce the story of Auggie. Here I was thinking this movie is very brave to touch such a sensitive topic. Later on, when it started switching characters and telling us the story from different standpoints I was like OMG this movie is perfect. At that step it had everything, the directing, the acting, the story telling. Everything made sense. It wasn't just about Auggie the poor boy with his condition, it was about a sacrificing mother, a daughter who's lived her life in the shadows and a father who's pretending to be strong.In the second half of the movie, everything went to the ground. The other POVs (Jack's and Miranda's) weren't as strong a Via's. In fact, they were shallow and hardly added any meaning. I found it surprising that they didn't make a Julian's POV since he's portrayed as a villain and just decided to make him the bad boy with the bad parents.However, the movie really looses its touch when it starts fixing and perfecting everything. All characters make up and renew their friendships, the community (which is a bunch of elementary school students) suddenly becomes supportive and aware of Auggie's condition and he ends up the most popular kid in the school and even wins an undeserved honorary award. The mother miraculously finds time to finish her Master's thesis after not working on it for a few years. The dad well he turns out to be just the dad with no interesting details.Many people have criticized the character of Auggie being uninspiring and selfish. I'll not go that way since he's a kid and I wouldn't go too hard on a kid with his age and condition. The actor (Jacob Tremblay) did a brilliant job though. Other criticism was about the movie weakly handling the idea of bullying and I do agree there. The movie didn't have the courage to do a good job of presenting this issue that's a a sole part of it.This movie had the potential of being great. It handled such a difficult topic in a smart way and had all the elements of being a masterpiece. However, when things got real, movie makers decided to take the short rode which turned this into an unrealistic feel-good movie that thrives to be aspiring but only succeeds at shallowly provoking the emotions of its audience. 0.09154761904761907\n",

The special effects in this movie are a joke, there is a part where kids are joking that Auggie looks like Darth Sidious and then he imagines some guy in a homemade-looking Palpatine costume. The plot is boring. It is just 5th grade, only it's with a kid who looks like a cross between Hillary Clinton and the scared half of Harvey Dent's face.

Julia Roberts was spectacular as the mother. Never going over the top, her face was a dictionary of emotions. Another thing I loved about Wonder was that they cast so many Hallmark movie actors! Ali Leibert was great as a teacher. The real winner was Crystal Lowe as the angry parent of a bad student. She totally played against type! Posties are tickled about how different she was from Rita.

Something predictable which I understand since it is difficult to make a movie that deals with this type of things without a happy ending so it was somewhat predictable.The lead actor is also quite prepared, you can tell he took the script seriously. 0.17424242424242425\n"

      "\"Wonder\" is a new American movie that was released just yesterday here in Germany and the cast includes Oscar winner Julia Roberts, Oscar nominee Owen Wilson, almost-Oscar nominee Jacob Tremblay, Golden Globe nominee Mandy Patinkin (Homeland) and a few other faces that movie buffs will definitely recognize. It runs for 110 minutes roughly and tells us the story of a boy whose face is deformed through a genetic defect and how things go when he visits a public school like everybody else for the first time. The beginning sure is rocky, but things get better soon for sure. I believe one of the film's biggest strengths is that the longer it goes the more it is about everyday struggles for teenagers and there is also great focus on the other younger character as you will see by the intertitles. Interestingly enough, the two parents did not get their own chapters, which shows really that this is about the younger ones and at least as much for the younger ones. It may not be a film for the very little ones, but for everybody else it definitely is. And besides you get enough Roberts and Wilson too, even if they may not be in the center of the action. The director here is Stephen Chbosky and he is also one of the writers and with this film he adds another success to his body of work, certainly really on the rise he is. Minor criticisms go maybe to the final award segment that may have been a touch too feel-good and also to the scene near the end when the young bully all of a sudden realizes how wrong he was which did not feel authentic. But these are just really minor criticisms. It is a pretty touching movie in my opinion, funny at times too, and certainly dramatically relevant from start to finish. A powerful statement on tolerance and friendship and discrimination and with all the compassion for refugees these days we should not forget the ones in the middle of us who at least deserve as much of our emotional support.I think it is good that the film can call itself an Oscar nominee, but honestly the category could not be more wrong as really it is all about the one thing that should not stand in the focus in this movie and honestly with all the films with great make-up who did not get nominated they clearly had the disadvantage because the makeup was just there and not an essential part of the story. I really would have preferred a screenplay nomination. Anyway, better than no nomination I guess and we will see if it has a shot at the win, which I doubt. Now back to the film itself. I want to mention one specific moment I really liked about the script, namely the daughter's female friend who takes her distance all of a sudden and in a bad movie we would have had her try to make out with the boyfriend, but here we have her call Tremblay's character and talk about her feelings, which was one of my favorite scenes. There are many other really high-quality scenes though and this is a film that will suck you completely in at times and it will definitely fly by. Glad to see it is getting a great deal of attention and recognition. Tremblay delivers again and everybody else isn't too shabby either from the cast, but also from the crew. The final outcome is impressive and I applaud everybody who worked on this one in front of and behind the camera. This is a must-see, one of 2018's finest and a film for the whole family. I highly recommend checking it out. Huge thumbs-up from me. 0.18076418951418952\n",

      "I rented this the other night, and I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was. It's a very emotional beautiful sad movie that deals with life, peer pressure, bullying, loss, friendship, and being comfortable with yourself. I might even buy it someday.The movie is about August \"Auggie\" Pullman who is a 10 year old boy with a facial deformity. He's been home-schooled up until now, but his parents want him to start 5th grade and attend real school and make friends. He becomes an outcast, but makes a few friends. Meanwhile, Auggie's sister, Via has started school and her best friend doesn't talk to her anymore, and she feels like her family neglects her.This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions and the perfect way to tell kids that we shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I highly recommend WONDER!!! 0.2741071428571428\n",
      "Not even Julia Roberts could save this turkey- A mere twenty minutes into the film, as I was relieving myself in the restroom, the walls around me shook with strong vibrations from the adjacent screening of Justice League- sadly this was the most exciting event to happen for the next two hours- Wonder was totally underbaked,,, I will say the character development was decent, but many unnecessary scenes ( two high schoolers kissing in the middle of a sidewalk in NYC LOL), uneven pacing, pedestrian script, performances about what you'd expect from child actors- Auggie's sister was the best act in the movie. Good job Auggie's sister- as I watched her monologue during Our Town, I realized that I wish I were watching their play rather than this movie- I totally would have been satisfied if the movie had ended right after this scene, however I peeked at my phone and realized we had another 40 minutes of slogging to go- I could even tell the children in the theater were getting restless from all the filler scenes. All in all, it wasn't terrible movie, perhaps even redbox/netflix worthy- did I feel uplifted with its predictable ending?? Yes, I did- however do I feel satisfied having spent 11 dollars for this viewing- not quite 0.13662698412698412\n",
      "I saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked interesting, not just because of the actors in it, then I saw critic Mark Kermode doing his review of it, being positive, so I definitely wanted to see it, written and directed by Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower). Basically in North River Heights in upper Manhattan, August \"Auggie\" Pullman (Room's Jacob Tremblay) is a fifth-grade boy, he has a rare medical facial deformity called mandibulofacial dysostosis. Auggie has been home-schooled due to numerous surgeries to improve his breathing and facial structure, but he is approaching middle school age, his parents Isabel (Julia Roberts) and Nate (Owen Wilson) decide to enrol him in private school Beecher Prep. At first, Auggie is stared at and ostracized by almost every student, and he is tormented and bullied by some for his disfigurement, but then he is approached by classmate Jack Will (Noah Jupe), and they form a friendship. During Halloween, Auggie intended to dress as Boba Fett, his favourite character from Star Wars, but the dog Daisy threw up on it, so he dresses as Ghostface. Auggie is unrecognised walking around the school and is not tormented incognito, but then he walks into his homeroom and overhears Jack telling bully Julian Albans (Bryce Gheisar) that he is \"only pretending to be friends with Auggie.\" Feeling upset and betrayed, Auggie wants to leave Beecher Prep and got back to home-schooling, but his older sister Olivia, nicknamed \"Via\" (Izabela Vidovic), talks him out of it. Auggie is later approached by classmate Summer (Millie Davis), he tells her about the incident, but swears her to secrecy, Jack notices he has been quiet and distant, Summer gives him the clue \"Ghostface\", he then realises what Auggie heard when dressed up on Halloween. Julian calls Auggie a \"freak\", in anger Jack punches him in the face and they fight, it is broken up by teachers Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs) and Ms. Petosa (Ali Liebert). Jack is suspended for two days and writes a letter of apology to the principal Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin), who understands his reasons, during the winter break Auggie is playing Minecraft, it is there that he and Jack communicate, Jack apologises and asks to be friends again, Auggie accepts. During the rest of the school year, Julian and his group continue to harass Auggie, leaving hurtful notes, then taping a class picture to his locker, with Auggie photoshopped out, Mr. Tushman confronts Julian and his parents, Julian's mother Sarah (Crystal Lowe) proclaims that she edited Auggie out of the photo; she then says that Auggie does not belong there. Despite Mrs. Albans' threats to pull their funding from the school, Tushman suspends Julian for two days, Julian apologizes to Tushman for harassing Auggie as his mother drags him out the door. Meanwhile Via has been ignored by her best friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell), after meeting friendly student Justin (Nadji Jeter) she signs up for Drama Club at her high school, during the process Via and Justin develop a romantic relationship. Later Via is selected to be the understudy for the lead role in the school's production of Our Town, Justin is the lead actor, but Via never told Isabel and Nate the play was coming around, Auggie hears Via and their parents arguing about it. Auggie confronts his mother and sister, they brush it off, he accuses them of lying and storms off to his room, then the dog Daisy starts whimpering, Via rushes up to tell Auggie that Daisy is sick, they say goodbye as Isabel plans to meet at the hospital, it is implied that Daisy was put to sleep. It is the night of the play, lead actress Miranda pretends to fall ill, Via takes her place and gives a performance that earns a standing ovation, after the play, everyone, including Miranda and Justin, go home to the Pullmans to celebrate. During a school trip to a nature reserve, Auggie and Jack are ganged up and threatened by a group of seventh graders from another school, several of their classmates, including Julian, come to their defence. It comes to the Beecher Prep graduation ceremony, Auggie is announced by Tushman as the winner of the Henry Ward Beecher Medal for standing out; everyone applauds Auggie, and Isabel calls him a \"wonder\", he receives a standing ovation. Also starring Emma Tremblay (Jacob's sister) as Michelle and Sonia Braga as Grans. Young talented actor Tremblay shines in another moving performance as the boy with the congenital facial disability, Roberts and Wilson are nice as his parents, and there are great supporting performances from Vidovic, Jupe, Patinkin and others. It is a simple story of the difficulties of growing up, not just for one with a disfigurement, but also for well-adjusted children, it is clever for showing the perspectives of the other characters also, including the almost ignored older sister and the lead character's only friend, it is not just sympathetic, it also has some good laughs, all in all it is a touching and likeable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Very good! 0.17546912271402065\n",
      "Auggie is a young boy with a deformed head and face. His mother has kept him at home until fifth grade, but now they feel it's time to send him off. They choose a private school. As things develop, he is treated horribly, trying to hold up, but extremely sad. One boy in particular bullies him incessantly. Peer pressure rules the day and Auggie gets the brunt of the reactions. He has a sister who has given up her self because her parents have had to put their attention on the little boy who has had countless surgeries. Her story is as tender as his. There is a scene where she is the understudy for Emily in \"Our Town.\" If you can keep a dry eye during that, you're better than I am. These kid actors are awesome and it is totally engaging.

      "Now,Because I gave this 4 out of 10,It does not mean I did not like this movie.I enjoyed it.But,There are a few things that I take issue with throughout the movie.(also,I am a very harsh critic).Firstly,None of the kids in the movie talk like normal children(in 5th grade.)If they were really in 5th grade,burping would not be humorous,and a lot more of the conversation would be focused on more adult Ideas,with a lot more profanity dropped throughout any dialogue.Another thing is where Auggie dresses up like Ghostface for Halloween.It beautifully conveys his emotions when he finds out what Jack Will thinks of him,Making the customary ghostface into the real emotion Auggie feels,But seriously,a 10 year old is not likely to be watching scream.He even mentions that he wore it last year(when he was 9).In fact,they also reference Freddy Krueger with one of Julien's notes to Auggie.What is wrong with all these kids? Why are they watching horror movies at such a young age? Another problem I have with the movie is Julien.The book,(If it had Julien's Chapter)Conveyed problems Julien had,and trouble fitting in.In this one Julien is clearly the villain,which detracts from the experience of the movie.Auggie is one of the only 3-dimensional characters throughout the movie.My final(and biggest)criticism is that everything works out for Auggie in the end.This is completely unrealistic,and the movie ends as if the entire conflict was completely resolved when Auggie won a single award.Life is not like that,and that was one of the harsh realities that made the book so moving.In the movie,everything wraps up perfectly for everyone,and That annoys me.I would have felt a lot more emotion if there was still SOMETHING unresolved.But overall,It was a pretty good movie,and you should watch it if you have time. 0.1830587557603687\n",
      "Despite my headline, I enjoyed this flick. Overly predictable, a little smarmy, but still strong. Kids should see this film. Kids should learn from it. It's far from art, but a good popcorn movie and an important lesson to young folk. 0.23072916666666665\n",
      "It's a beautiful movie with so much heart! Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) is truly a wonder! He portrayed the role perfectly and with so much maturity, it was shocking at times! Noah Jupe (Jack) is the cutest thing! He is a revaluation and a joy to watch! Julia Roberts, as always, manages to bring light to the movies she's in. She just shines, especially in this role where she is a very caring, very \"human\" mom who drops the ball every once and a while. Owen Wilson lightens up the tone just at the right moments.It's a beautiful story, an outstanding cast and just a good overall experience. 0.3532142857142857\n",
      "This is a truly inspiring film, the gripping and saddening story of Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) engages the audience and makes you think how you judge people yourself, take a minute if you saw Auggie what would your initial thoughts be? The film switches between key characters, obviously Auggie, Via (Izabela Vidovic), Jack Will (Noah Jupe), Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell), by showing each key characters background it takes the lime light away from Auggie, not to take anything away from him but the whole film revolves around him as he features in everyone's backstory and own story, the back stories of each character shows the personal trials they are going through, while they are sometimes shared outside of the back story Auggie manages to link everything back to himself, when it is not always because or due to him as Via says: 'not everything's about you Auggie' Via is the caring, protective, understating sister and daughter she is like Auggies guardian outside the comfort of his own house, when Auggie links one of Via's problems back to himself she snaps and says that not everything is about him, this causes Auggie to go into self pitying himself and trying to convince Via that only bad things happen to him, while in his mind this is true because he was home-schooled up until middle school he doesn't know any better, Via diffuses the situations and makes amend by taking Auggie trick or treating as it his favourite thing to do other than Science in which he is a mini Einstein. The moving story of Auggie and his struggles deepens when a fancy dress day a school for Halloween disguises Auggie and he over hears his so called 'bestfriend' Jack Will saying he 'would kill himself' if he looked like Auggie which leads to the break of their friendship, but don't worry not all is lost they make up over Minecraft and become the best of friends once again, their true friendship is seen when some older kids begin to pick on them in the woods on their residential trip, they target Auggie and Jack Will literally fights back, they are soon joined by more boys in their class and they become the victors. This is also seen earlier when Jack Will punches Julian (Bryce Gheisar) for making fun and bullying Auggie. Over this film was an awakening into human kindness and human wickedness. It is a reality check in how we judge and treat others that do not look 'normal'. By the end of the film Auggies space helmet is no longer visible as his dad Nate (Owen Wilson) hides it and begs Auggie not to tell his Mother (Julia Roberts). Go and watch this now!

      "Wonder is my latest review. It is for the most part, a \"wonderful\" movie. Now granted, Wonder is not quite Academy Award-worthy. However, if you like your dramas syrupy sweet and filled with plenty of cinematic saccharine, then Wonder will give you your fix.Wonder is distributed by Lionsgate and is based on a 2015 novel. It's what I like to call, a manipulative tearjerker. Every scene is displayed for maximum effect as you the viewer, loosen up the weepy ducts and reach for that big box of Kleenex.Wonder's story involves one August \"Auggie\" Pullman (played by an unrecognizable Jacob Tremblay). \"Auggie\" was born with a facial deformity and has been home-schooled for most of his young life. After reaching fifth grade, his parental units decide to enroll him in private school so he can experience more human interaction while making new friends.Now does all this sound a little familiar? Well it should. Wonder sort of resembles 1985's Mask (starring Eric Stoltz). In fact, if you look at Wonder from an extent, it almost feels like a combination of Mask and a distant cousin of Forrest Gump (the early years).So yeah, Mask is more accomplished than Wonder. It has more heightened performances (from the likes of Stoltz, Cher, and Sam Elliott), stronger production values in terms of scope, and a deeper characterization of its scarred subject (Roy L. \"Rocky\" Dennis).Still, Wonder is highly recommendable. It's a small, little film with a big, bleeding heart. I liked the unexpectedly good casting of Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as \"Auggie's\" sympathetic (and supportive) parents. I also liked the way director Stephen Chbosky includes fantasy elements (hello Chewbacca), separate narratives involving the flick's adolescent co-stars (\"Auggie's\" best friend, his sister, and his sister's best friend), and an unforced interpretation of bullying. This gives Wonder a level of originality and earnestness not seen in most kid pics.Bottom line: Wonder doesn't always elaborate on what makes \"Auggie\" tick, or how he became so smart, or how he got those birthing marks on his face. Oh well. This vehicle somehow works anyway and every kid and/or parent should see it. In my brief review of 1982's E.T., I remarked, \"if you don't elicit an emotional response while viewing this film, you might as well not be human\". Well that same statement applies to Wonder. Rating: 3 stars. 0.28438054009482583\n",
      "Auggi and her mother are real heros also his dad trying his best for his kid. 0.6\n",
      "The most cruel thing said in the movie was by the sister. \"Not everything is about you.\" Jeezus Christ. But hey we are supposed to play on with the eternal apocalyptic battle between good vs. Evil where the \"evil\" \"mean\" \"bully\" is the bad guy where the kid laughs at the end when volcano malfunctions to trumpet good conquering evil. Ho hum.I actually hated that Via's character. (Nothing against the child actor. Heck she even did a fine job of playing this frustrated, sourpuss girl who seems to hate everything in life and is only concerned about herself -while wink wink- at the same time remembering to couch with love when giving advice to her brother.I GET IT. They wanted to show the dynamic of a caregiver or rather the neglected child too... but the character just came off plain unlikable. Again maybe because of her mean spirited comment.On the other hand, Miranda character was refreshingly 'healthy' in terms of her outlook, mindset and everything.Having said that... I LOVEEEEEE Owen Wilson's character. This guy continues to impress me from the lovable hippiesque JC lovin character in Little Fockers... It is so refreshing to see him in his 'mastery' phase of life. Heck the way he portrays himself he comes across as genuine and sincerely 'at ease' and happy person in life itself.As is Julia!! Loved her character. People are not talking about these two... and taking their performances as 'granted' but this is what happens when you have two masters in their field who take on roles in their craft. Julia's smile is so genuine and you can also tell she found peace. (By the way not gushing over her like a fanboy because I actually hated Eat Pray Love.. lol!)Finally, the main character. Amazing job. Amazing portrayal. But as a reviewer pointed out, he susses out his three 'friends' in the beginning by judging them and yet we are supposed to sympathize him all the way? They could have shown more nuance where it's not always black and white and good vs evil where the big evil villain is the mean school yard bully.But I am willing to overlook it. Hate to repeat myself, but look at the clunker of trash Tenet is from a 200 million dollar budget. When you have garbage like that and Unhinged coming out, you are bound to like Wonder as it shows PURE CLASS. (I also recommend the movie Gifted for anyone interested.)Finally, the principal. FANTASTIC performance. He sort of looked like a wise old Thoreasque type of person...soft spoken but teeming with understaning and wisdom where at one stage of the film he even empathized with the mean kid. Loved it.All in all great film and much needed. Many reviewers who gave negative reviews will point out we are being swayed by emotion. I absolutely agree.

      "An emotional film adapted from a best-selling novel.This is about a child called August 'Auggie' with medical issues and a rare facial disfigurement. He has undergone many surgical procedures in order to help him and to help him fit into normal society.He has extremely supportive parents. A cool dad, a loving mum, and a sister, who feels largely neglected because of the extra attention Auggie's medical conditions demand.Auggie's parents decide that it is time for him to enter mainstream education, he has been home schooled up to this point and his exclusion makes him feel extremely nervous of the prospects of fitting in. His first day is an emotional roller-coaster, we see how the other children either react to his deformity, some with stares and how others bully because they do not know any better! We see how he needs to handle all the various other children he encounters.It is probable that we all knew (or were) an 'Auggie' at school, the child who was picked on because of a difference of some kind. Unfortunately the film has a very corny ending, but what this film does well is to teach us to appreciate a person for who they are and not for what they look like.

I usually have a big dislike for children actors in general, but in case of Jacob Tremblay who portraits the main protagonist Auggie, I was absolutely impressed and I enjoyed the entire movie a lot. With Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson we also have two huge names in the cast, who presented this story very well. In the past I got a little tired of seeing Owen Wilson, no matter in which role, but here as Auggie's dad, I have nothing to complain about. This is one of those movies where all the pieces come together and you just have a great time watching it. If you liked movies like Forret Gump or I Am Sam (I am not saying that Wonder plays in the exact same league), you might want to give this one a try as well. Great acting, great message and on top beautifully shot and directed. 0.29039855072463766\n",
      "The film opens promisingly, with our disabled protagonist strugling at a new school. This is my first qualm with it. Instead of using an actor with Treacher Collins syndrome they put makeup on a famous child actor. Not too bad so Ill let it slide. Then we see that the sister of our protagonist is being neglected as the family only cares about their disabled child. There's some character development with her and her grandmother but that thread goes nowhere. The family keeps treating Auggie better than her. We also get a storyline of the sister's friend that suddenly turns a cold shoulder towards her for no particular reason, later stating it was because the sister ignored her in the first place even thought that isnt the case. Any character development with the sister is just ignored and at the end of the film nothing changes for her.Auggie is being bullied in school but one of the bullies becomes his friend. Which is a nice story telling device but later in the film Auggie and his now friend begin the become bullies themselves when they laugh at a pair of children in the science competition who failed. So all of Auggie's character development of being bullied is suddnely null and void.The entire film builds up towards a big summer camp where Auggie is being bullied. He runs away into the forest and meets some bigger, badder builles but him and the people who were bulying him before fight them off and become friends. He goes home and meets his parents and they all live happily forever after. Auggie having lots of friends and his sister being painfully neglected by her parents.

When we are in someones room like Auggie's or Via's it is usually when they aren't feeling great and the lighting is darker. When they are happy the lighting is brighter. It has a very good takeaway message that we shouldn't change how we act because someone looks different, but we should change how we look at things. The story was developed well (of course it helps that is was based off a book) and very enjoyable. 0.48100000000000004\n",
      "I am not a fan of Julia Roberts, but I have seen a several movies of this little kid Jacob Tremblay and I really like this little actor. Wonder is a fantastic movie that works on many levels. It had something of the movie Jack 1996 (a special kid goes to school for the first time) and Flipped 2010 (the way the same experience is showed from different perspectives).Because the movie is shown from many different angles, you get a peak in the minds of many characters this movies has. You get to feel the feelings of the people in the movie. The script is well written. Someway a bit too perfect. Acting was great, from all people in this movie. I really loved it.I saw this movie with my 8 years old daughter. The only thing I struggled with, watching this movie, is that if you are different, you have to be very smart to stand out. Irl this does not work that way. So maybe this is the magical dream of Hollywood that makes this movie have the feeling of a dream.I hope Hollywood will guide Jacob Tremblay better than many little kids who began an amazing acting career and ended up downhill. He is a special kid, like Owen Wilson is a special man. Thumbs up for this movie, might be the best of 2017. At least it is my favorite. 0.28242187499999993\n",

      "In this Stephen Chbosky directed (Beauty and the Beast, The Perks of Being a Wallflower) film, written by Choboky, Steve Conrad (Patriot, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty), Jack Thorne (National Treasure, The Fades) and R.J. Palacio (novelist), Jacob Tremlay (Room, The Smurfs 2) stars as August 'Auggie' Pullman.When his Mum Isabel (Julia Roberts: Pretty Woman, Notting Hill) thinks he needs more than home-schooling, she and his Dad Nate (Owen Wilson: No Escape, Zoolander 2) decide to send him to mainstream elementary. On a tour of the school organised by Headteacher Mr Tushman (Mandy Patinkin: The Princess Bride, TVs Homeland), Auggie meets three new children, Justin (Bryce Gheisar: A Dog's Purpose, TVs Walk the Prank) a spoiled bully, Charlotte (Elle McKinnon: Travelers, Once Upon a Time) who only likes to talk about herself and scholarship student Jack Will (Noah Jupe: Suburbicon, TVs The Night Manager).On his first day, his sister Via (Izabela Vidovic: Homefront, TVs Supergirl) advises him to let the other children stare because 'You can't try and blend in, when you were born to stand out,' but with Justin and his gang (Amos - Ty Consiglio: Woody Woodpecker, Thirty-Seventeen, Miles - Kyle Breitkopf: Parental Guidance, TVs The Whispers and Henry - James A. Hughes: TVs Hit the Road) determined to bully him, he struggles to make friends. His sister Via, meanwhile, has just lost the only one she had, Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell: A Walk Amongst the Tombstones, Aloha) who has returned from Summer Camp no longer wanting to know her. Will drama geek Justin (Nadji Jeter: Grown Ups & 2, The 5th Wave) persuade her to join in auditions for the school play?Auggie's teacher Mr Browne (Daveed Diggs: Zootropolis, Ferdinand) tries his best to help, but it takes Auggie's prowess at science to gain him a new friend in Jack, but will it last?This was a beautiful feel-good movie. Yes it was sad as I expected, and yes you will need to take a large pack of tissues but it also had some wonderful strong messages about kindness, true friendship, love and appreciating someone for who they really are - there are some adults out there that could learn from this, let alone children. There were laughs too but tears will be plentiful as many people in the audience were coming out crying, so I don't think I was the only person touched by the emotion in this endearing film.It stays mostly true to the book which is always a plus point for me and all the adults and child actors were superb, as well as those mentioned above, the character of Summer (Millie Davis: The Best Man Holiday, TVs Orphan Black) was spot on. The Pullman family journey felt real, as did those of each of the other characters.A story of friendship, perseverance and most of all, kindness. Always choose kindness. 0.2662846956964604\n",
      "In recent years, it can be said that it was the era of light and shadow explosion. People's criticism of the film is not just amazing special effects, meticulous scene layout, psychedelic light and shadow art effects. Although people's stimulation of the senses is still unhurried, the real fascination of the movie is still the emotion that changes with the emotion of the plot of the movie in just over two hours. The ultimate reason is the resonance between people and identification. The sense has the magic of making people black. The main line in the movie is Auggie. In fact, he wants to use this born disabled boy to show the magic of miracles, so that the people who are abandoned by his friends around him become stronger, and people who get vanity through lies Faced with himself, and guided the kind-hearted boy to show his goodness bravely, and made the bullies realize his mistakes.

And, sure enough, reactions to his face mean that he gets started at and labelled as a freak.I felt that I could predict this entire film from the trailer - that the schoolkids would learn that you can't judge a book from its cover in a feelgood kind of way. But, while that was undoubtedly part of the package, this film pleased me by exploring some of the other characters as much as Auggie. In particular his big sister Via's story is followed through comprehensively and effectively, and she moved me as much, if not more, than Auggie did.Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play Mom and Dad: neither is tested very much, although both have moments.

It made me mad, it made me cry and it made me extremely happy all in the span of one hour and 53 minutes. The whirlwind of emotions I experienced during this movie was impeccable and I completely fell in love with the character Auggie and his sweet soul. He was even a bit humorous which made me like him that much more. Auggie was such an inspiring character by wanting to attend public school and still persevering even after he was bullied and talked bad about by his classmates and most importantly by one student who he thought to be his friend. He had such a positive attitude throughout most of the movie and the times that he did get emotional really touched my heart because the way the actor displayed it and the mother's response was so realistic. The way the daughter was feeling in the movie made me a bit upset, however. She was so understanding and loved her brother so much but she did not receive a lot of attention from her parents which she suffered from and it showed. I liked how the maker of the movie showed the movie from each prospective, however, the way he switched the scenes to show which child the perspective was from reminded me of The Diary of A Wimpy Kid movie writings. I do not have a different suggestion on how to better transition to a different perspective and I do not believe this took away from the dramatic, moving, and entertaining aspect of the movie though. 0.2624389051808407\n",

      "Owen Wilson (\"Nate\") and Julia Roberts (\"Isabel\") are two extremely likable actors. We can easily believe them as loving, concerned parents. In this case, they have a child, \"Auggie,\" (Jacob Tremblay, who does his best under tons of make-up) who has a facial deformity. At the age of 10, they decide it's time to put Auggie in public school. That is sort of the inciting incident for this story.I understand this film is based on a book. And I can appreciate what this child may have gone through and the challenges he faced. But what bothered me is that Nate (whose job I never figured out) seems to be super wealthy, allowing Isabel to stay home (in New York City, or somewhere near it, in a nice brownstone) to homeschool Auggie, which she does a great job of. Because of Nate's wealth and Isabel's ability to homeschool Auggie, he has a pretty great life. In this regard, despite his handicap, it was hard for me to feel sorry for him.Auggie's long-suffering big sister \"Via\" (Izabela Vidovic) obviously loves Auggie but feels that her parents' entire focus is him, and she might be right. This is obviously something that will resonate as the story plays out.Isabel and Nate bring Auggie to school, where the principal is Mandy Patinkin (\"Mr. Tushman\" -- a name that all involved must have thought was hysterically funny), who looks like an old orthodox Jewish rabbi.While Mr. Tushman lovingly welcomes Auggie to the school, he (and the other teachers) apparently forgot to do some sensitivity training amongst their students. For what seemed like an upscale semi-private school, there were a handful of obnoxious bullies who decide to make Auggie's life a living hell.In this way, there is nothing unusual about this movie. The child is being bullied. And what an easy target. He has a face that makes him look like the figure in the famous Munch painting, \"The Scream.\"So, the story plays out predictably: Auggie gets bullied, but does have at least one friend (or so it seems); Via \"acts out\" because she's not getting enough attention, the family dog dies, injecting more sadness and despair in the lives of our leads, a bully is finally fingered and the principal inexplicably seems to have accumulated a number of drawings in which the bully depicts Auggie as a hideous monster.Things are talked out, Auggie does get a real friend, Via finds a hot black boyfriend (not to mention reconnecting with her best friend, who had shunned her, not to mention taking over for said best friend as the lead in \"Our Town\") and Auggie graduates, with Isabel telling him that he's a real \"wonder.\"Ultimately I feel like the screenplay \"checked all the boxes.\" Emotions were manipulated to guide us through \"sadness\" and \"happiness\" -- but I could sense that that's what was happening, so I could never really commit to this film.At a certain point in the film I got tired of hearing Auggie whine about his condition. While his whining was understandable, it just didn't have the impact that the filmmakers must have thought it would.Owen has a calming influence; Julia is always super-present, and the other actors did their jobs well. But it all added up to a subpar story at best. 0.210560606060606\n",

Plus, the way their lives are related makes the audience perceive they are actually reading chapters of the book, making them feel identified with a childhood or parenthood stages.Wonder is a true lesson of life, that unveil those masks we use to wear at some point in our life, those moments when we decide to hide behind a Halloween mask, instead of showing who we really are.It only takes courage, kindness and friendship to make the difference in this world and -at least -once in your life- receive a standing ovation from the crowd.Beautiful and inspiring! 0.1772321428571429\n",
      "OK, it is just a new heartwarming movie with a nice message to all of you who still judge by what you see! What I like about this movie is the way the director shows what goes on without sparing the \"victim\". I was heavily bullied at school and I can't even compare what I had been through with this kid. In my case, in Brazil, it was quite a stage where I was younger than the class I ended up in 8th grade, which had many teens who flunked and they were there to do it all over. Back in those days, if you flunked three subjects you would have to take the whole year again. Stupid school rules at that time. That was 33 years ago and I still see that some things never change. Students will pick someone to be bullied. Cliques will be all over, tribes, misfits, these things don't change people are what they are everywhere: insecure creatures looking for answers to their existential issues. They are not sure and the way they handle them is by picking other people to blame. Is it going to be over? I am not sure.

The cute boy Jack Will who was first forced to be friends with Auggie, but then only wanting to spend time with him.

      "The main characters in the movie are Auggie, Nate, Via, Isabel, Jack, Juliam, and Charlotte.Giving a brief summary of the plot is based on the New York Times bestseller, this movie tells the incredibly inspiring and heartwarming story of August Pullman, a boy with facial differences who enters the fifth grade, attending a mainstream elementary school for the first time.The possible theme for this story is Wonder may ostensibly be a film about a young boy's struggle with looking different.The moral for this story is about Family diversity, but lurking just beneath this veneer is a broader message: that all individuals experience personal struggles, so we should be exercising greater empathy to all our neighbors-not just those with visible vulnerabilities.The audience who would like this movie are viewers over the age of 9-14, because it is something they can relate to in their own personal experiences at school.In my opinion of the movie,\n",
      "The introduction was expressive and alluring and captured my attention right from the beginning. The music was memorable and are something that I could personally relate to in my own experiences. The dialogue was expessive and meaningful and full of conviction. The actors were professional and gave the film a greater depth of the character and a natural appeal. I loved this film because it was hearfelt, very natural, and beautifully unique. This is one of the best coming-to-age films I ever seen that will make an impact in diversity.Overall, I would recommend the movie because it can do much more for that tween who looks different than just help them get through the 5th grade. 0.2997914862914862\n",

      "This is the most feel good movie I've ever seen - and I mean that in a good way. It really made me feel so good!Put differently, this was one of the most optimistic movies they could make about a kid with a physical deformity. The adults (with the exception of one lady) are all trying to be kind and supportive. The kids are all dealing with their own problems but they are each trying to figure out what's the right way to behave. They're kids; they mess up; but they try to be better.It was nice to see the focus on the older sister too, who is also dealing with her own issues and not struggling with feeling resentful towards her brother for capturing all of her parent's attention. But at the same time she wants to be there for him as much as she can. She sympathizes with him, but she also teaches him to recognize when others are genuinely dealing with problems and that not everything is about him. And the parents also make an effort to make sure they're not forgetting their daughter in their preoccupation with their son.Basically, this is a movie, where people do the right things. In so many movies people will do the wrong thing and then are too afraid to correct the mistakes and then the mistake will come crashing down on them for dramatic effect. It was refreshing to see this movie veer away from that.The performances were great. Julia Roberts is of course great. Owen Wilson doesn't have a heavy role at all, but he just plays the awesome dad role. And Jacob Tremblay is of course AMAZING. I don't know how a kid can be such a good actor. But honestly, all the other kids did a fantastic job too and they all acted exactly like how kids that age would act and had exactly the dynamic kids that age would have.But this really is a feel good movie - one where things ultimately end up how you wish they would. Real life, I'm afraid, would be far crueler than the events of this movie. :'( 0.2299313822751322\n",
      "What an unquestionably incredible cast, playing characters so truly and authentically lovable that, any random character posing as an antagonist was like a drop of sound drowning in the vastness of a space that embraced a sun emitting warmth upon the system it anchors. Yet somehow still, like a tree falling in the woods, any threat posed, was felt.Wonder, is unequivocally, wonderful. This film goes straight for the jugular, in that, you spend a sizable amount of this movie with a lump in your throat.The Pullman family, including Daisy, was a depiction of a family structure that was imperfectly perfect in how it handled its growing pains, by accomplishing the best and perhaps only action necessary to overcome tribulation; be together.Sure, there was a happy ending for everyone, however, Wonder did an insanely amazing job at making the characters deserve it, and made the viewer feel like they did in fact earn it.To give this film anything less than an 8 would be robbing it of the standing ovation we all deserve at least once in our lives.

      "I knew the basic story of Wonder before I saw it and I assumed it was aimed at kids but I think its the kind of film that works well for both kids and adults. There's certainly a fair amount of food for thought, as it were. Unsurprisingly, it is quite sad and sentimental, although I'm glad to say that I didn't feel it was unnecessarily piled in sugary sweet emotions - it focusses on the childs difficulties starting at a public school and his reaction to being made fun of for his looks. I suppose it is perhaps a little predictable but I thought that it wasn't as tacky as it perhaps could have come across and also I thought that the main cast did pretty well in their respective roles, especially Jacob Tremblay as the main character, August aka Auggie and Julia Roberts as his mum. It deals with bullying, fear/shame and so on - important topics for adolescents certainly.Would I recommend it? yes I would. 0.09978070175438597\n",

I loved the way the film was told from each major characters point of view. I think it was a tearjerker in the best sense, because I don't think it was trying to be overly cloying. Jacob Tremblay was virtually unrecognizable in his excellent makeup. But for me, the highlight was the boy who played his friend, Noah Jupe, who was so believable and real, that by the end, I was more impressed by him than Tremblay. Having worked with special education children my entire adult life, I found this film to be the most involving film about elementary age children I have ever seen, and purchased it immediately. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson were good in their supporting parts, and a second viewing was even better than the first.

We take characters with disabilities and turn them into heroes or objects of pity. Then cast people who don't have a disability in the role. Maybe we should cast Julia Roberts as Harriet Tubman or Rosa Parks next, smh.Although I did appreciate the way they examined how a child's disability can affect their siblings, they did it in a very surface level \"lack of attention\" way.

      "It's so nice to get an excellent movie that touches its social issue with care, and respect, and it's aimed at KIDS! So all the terrible cash grab kids movies that are coming out, have no excuse for being bad! I think the demographic for this movie would be 5th Graders, or kids that are 10 years old.What I love most about it, is the way it handles the school bullying subject, and facial deformity issues. This movie is based off the book 'Wonder'. I was actually a little bit concerned, because while the book is one of my all-time favorites, it could get a little too graphic at times, and in this movie, a few kids (in 5th Grade) said the \"C' word twice. But I don't think that's too much of a bother.That being said though, this movie does have two problems:1. The pacing. This movie tries to do the story of 'Same situation with different points of view'. However, while I really like this trope, it does make the story feel clunky, and poorly paced. Which leads into:2. No focus on the bully, Julian. There is a scene where it heavily implies that his parents are very overprotective, it feels very one- sided; I did wish Julian got his own side of the story, to make him and his family feel more fleshed out, and not cardboard cutouts.Despite the two problems I have, the performances, the writing, the production values, and the dialogue are all TOP.

      "Adapted from the novel by RJ Palacio, Wonder guides through the year long journey of a young boy named Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), who's diagnosed with Treacher-Collins Syndrome, going from years of homeschooling to in class learning as he deals with the trials and tribulations kids normally deal with when walking into the classroom. From bullying, to acceptance to adjusting and finally to getting respected, Auggie not only found his way around the classroom, but also touched the lives of the audience being that no matter how different you are, we are all unique in some way and that one's physicality should never be judged.Under the direction of Stephen Chbosky, his adaptation was handled with extreme sensitivity and succeeded by keeping the themes mature, but not over-the-top by way of melancholy. The makeup effects by Arjen Tuiten were well-crafted and are in full detail to give the viewers a visual indicator of the physical condition Auggie faces everyday in his life. From the sad looking eyes, to the facial linings to the little stubs of skin for the ears, Auggie no fault of his own, will likely have to deal with facing the cruel world as he will be bombarded with stares, belittling and discrimination for the way he looks. But however, Chbosky who also co-wrote the script along with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, succeeded in making the viewer realize that Auggie is going through the same issues any normal kid goes through during their school years and that his issues are no different than anyone else's. His love and passion for things are also very normal. I mean what kid doesn't like \"Star Wars\" or \"Minecraft\"? He seems very bright in science and has an eccentric sense of humour and an imagination that gets him through his days. And though this movie seems to be more idealistic as opposed to realistic, it's neither distracting or cringe inducing.When it came to performances Jacob Tremblay was absolutely stunning here as Auggie who provides an electrifying blend of kindness and intellect even when he's hiding his face under a spaceman's helmet. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson were perfect as the supporting parents who helped Auggie on his journey to find social acceptance by those around him. The real standout comes from Izabela Vidovic as Auggie's sister Via who lets herself take a backseat to let her parents look after Auggie due to his condition. Even though she may not have her brother's medical condition, like every other teen, she has personal problems of her own.Auggie's mother, Isabel (Roberts) sacrificed her own career path to look after Auggie and even homeschooled during all his difficult times which included having 27 surgeries. But now Isabel and father Nate (Wilson) enroll him at Beecher Rep in a normal class where he will learn to socialize with other students and to adjust outside the sheltered life he's been accustomed to all his life. Though understanding they're doing the right thing, they both know this new life for him will be a rough road ahead as Auggie will have to deal with bullying, staredowns and isolation. And when his parents let him go on his new path of life, all the kids' conversations are stalled as they stare and snicker at him. Chbosky sees this a normal thing as kids go through those phases unaware that through all the staring and putdowns are hurtful and that it's better to accept a person for who they are and not what they look like.Like a lot of these underdog stories with an anti-bullying message, the usual stereotyped characters are eventually shoehorned into the narrative. There's the hip, level-headed teacher Mr. Brownr (Daveed Diggs) who gives assignments that are educational and innovative. Then you have the tough bully named Julian (Bryce Gheisar) who eventually softens up to Auggie later in the movie. Then there's the introverted girl Summer (Millie Davis) who becomes his friend. But the best scenes are when Auggie befriends an outcast named Jack Will (Noah Jupe) who accepts him in spite of his working class status.What stands out from this movie is that \"Wonder\" doesn't focus on the trials and tribulations of Auggie alone. Other characters have personal dilemmas that also are featured here. There's many scenes involving Via, a shy teen who meets up with an attractive teen named Justin (Nadji Jeter) and eventually enrolls in the drama club at school and auditions for a part in the musical \"Our Town\". We also look into the strained friendship between Via and her friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell) who turned against her during the school year.Like in his previous project \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", Chbosky tries to handle the various issues involving teen angst in a very professional and open manner. This kind of measure assures the audience to try to imagine what it would be like if you were the character/s we're following in the narrative. Everyone has a problem in life and most times it can't be fully solved. Even though Owen Wilson's character Nate might be comic relief does deliver the most uplifting quote in the movie being that tears don't just provide sadness, they also provide joy.If there was one weakness in this movie that makes me cringe every time is near the end of a movie where the climax emanates at the auditorium and Auggie gets an award for his bravery and courage throughout the school year. I mean I'm proud of him that he got that, but it just feels way too cliched that the movie has to end with a nice ribbon on top. It would've been okay if he just felt better about himself and didn't need the award to prove his point.Other than the cliched ending, it is a great feel-good movie that delivers a powerful message of acceptance and compassion. 0.1446066591237046\n",

As a whole, I see it as a story about people and how every day is a constant yet unknowing battle to see and be seen, highlighting the movie's central theme of compassion even more. 0.14419191919191918\n",

And I felt the pain Auggie was feeling. The manner how he surpassed that was amazing. His new friends were amazing. The movie is not perfect? Maybe, every movie has its mistakes.

Why is Auggie bleeding!!? Unless extremely ill with a condition, his cut shouldn't be bleeding.The only downside is not knowing what comes of Julian once his terrible parents pull him out for the next year. This seems to shake him into feeling bad, realizing his actions. After this scene, he's never spoken of again. Was he taken out? Did he maybe get his mom to let him stay? Auggie befriends Julian's friends, so is he cut from his friends? It leaves it dangled, perhaps it was just unknown, though personally I'd of tried to think of something to put. At least a wave \"bye\" to a secondary or main character.Other than that cliff in someone else's life, the movie is with no pun intended, very moving. Happy, feel good ending.

      "This was a very beautiful story with many realistic themes. Augie is a normal kid with some facial differences, who is not as ugly as everyone says he is. When he starts fifth grade, he has a hard time adjusting to the other students. Many people claim it is unrealistic how a kid like Augie made friends. For those of you who have been bullied, I'm sorry. I know how horrible it feels. As someone who grew up with a mental disability, I know how difficult school can be for people who are different, specifically if your disability makes it harder to socialize, presumably harder than having a physical disability. Not everyone in school was nice to me, but I managed to make some friends.When Augie starts school, he has no friends. He notices kids making fun of him. He becomes friends with Jack Will after letting him cheat off his test. Who wouldn't be friends with someone who would do that? Jack is an outsider too, as he is not that smart and only in that school on a scholarship. Jack eventually gives into peer pressure and unknowingly makes fun of Augie to his face. This temporarily ends their friendship. Augie makes one more friend and eventually forgives Jack, after he stands up to school bully Julian and apoligizes to Augie. At the end of the movie the kids are on a feild trip, where they encounter some older bullies. Augie stands up to them, and hence, becomes the class hero. People finally see Augie for who he is, not what he looks like.Unlike most kids movies I've seen, the adults in this movie are not horrible selfish people and actually care about the kids. Augie comes from a loving supportive family. The school principal is fair and takes bullying very seriously. I know not all schools are like that, but this was a private school with better teachers and more student support.I don't have a lot of criticism for this movie, but there are some ways they could have made it better. Focus more on Augie and less on the other characters. The sister and her friend had little to do with Augie's story. Give Julian a backstory. I know Julian was the main school bully, but at the end he seemed truly sorry for what he did. He was strongly influenced by his horrible, possibly abusive mother. He did not deserve the ending he got. I wish the movie could go deeper into that. 0.06315856129685916\n",

      "Yes, it will tug your heartstrings! It will make you cry! It doesn't feel like there are too many feel-good movies like this made anymore, and I didn't realize how much I missed them until I watched this. These days, heavy topics - like a boy with facial deformities going to public school for the first time - tend to veer towards the dark and sad. This one has enough sadness to be realistic but it also imparts important lessons on the viewer without being preachy. It will leave you feeling inspired, grateful, and maybe... full of wonder!

      "August (Auggie), is a boy with a rare facial abnormality who enters the fifth grade. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. In life we all have parts of ourselves that are different, that we have a hard time accepting, because we don't quite fit in with what everyone else sees, so we are deemed unsuitable in society and with our peers. This is not only a feel good movie but one that inspires and uplifts us to be accepting of ourselves, not in spite of our visible differences, but because of them.

      ". . . much if not most of America has been wondering since its release. A virtual sequel to ERIN BROCKOVICH, the \"back story\" of WONDER begins when Erin becomes aware that one of her genes has mutated (surely from drinking PG&E's tainted water). The practical effect of this anomaly is that her next child is an X-MEN candidate, with special psychic powers capable of transforming Hard-Hearted Fascist Neo-Nazi Bullies (or at least their indoctrinated kids) into tolerant Democratic Progressive urchins. Erin eventually sends her son to \"Beecher Middle School.\" In Real Life, Flint, Michigan's Beecher Middle School is considered the very heart of Pedophiliac Repug Party neglect. During the past few months, of course, KGB-controlled Racist Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has conducted a genocidal social-engineering \"experiment\" (under the orders of U.S. Strongman Vlad \"The Mad Russian\" Putin) that makes Erin's toxic California aquifers seem like crystal clear mountain streams in comparison. Even as much of the Michigan State Government has been indicted on murder charges for Snyder\\Putin's lead-laced sewage-contaminated Legionnaire's Disease Death Pandemic in \"Buick City,\" 'Flint-Faced' has entered the Official American Medical Lexicon to denote babies that physically resemble Erin's WONDER child.

      "Hollywood loves to recycle the same old same old, lest we forget some stories are universal to every generation. \"Perks of a Wall Flower\" director Stephen Chbosky's family-friendly feature \"Wonder,\" about a ten-year old lad with facial deformities, reminds us that physical looks aren't everything. Movies about people with malformed faces have been around since the days of silent movies. Mind you, this genre of films can be divided into two kinds: those where the disfigured folks have their looks surgically reconstructed and those who endure their abnormality without the benefit of change. Twenty-nine versions of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" about an ugly soul lurking in a church, have been released hearkening as far as 1909. At least ten versions of the venerable \"Phantom of the Opera\" have been produced, as early as 1916. Joan Crawford made \"A Woman's Face\" (1941) where she regained her good looks through surgery, and Mickey Rourke recovered his looks in the crime thriller \"Johnny Handsome\" (1989). Director David Lynch's celebrated saga \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), a plea for tolerance for the less fortunate, ranks as probably most distinguished. This biographical, 19th century London, England, epic depicted the travails of a horrifically disfigured adult male, John Merrick, who was an otherwise wonderful person. Reconstructive surgery wasn't an option for Merrick. Later, director Peter Bogdanovich's \"Mask\" (1985) dealt with real-life, twentieth-century teen Rocky Dennis afflicted with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia from birth that made his face appear misshapen and bloated like a caricature. \"The Elephant Man\" and \"Mask\" were far more graphic than \"Wonder,\" but each reflected the shock that occurred when normal people reacted to abnormal people. Typically, when we see somebody who doesn't blend in with the rest of us, we tend to alienate and ridicule them. We treat them like circus freaks. Although it boasts a happy ending, \"Wonder\" doesn't conclude with our protagonist emerging from surgery with a new face. He had to endure twenty-seven surgeries to look the way he does.The charismatic hero of \"Wonder\" suffers from a rare hereditary genetic disorder known as Treacher Collins syndrome. The ears, eyes, cheekbones, and chin are deformed, and it ranges from mild to severe. Indeed, August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay of \"Room\") wears a plastic astronaut's helmet in public to conceal his countenance as his parents. Auggie's doting mom Isabel (Julia Roberts of \"Erin Brockovich\") has been schooling him at home. Now, she can no longer adequately tutor him, because she lacks the experience to teach him about his favorite subject—science. Reluctantly, Nate Pullman (Owen Wilson of \"No Escape\") and she enroll him at Beecher Prep School, but they do so with great trepidation. Isobel fears what lies ahead for her son as she watches him enter the school. \"Dear God,\" she pleads to herself, \"please let them be nice to him.\" Auggie has a face that resembles something a demented plastic surgeon assembled from spare parts that didn't match. Nevertheless, despite his horrific appearance, Auggie is just another pre-teen who shares the same dreams and joys of any normal youngster. \"Wonder\" reminds us that just because all of us aren't stamped from the same mould is no reason to estrange those with differences. Initially, when Auggie's parents brought him to Beecher, the compassionate headmaster, Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin of \"The Princess Bride\"), recruited three students of Auggie's age to give him a tour.No sooner has Auggie settled into his fifth-grade class than he becomes the object of derision. \"What's the deal with your face?\" one cruel student inquires. \"Darth HIDEOUS,\" sneers another classmate, while one more compares Auggie with Freddy Krueger. Things reach crisis proportions when Auggie's teacher discovers a classroom photo that Auggie has been digitally deleted from the picture. A note on the back of the photograph reads ugly people aren't allowed in the picture. Gradually, Auggie makes friends, but his first and closest pal Jack Will (Noah Jupe of \"Suburbicon\") unwittingly betrays him during a Halloween carnival. Jack confides in his obnoxious classmates that were he Auggie he would hang himself. Auggie overhears Jack because our young hero isn't wearing his astronaut outfit as he had planned but came instead as a \"Scream\" demon. Jack regrets his treachery. Courageously, Auggie perseveres despite Jack's duplicity. The gauntlet of insults that Auggie runs strengthens his resolve. After Mr. Tushman discovers the culprits who made the youngster's life an ordeal, things turn one-hundred-eighty degrees for Auggie. Predictably, Auggie triumphs over his worst adversaries and emerges as the most popular student.Director Stephen Chbosky and scenarists Steve Conrad of \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" and Jack Thorne of \"A Long Way Down\" adapted R.J. Palacio's bestselling novel. According to Palacio's website, she served as \"an art director and book jacket designer, designing covers for countless well-known and not so well-known writers in every genre of fiction and nonfiction.\" She had spent twenty years putting off writing her first novel until she realized she could dawdle no more. Ironically, she didn't create the cover for her own novel as she had for some many other authors! The filmmakers have adhered faithfully to Palacio's basic premise. We shouldn't isolate others simply because they don't mirror our own image. \"Wonder\" scrutinizes the dreadful consequences of bullying. Ultimately, Chbosby and company pull their punches with their saccharine treatment of the subject matter. Fortunately, \"Wonder\" doesn't degenerate entirely into a sermonizing after-school special because Auggie has a self-depreciating sense of humor. The sticks and stones our young hero endures during his anguish transforms him into a resilient person instead of a hopeless cry-baby who capitulates in the face of a crisis. Jacob Tremblay delivers a sensitive, low-key performance beneath the layers of prosthetic make-up that he sports throughout this 113-minute, PG-rated, feel-good feature. Happily, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson restrain themselves, too. Sure, \"Wonder\" will tug at your heart-strings, but only those with glacial indifference to this little fellow's labors will leave the theater with a dry eye. 0.09581412868177572\n",
      "Greetings from Lithuania.\"Wonder\" (2017) was a very good family movie. When in a movie you see a scenes where 5th grade students are switching tables during lunch and \"choosing sides\" by doing that and you look at it with interest, you have to acknowledge the strength of a story, writing and directing skill.This is a good-feel movie which isn't overdone with to corny or sentimental scenes (although there were many sentimental scenes out there, they were done very well and did not bother me for a second).Overall, \"Wonder\" is that great guilty pleasure meant for all family - everyone will love it.

We had strong performances from all the cast, including the child actors, which is always nice. The film gave a pretty accurate of what living with a disability would be like, showing all the good and all the bad. I really only have one complaint with the film, and that is that Owen Wilson (the father) doesn't say his iconic phrase \"Wow.\" There were more than enough instances throughout the film where he could have used this line. Some examples that come to mind are when he sees that his wife finished her research paper and when he sees his daughter in the lead role of the play.

The only fights are between children, and they never get truly violent. This is a heart warming and inspiring story of a boy and his family, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I want to read the book this is based on.Jacob Tremblay, who I remember from the movie 'Room' gives yet another excellent performance as August Pullman (Auggie), though he looks very different here. The makeup artists have done a good job of making him look 'different' but not scary or repulsive. Other child actors have provided good support. The school scenes are well done. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are very good as the loving parents. Izabela Vicovich as his elder sister Via is a great new find. She is beautiful, but seems a little older than what someone who is just 4 years older than Auggie would look like, but that is a minor point, in my opinion.There is a message of embracing diversity in subtle ways throughout the movie (Via's boyfriend, and Auggie's new friend are both African American), and Auggie is of course very different from those around him. The movie does not become preachy about diversity, which is good.The story is told by different characters, but mostly by Auggie, from the time he was born, and the effect of his cranial disease on his family is described in his words, and later in scenes. The different relationships between the family members, and friends are well portrayed.This is a feel good movie, which is perfect at this time of the year.

Instead, although it's simple, it's still effective in its themes and the cast is aces. Jacob Tremblay continues to show that he has a true talent, something he showed in Room.

      "The result is a delicate film, but one that becomes too childish. It's a safe path not to delve into some pertinent discussions. Bullying, for example, is addressed in the school environment, even showing that the child who does these acts also usually has emotional problems. But everything is extremely light, in a way that works in the book but needed more weight when shown in theaters. With such interesting and current themes, the film could go deeper into the issue of prejudice, provoking those who watch the film to an internal questioning. By choosing the simple path, the film becomes enjoyable to watch, but misses the opportunity to be more than that. 0.15357142857142855\n"

      "My first comment is among these days when films are fast & supposed to be exciting this film is slow with subtle words and actions. It is so rare to witness that. I should recommend watching more films like this one. Not to mention the performance of the actors who give this feeling. I don't about the crew or producers, but the director Paolo Sorrentino had nailed it - all of it! 0.14880952380952378\n",
      "Mediocre is how I would describe this film in one word. The film directed by Paolo Sorrentino is primarily based in a Swiss health spa beneath the Alps. Picturesque yes but quite boring. The film has two old guys as the central characters. Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). The best friends bide their slow paced, idyllic lives by having private bets, reminiscing old sexual conquests and comparing prostate issues. Ballinger is a retired orchestra conducter and Boyle is a still active film director. I was attracted to the film by the relatively all-star cast including Rachel Weisz and a cameo by Paloma Faith. However at least half an hour could have been cut to speed up the dreary pace. Ballinger is hounded for want of a better word by HM The Queen to come out of retirement and perform his 'Simple Songs?' The locations do not make up for the shortcomings that I have addressed and I was left disappointed. -0.030555555555555558\n",
      "I'd never heard of this movie, but I was quickly drawn into it, and found it quite beautiful. The storyline is simple, the pace is slow, yet it manages to effortlessly entertain. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score absolutely perfect...each of the actors/actresses does a wonderful job in their roles. The film does well to portray a varying range of life, and especially the journey of growing old. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this movie - it is a true gem! 0.34734848484848485\n",
      "Youth is the sort of film we are supposed to like: esteemed Italian director and Academy Award winner, venerable actors, weighty subject matter. Yet, in the end it is one big disappointment. Here is why, and beware the spoilers.1. The female characters are portrayed as weak, infantile or voiceless. Rachel Weisz has, by her own account, two jobs: daughter and assistant to her father the famous composer (which make it one job). Unable to pursue her own life, she is also afraid of heights. Although she confronts her father about his failings, we last see her being held like a baby by the bland mountaineer while hanging from the side of a mountain. Jane Fonda, in a brief cameo, berates Harvey Keitel while claiming she made her own career. Yet she is reduced to a raving mess on an airplane after learning of his suicide. The quiet masseuse, when asked why she never speaks, replies that she has nothing to say. Caine's wife is portrayed in just one scene, and she is reduced to nothing more than a catatonic silent scream.2. Auxiliary characters such as the violin boy and the girl in the store do not emerge organically from the story. Rather they seem to be dropped into the story to mouth the thoughts of the writer/director, who apparently wants to make sure that the audience doesn't miss his intent.3. The film is over filled with one surrealistic trope after another to the point of bursting.4. Michael Caine's character is wrought over the realization late in life that devoting his time to his art/work came at the expense of relationships with people who mattered, namely his wife and daughter. Harvey Keitel, seeking to find a continued purpose in life by writing a new screenplay, kills himself upon realizing he can't do it. This is the stuff of a college sophomore who has taken a course in existential philosophy and became fascinated by The Stranger. There is a surface level philosophical question, but not much depth to it.5. I could go on about the portrayal of emotionally empty sex, dining rooms filled with mute couples and mannequin like guests, people marching like automatons to the spa and so forth, all of which leave the viewer with a dismal view of life.I give credit to Caine, Keitel and Weisz for doing the best they could with marginal material. The film itself, however, is pretty to look at and dismal to watch. 0.06884469696969697\n",

      "Barely 5 minutes out of the movie and I am still catching my breath. What started off as a almost comical movie turned into a deeply layered masterpiece. The unexpected, the unnecessary, the necessary... I wish I could express what the scenes do to you as a viewer but you must experience this yourself. Preferably sitting on a not too comfortable couch or chair. This is not a luxurious movie spoiling you, although the scenery of the movie tells otherwise. It takes work, it takes work for you to understand the characters. But please, undergo this work. Feel what they are feeling. See what they are seeing and you will experience, what they are experiencing. I have laughed, cried, judged, held my breath and experienced this movie as ad adventure.

      "Youth (2015): Dir: Paolo Sorrentino / Cast: Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano, Jane Fonda: Memories of yesterday invade one's current state as two longtime friends stay at a resort. Michael Caine plays Fred Ballinger, a retired composer who is approached with an offer to perform for the Queen but he refuses. Harvey Keitel plays Mick Boyle, a struggling filmmaker whose final film is botched when convincing his leading actress to appear becomes problematic. Rachel Weisz plays Lena, Fred's daughter who is reconnecting with him and became his assistant. She finds romance in a poorly handled and distracting subplot regarding a climber. Paul Dano plays a struggling actor who regrets that his most notable role is playing a robot. Jane Fonda makes an appearance as the diva whom Boyle is trying to cast in his film and she delivers an icy yet blunt monologue to Boyle that is painful but true in more ways than one. Director Paolo Sorrentino was celebrated with The Great Beauty but his efforts here are uneven with numerous distracting unnecessary shots. The production values are top notch with gorgeous locations and photography, particularly during a dream sequence. Screenplay starts out well but becomes disjointed until the finale where an invitation is met nicely. Theme regards ageing and how it screws with one's memory and perception. It plays on one's self worth as Ballinger deals with his relationship with composing, and Boyle struggling with completing his life's work and roadblocks preventing him, and Lena attempting to connect with a parent.

      "The film centers around 80 something composer/conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine). He is at an Alps resort spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and long time friend and director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). Fred is retired and has refused to conduct for the Queen. Mick is with a group of writers as they are attempting to come up with a script for \"Life's Last Day\" and spend their time attempting to compose final death bed endings for the film. There are a number of minor subplots and players at the resort so you can create whatever theme or metaphor you desire for the film.The film was very artsy and theme driven. It appeared to focus on dreams and desires which are best left to youth, but I am sure one could get the opposite meaning. The film has a lot of good lines that appear that they tie things together, but then fall short.\"I have to believe everything to make things up.\"\n",
      "\"Human beings know how to be pathetic when they try.\"\n",
      "\"Emotions are overrated\" contradicted by \"Emotions is all we have.\"\n",
      "\"I know you can't levitate.\"Rachel Weisz has a soliloquy where she nails it, but I wasn't sure what she nailed. Paloma Faith plays herself as an oversexed pop star. Madalina Diana Ghenea gets naked, which seems to be an odd sell point for an artsy film, but then again so did Michael Caine, and now I am blind.One thing I can say for certain is this is not a formula film. It is a series of scenes, many of which are isolated with no real connection to the main plot.People come to the spa to find themselves, realize their desires, and maybe make their dreams come true... 0.13163265306122446\n",
      "YOUTH (2015) *** Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Jane Fonda, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano, Madalina Diana Ghenea. Caine and Keitel have a field day as aged friends - an acclaimed musical composer/conductor and a waning filmmaker - who spend time together at an Alpine retreat attempting to relax, reflect and perhaps learn from their past for a better , albeit, short future. Filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino creates a nearly ethereal spa for the principals and exquisite cinematography by Luca Bigazzi elevates the film's aesthetic look. Caine and Keitel have dynamic chemistry as the old chums and Weisz adds subtle layers of neuroses as the former's daughter who also stays for an extended visit.

      "I saw the trailer for this film, I was instantly attracted because of members of the cast, and it did look interesting, and with good critical reviews and award nominations I was even more attracted, directed by Paolo Sorrentino (The Consequences of Love, This Must Be the Place, The Great Beauty). Basically Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) is a retired classical music composer, Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is a filmmaker working on his next project, both men are Septuagenarians and best friends staying at a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred is approached by an Emissary for Queen Elizabeth II (The Inbetweeners' Alex Macqueen) who want him to perform his popular piece \"Simple Songs\" for the birthday concert of Prince Philip, Fred downs this offer down, saying he is not interested in performing anymore, although when alone he composes pieces in his head. Mick is working with a group of scriptwriters to develop the screenplay for his next film, which he calls his \"testament\", also with them is actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano) who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only recognised for playing a robot. Other quirky individuals inhabiting the hotel include a young masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic), the overweight Diego Maradona (Roly Serrano) and Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea). Fred and Mick reflect on their lives, including women they both previously had feelings for and their friendship over the years, they admit that their memories are fading and they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) is his personal assistant and married to Mick's son, but the husband leaves her for pop star Paloma Faith, who he says is much better in bed, Lena vents her anger on her father, who was always distant during her childhood and growing up. The Emissary returns with the same offer for Fred, he still refuses to play his popular piece, even for royalty, the Emissary gets frustrated with the lack of explanation, Lena cries when Fred finally explains that the soprano part of his \"Simple Songs\" belongs to his wife, but she can no longer sing, the Emissary understands. Mick completes his screenplay with the writers and is satisfied, his leading actress Brenda Morel (Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda), who the role is written for and has worked with Mick on eleven of his previous films, makes a surprise visit to the resort, Brenda tells him she has taken a television role instead, she says television is the future and cinema is the past, she also tells Mick he has not made a good film in years. Mick is disheartened and hallucinates all of his leading ladies, including Brenda, surrounding him, he has a final talk with Fred and jumps off the balcony right in front of him, Fred is devastated. Following the funeral for his friend, Fred decides for the first time in years to visit his wife, she is senile and in a care home in Venice, in the end Fred returns to the United Kingdom for the concert before the Queen and the Prince to conduct \"Simple Songs\", with new soprano Sumi Jo. Also starring Ed Stoppard as Julian, Nate Dern as Funny Screenwriter, Alex Beckett as Bearded Screenwriter, Mark Gessner as Shy Screenwriter and Tom Lipinski as Screenwriter in Love. Caine gives a great performance as the veteran conductor refusing to perform for royalty for emotional personal reasons, Keitel is also likable as the aged movie producer and director, they are a great double act, Fonda is fantastic in her short appearance, Weisz is good, and there is a scene-stealing nude scene from the gorgeous Ghenea. This is a great example of an art house film, director Sorrentino is known for doing these sorts of films, it is an unusual blend of simplistic scenes, combined with a witty and funny script, surreal and psychedelic material, and wonderful music by David Lang, all add up to a satisfying alternative comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for the beautiful \"Simple Song #3\". Very good! 0.20896790323873654\n",
      "I do not even comprehend the alternate universe that does not appreciate this film. It was exquisite from beginning to spectacular ending. More truthful dialogue is seldom found in the movies. More perfect cinematography is seldom found in the movies. The pacing was perfection. I was mesmerized the entirety of the film. If you are 20 whine and you failed to appreciate YOUTH, come back to it in 10 years and tell us again how you didn't like it. If you are already older and you failed to appreciate it my condolences to you. My profound thanks to all the movie makers and to the vision of the director.

      "This movie is indeed a great example of how Italian sense of film-making can really be married with contemporary English and Hollywod cast, mixed together with the commonly found philosophical art house blend of ironic comedies. The story really puts a poetic reasoning to the subject matter of old age. The movie is filled with long talks, which look more like responded monologues. But of course any ironic setups won't be complete without actually putting in the opposite of the subject. This movie puts it good a dose of young talents with adequate significance where the irony really bites when it comes. The acting is indeed a great job. Michael Caine can really depict the depth of the character, without having to overly expressing. His acting feels very natural especially when we compared each of his scenes. Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz did very well to complete the angles and give nuances to the movie. Jane Fonda did well in stealing the scenes even with her short screen time. 0.15799019607843137\n",
      ". . . are that \"Melanie Ballinger\" is far scarier than any Gentle Ben grizzly bear, and Jane Fonda comes awful close to upstaging Leo's bruin in the fright department herself, not to mention Harvey Keitel and Paul Dano. When \"Hitler\" places as just the fourth creepiest character in a flick, you know that that picture has a lot going for it. Ask yourself this, as well: Did REVENANT feature a well-endowed full-frontal Miss Universe? Or a command performance of a haunting tune for the Queen? Or a dozen amazing live acts on a turntable? Or cow symphonies? Or a Daddy\\Daughter nightmare-in-bed scene? Or violin lessons? Or massage tables where happy endings are not foregone conclusions? Or existential fights for survival where the combatants are fresh and clean, NOT scruffy and infested? Or a dying fat man able to volley a tennis ball off his ankle?

They meet various people and reflect on their current lives.\"Youth\" is visually very beautiful. The scenery is beautiful, the resort is beautiful and the sets are beautiful. Every scene is well thought out and beautifully composed. However, that's really the only good thing about it. There is not much of a story present, only characters mumbling away through the film. The four other people I went to the cinema with had no idea what the story was about. There is no central message, no plot to unfold and nothing to engage the viewers. I wish I didn't watch it. 0.3132352941176471\n",
      "Italian director Paolo Sorrentino has crafted an art house film full of metaphor and overwhelming symbolism. Thank goodness that the two leads give Youth the gravitas it needs to make it's moral impressions.Fred (Michael Caine) is a famous retired composer who is on vacation at a fancy resort in the Swiss Alps with his best friend Mick (Harvey Keitel). Mick is a film director who is there with a team of young screenwriters while writing his next masterpiece. When Fred is asked to come out of retirement to conduct his music for the Queen of England on her son's birthday, he and Mick begin to contemplate their age, legacies, and the passage of life around them.The film is written and directed by Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) and his touch is an eccentric one, as he weaves his way through the resort and spotlights small moments by the other guests and the staff, giving a sort of outlandish Upstairs/Downstairs feeling to the movie. The guests are all rich and famous in some way (a decadently dressed couple who never speaks, a retired and extremely overweight athlete, Miss Universe, a levitating monk, etc). The staff is made up of very young and bored looking people catering to their wealthy guests in grey polos. Sorrentino is not a very traditional storyteller, and the way he jumps from one subject to another can make you forget certain plot points; by the time you get back to the main characters you might have to scramble to remember what happened with them last.When Mick does something out of the blue and extremely out of character, Fred and everyone at the resort is thrown for an emotional loop. Fred's daughter, Lena (Rachel Weisz), asks him what they would talk about as friends- did he see this coming at all? Fred says they only talked about the good things, never the bad things. Begging the question, do you really know someone if you only see the lighter side of them? Is it in the darkness of our friends and loved ones that we truly get to know them?Keitel and Caine have wonderful chemistry as two friends who have grown in fame and fortune together. They talk about being old, about how they were when they were young, and how the youth don't know how great they have it. The film is filled with reflection of once upon a time greatness. Mick believes he still has great movies to make while Fred is done with music and wishes to live his last days out in peace. One man refusing to accept his prime may have passed and another who is happy to let it go. Their light and humorous talks ground an otherwise detached and bizarrely structured film. Abstract and dreamlike, Youth is a study in age, wealth, fame, and best friendship. 0.24197063805759458\n",

      "Paolo Sorentino's Youth isn't one of those movies that aim to be something else... It is a statement about life in the form of incredibly realistic paintings. Above all things, the movie isn't about the characters or their story, about the hotel or the beautiful setting in Switzerland, it isn't about Mick's movie or Fred's concert. The movie is simply a exposition of the opposition between elderliness and \"YOUTH\".The photography is pretty much impeccable and as I said every frame looks like a painting, I mean, ANY still of the movie would look amazing in your living room wall. The hand of the director appears in many of those shots that you can only say, \"Oh my\"... And it is pretty much only production design and camera... The only two times you see special effects, they kinda suck...About the acting... I don't think there's much to say... Lately, in the non- blockbuster flicks, I watch Michael Caine and just see him doing his thing... Pretty much as him playing himself... And he's good, even very good, but there's not that spark that makes it a \"brilliant performance\". I feel the same way about Harvey Keitel. Rachel Weisz was good, but I don't think her character was so well constructed, Paul Dano's on the other hand had the most interesting character of the whole movie and was impressive as Jimmy Tree. Jane Fonda received a nomination to the Golden Globe, but she was on screen for two scenes only, so... I don't know...The movie was pretty much about the visual and left the story to be read between the lines (or between the frames)...The story is pretty good but the movie is not about it... Is just a way of expressing an idea...At the end of the day... Paolo Sorentino will be indicated to every award for directing, this season... The movie is a work of art, but not to much as cinema indeed... 0.2880607769423559\n",
      "I'm going to keep this simple - I think. I don't know how to describe this film. One reviewer hated it, said it had no structure and indeed it is a bit dis-structured in conventional movie terms. I have no patience for a crappy film, I watched this right through and loved it. It's a movie in scenes, you're always wondering what's going on while little by little it draws you in. I love and appreciate film, characters especially and everyone is superb. The characters are studied and close up. If you're a \"Fast and Furious\" fan you most likely will not like the film. It's an inner film, lush and full, thought provoking. Each character brings quirky insights into life, experience, as you get know them, their life. I haven't told you what the movie is about - read the cover. Warning, it can only give you an idea of where it takes place and with whom. A film on this level can only be watched in order to know. In the end I was left stunned.

      "Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Jane Fonda star in Youth, an introspective film from Italian filmmaker Paolo Sorrentino (La Grande Belleza). Mistitled, you say? Well, the film is more about perspective and reminiscence than youth, but Sorrentino's melancholic point is that it is our youth that define our subsequent perception of the world around us; we see everything through a filter made up of all our previous experiences. The friendship between Keitel, an ageing director, and Caine, a retired composer, is the narrative and thematic focal point of the film, but it's the wonderful use of music and the many artistic compositions that is Sorrentino's biggest achievement here. He may not have anything ground-breaking to say in the end, but he's able to create a rather wondrous backdrop for us to take a step back and look at life from a different angle. And there are a few laughs in here as well, most notably through a fantastic spoof on football icon Diego Maradona, played by Roly Serrano. 0.23541666666666666\n",

When dealing with film-making on this level the increments of mastery are so close together they can be safely ignored.Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano head the cast. All are superb, with Caine in particular excelling - it's not at all surprising that he has won the European Film Award for best actor. May it be one of many such accolades for this performance.What is perhaps particularly astonishing about Youth is its immense sympathy for those who are twice the age of its director/writer.

      "« Youth » is a complex drama by Paolo Sorrentino about Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine), a retired orchestra conductor, who is on holiday with his friend Mick Boyle(Harvey Keitel), a film director, in a luxury hotel in Switzerland for stars and famous people in the show business. We watch them as Fred, who is asked by one of the Queen of England's emissary to perform again despite refusing to do so ever again, is trying to deal with his daughter and wife's issues and as Mick is trying to write what will be his last important film.I don't really know if I have enjoyed it or not, as it was sometimes quite hard to understand as well as hard to keep up with what was going on as there was also a sub-plot developing. However, I liked that the film included many incidents relating to the pair, including Fred's daughter (who is married to Mick's son) splitting from her husband, as it allowed us to get a well-rounded view of the characters' personalities as they responded to each incident. I also liked the fact that it was giving us a glimpse on how you feel when you get old and you feel like you've done everything you could have possibly done in your life. As the main they do in the film is talk, it gives us a better understanding of how they are working through their situations and it allows more characters to wander in and out of the story. Although there were some moments of complicity between the women portrayed in this film and the main characters, I didn't enjoy how they were pictured as either needing men in their life to be successful and as being incapable of being independent or just being beautiful but therefore being stupid.I'd recommend the film to perhaps an older generation who can more closely relate with such a story. As a teenager, I was sometimes confused with the different directions the film was taking and the different stories the characters were introducing, perhaps as I haven't had the opportunity to live some of the experiences that the characters discuss. Overall however, the film was compelling and nicely integrated the plots well, creating an emotional, 'overwhelming' film. 0.23244206773618536\n",
      "There are three main film elements here that run in different directions.1. The characters were the wealthy elites in an exclusive resort without everyday cares that us plebes in the audience have. No sir, their concerns are maintaining great art as an octogenarian, or gossiping about other lives.Michael Cain is a superb actor, and he can do class characters, but every time you think the film is going to mock its bourgeois characters, it glides along on gilded slippers to the next serious scene.The sexism was par for the course of a male written/directed film - the women characters were weak. Although Jane Fonda did not take any prisoners, and 'Miss Universe' was stunning, naked or not.Harvey Keitel's character was a film director/writer unable to write a good movie, which seemed meta as the director/writer of Youth wasn't able to overcome the same problem.2. The cinematography was technically excellent, and a mash between high fashion and MTV. It screamed ART! Some scenes were trying to look like Fellini, without his flair or humor.3. The dialogue was sometimes pithy and erudite, but too often it was wannabe-philosophical drivel. I think it is a class problem. How can a writer deliver the meaning of life, when his characters are the wealthy elite and his aesthetics fly first class? My partner and I laughed at the dialogue occasionally because it was so gag-worthy.What I did like was the choppy scenes/editing that didn't flow with one another and even the bad surreal sequences. That gave the movie some avant-garde punch.Two scenes were excellent - one were Michael Cain conducts a symphony with the cows - it was magical and unfortunately, too short; and (Spoiler Alert) the last scene where he conducts a real orchestra with superb singer Sumi Jo. Wow. 0.2175925925925926\n",
      "YOUTH is Sorrentino's much-anticipated follow-up of the Academy winner THE GREAT BEAUTY (2013), an English-speaking ensemble piece set in a posh resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a retired music maestro, he is on vacation with his best-friend-cum-in-law, Mick Boyle (Keitel), an esteemed woman's director brainstorms with his group of screenwriters for his final testimony, an ambitious work tailor-made for the prestigious actress Brenda Morel (Fonda), who is discovered by Mick over half-a-century ago.Fred and Mick are friends since childhood, but now both reaching 80, their world-view cannot be more different, Fred is relentlessly apathetic towards his work, he refuses multiple times to the request of Queen Elizabeth to perform his most famous piece \"Simple Songs\" for Prince Philips' anniversary, and rebuffs a proposal to write his memoir and asks to be forgotten by the world. While Mick, still enthusiastically integrates with his writer-quintet to finalize the script of his swan-song, a supposed masterpiece for the audience. Yet the two pair harmoniously with their daily pee competition and jostle for memories of their past.There are other characters, Lena (Weisz), Fred's daughter, experiences a one-sided breakup from Julian (Stoppard), Mick's son, who leaves her for Paloma Faith, the real-life British pop star (whose CGI music video is just too surreal even in for a Sorrentino's production). Paul Dano plays Jimmy Tree, a young actor eternally acknowledged by his most popular role, a robot, and prepares for a new role as Adolf Hitler, which will examine the real driving force that propels him to strive in the business. Also, the overweight Maradona (Serrano), a new Miss Universe (Ghenea), a young masseuse (Mijovic) and a mountaineering coach (Seethaler), all leaves their inkings in the narrative.But is Sorrentino's ostensibly life-contemplating poshness makes him an auteur of our times? The answer is moot at present, one might be too cynical to call him a poseur, but I suppose an outstanding tableaux artisan is more appropriate right now, no one can deny the imposing beauty of his artsy compositions of his shots and the exalted gratification of his ear-friendly music preferences, yet, as a screenwriter, his dialogue is either cliché-laden or overtly vying to be a dictum, all the best parts are those without words, apparently English language and narrative is really not his strongest suit.Headlining a glamorous cast, Caine restrains a poised existence against the world around him, his frosty side only breaks down near the end, after the suicide accident (which pales in comparison with IDA 2013 in the same abrupt fashion), and his eventual compromise betrays a tough man/husband/father's unwilling resignation of his conviction. Keitel has always been a character actor wanting a certain gradation of versatility, his two-hander with Fonda tellingly proves that, he is barely able to retort back in the assumed tit-for-tat show-piece which serves as their Oscar-bait, however his last line is greatly moving \"emotion is everything\", eventually he is a martyr for his belief, after the fatal betrayal and he lets his emotions to reign over his life for the last time.It is easy to understand why Jane Fonda is hyped for an Oscar nomination here, she plays a two-times Oscar-winning diva, basically a larger-than-life version of herself (or is it?) with ridiculously heavy make-up, it is the most showy performance among the cast, but frankly, it is a five-minutes cameo, can she pull off a Beatrice Straight in NETWORK (1976, 8/10)? I highly doubt that will happen, as much as I want to see Fonda back in the Oscar podium, it is a long shot, but one plus side is that her role is right in the target for Oscar voters, a coattail nomination might not be a far-fetched dream. As for Weisz and Dano, doesn't have enough fodder to be the showstopper here.Sorrentino is a smart filmmaker, who plumps for stories about the privileged class, where Academy voters clearly belong, and making them feel relevant and contented about the fading memories, about getting old, about mundane pettiness and about nostalgia, without being perceptively incisive, that's why he has succeeded with THE GREAT BEAUTY, YOUTH unwittingly exposes him as a one-trick-pony, the second round is less admirable, but still passable to watch, yet I cannot say for sure for a third time, let's wait and see if I am right or wrong, and I do hope there will be a quantum leap to prove I am wrong. 0.1541514714241987\n",
      "The only other film I've seen from the director is The Great Beauty, and while I thought that was a very handsome, very visually striking film, it did nothing for me in terms of getting me emotionally invested in any way to the story. This film did, to an extent. It had me invested a bit, but then it would lose me, only to get me invested again and so on. I think as a meditation on life it works better in a way than The Great Beauty did. The performances here are nice and nuanced, with Michael Caine giving some great work late in his career. It's a refreshing film to see, simply because it is felt more than it's about anything happening with the plot. I do recommend it, although I do have reservations with it. 0.3483333333333334\n",
      "\"Youth\" is a movie that was released very recently and was written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino. He did some television and short film work since his Oscar win for \"La grande bellezza\", but this one here is his return to full feature films. It runs for slightly over 2 hours, slightly under without the closing credits and stars Michael Caine as the main character. With people like Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano and Jane Fonda, this film is a lot more Hollywood heavy than everything he has done before, except maybe \"This Must Be the Place\". The title \"Youth\" is certainly an ironic one as this film, just like his previous project, is a lot about aging and life during its last chapter. This should come as no surprise to anybody for Caine is in his 80s and Keitel in the second half of his 70s.All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Caine was good from start to finish and I usually like him. Keitel I am usually not so big on and maybe that is also why I found his story not too interesting. As a whole, the film has some moments during which it drags and it's also on the fine line between artistry and pretense. In my opinion, they could have certainly kept it at around 100 minutes if they had gotten rid of some of the scenes I found rather dragging. Then again, maybe accidentally, they would have cut some of my favorite scenes and that would have sucked. There were certainly a couple really good moments in here, especially in terms of writing and in terms of Caine's delivery. I liked the scene when he admits that he is only good in terms of music, not in terms of giving essential advice to his daughter. Brutal truth, but there was something pretty raw and authentic to that confession.Sorrentino always has his very unique take on female characters and how they are perceived through men's eyes. And a character like Weisz' was not there in \"The Great Beauty\", so it's nice to see Sorrentino trying to develop in new areas. I also liked how the concert was used as a way for Caine in order to deal with the pain of losing his wife, which was certainly still there, but also in a way of saying goodbye and not shutting out this great opportunity because of his loss. There are a couple funny moments, but these are at their best when they are subtle, not really when they are talking about the quantity of their urine in the morning. All in all, it is probably a film that will appeal more to older audiences than to younger ones, but by no means it's a must-watch for older audiences or a must-not-watch for younger ones. Especially Caine fans should check this one out as he, once again, shines in here. However, the awards attention for Jane Fonda (what are you thinking, Globes???) is a bit of a joke mildly speaking. Overall, a decent watch and I recommend it. 0.20048453008979322\n",
      "To say that Youth is a little odd would be a bit of an understatement. But not odd in a bad way , odd in a very , very good way. I absolutely loved this film. This is the story of a retired orchestra conductor ( Michael Caine) on holiday in a lavish retreat with his daughter and his film director best friend ( Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives an invitation from the Queen to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. In all honesty this isn't really about the invitation , it's about getting old and how you reflect on life so differently than when you are younger. This looks fantastic . Sure it can be classed as a bit arty but director Paolo Sorrentino hasn't gone over the top with it instead he has got Michael Caine , to produce one of the best screen performance I have ever seen him perform. There are a few surreal moments that don't quite fit , like the cameo from Paloma Faith which seems to have been shoehorned into the film just to get her on screen but on the other hand I loved the scene with a fat Diego Maradona doing keepy uppies with a tennis ball. This won't be everyone's bag but it got me big time. 0.23625\n",
      "Director Sorrentino has become somewhat of a household name since his Il Grande Belezza strolled through awards season in 2013. Now, two years later, his new film Youth graces theatre screens everywhere. As the title suggests, it deals with 'youth', though wasted youth is the better term. All the action takes place in and around a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps, as we see two old men coming to grips with their pasts and desires.Composer Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) are spending their holiday--as always--in this resort. They are not the only residents: Ballinger's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz); actor Jimmy Tree, who in Birdman-esque fashion is only remembered for one mediocre role; a couple that never communicates; a young boy who loves Ballinger's violin pieces, etc. They're also told Miss Universe will be arriving soon.The acting is one of the reasons the film maintains some semblance of momentum. Rachel Weisz and Jane Fonda shine in their short but intense scenes. Michael Caine is also quite good, though I always watch him with a certain emotional distance. Nevertheless, he is very good in the scene where he explains to the Queen's ambassador why he won't conduct his Simple Songs.Sorrentino deliberately paces the film quite slowly to portray the boredom and routine of the resort, how these people are basically sitting around with only their memories keeping them company. We get variations on these themes: Caine's relationship with his daughter, Keitel's relationship with his son and his desire to make a new film, Dano's fear he'll forever be remembered for something insignificant, a role in which the audience couldn't even see his face (aka who he really is). Sorrentino alternates slow-moving scenes with emotional outbursts, such as the short scene with Jane Fonda and Rachel Weisz's monologue. Because these outbursts are framed by slow-paced scenes, the emotional impact is increased. On the other hand, the stylized nature can slow things down to a crawl. Some of the dialogue can also be as subtle as a brick to the face. When the Dano character completes his character development, he utters the following: \"I have to choose, I have to choose what is really worth telling: horror or desire? And I choose desire. You, each one of you, you open my eyes, you made me see that I should not be wasting my time on the senseless fear...\" This couldn't be more devoid of subtlety had Michael Bay written it.My feelings on Youth can be summed up by watching the final scene. I won't say what happens exactly, but it involves an opera singer. She has a wonderful voice, but occasionally employs these hand gestures for added emotional effect, yet it just comes across as mannered. That's this film in a nutshell: there's plenty of content, but the film's stylized nature and deliberately plodding pace tend to undermine the emotional impact. It could've burst to the surface a bit more often. 0.08216567670056042\n",

      "Director/Writer Paolo Sorrentino (\"The Great Beauty\" Academy Award Best Foreign Film Italy 2014) once again brings his rambling film style to YOUTH, a film about a retired orchestra conductor (Michael Cain), his daughter (Rachel Weisz - \"The Lovely Bones\"), his director friend (Harvey Keitel) and a fellow \"retreat\" actor (Paul Dano - \"Little Miss Sunshine\"). That much information you can count on. For the rest of the film, one can only guess what Sorrentino was trying to say and why. Cinematography (Luca Bigazzi) is stunning, the various retreat performances are intriguing (if not bazaar), Jane Fonda gives and interesting cameo performance (not necessarily worth Award consideration), while Dano, who has little to do here, transforms into his movie character (no spoiler here) which is worthy of Award consideration.

You hear a band tuning up and then they start to play. Suddenly they cut to visual and the singer sings, the drummer plays.... only the singer is in focus, and they play on a rotating stage. One take and the tune continues in one take. Straight on, straight up, right on. And then cutting to Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) listening to the same tune that the band played. He seems little troubled over something... Cutting to Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) sitting in a garden being interviewed by somebody that apparently comes from the Royal Highness in Great Britain. Mr. Ballinger shows a little arrogance and fatigue with a high integrity and solid character directly. Very amusing! At the same time they focus in on a young man, Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), sitting at a table listening to the conversation between Fred Ballinger and the Queen's Emissary. A few cuts back and forth. And then suddenly a cut showing the whole garden and the young mans table is exactly centered and hiding the table between Mr. Caine and the interviewer. The whole scenery is just about perfect and my mind fly over to the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel. Fred Ballinger refuses to the Queen's desire and starts to play with a piece of plastic paper from a candy. Just by playing with the paper and the sounds from the paper you can hear the expertise from the conductor and the subtle music coming from a highly experienced conductor; the rhythm of drums and the rhythm of the whole orchestra. Mr. Ballinger's fatigue and his finished career and arrogance of the subject being brought up again and again is perfectly displayed by this simple manner... The Queen's Emissary says \"Gooday Maestro!\" and leaves. Mr. Ballinger remains silent and continues to read his paper and playing with the candy paper. Jimmy Tree gives a little nonchalant salute to the conductor (as in \"Good work, there!\") and Fred waves a little back... perfectly executed! There is so much going on directly in this movie that I just had to write this. These opening minutes is well planned, well produced, well directed, well acted and well accomplished... plain and simple great!

You will love it, or you will hate it. And now the words will be left out for you to experience the movie.Instant classic line from the movie (Jimmy Tree, Fred Ballinger, a boy and Diego Maradona speaks to each other. They talk about the fact that the boy is left handed.) Diego Maradona: \"I am also left handed!\" (instant silent moment) Jimmy Tree: \"Christ! The whole world knows you're left handed!\" Diego Maradona: \"Thank you.\"Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful cinematography! Very well written day to day dialogue. Sound recording with high class. The clarity of the picture deliver the sense of art that this movie has to offer. Sometimes a little bad sound editing where you can hear the in and out fadings before and after the characters lines. (Especially about 34 minutes into the movie between Michael Caine and Rachel Weisz.) The music is magic... Academy Award Nominee! Astonishing! - The actors : Competent with depth. Mr. Keitel and Mr. Caine together brings solid performances to the screen. - The story : Interesting. Exploring a hotel little like the motion picture Grand Budapest Hotel. Two friends having reflections over life and other things such as careers. - Entertainment : Great!

Two old men are of course acting a fine piece of craftsmanship, a composer, a film director, life-long friends find themselves disillusioned about life and old age and in turn react in different ways to this plight. Another extra dimension is the voyeuristic deployment of life in a five star hotel in Switzerland, its kings, the guests and their servants, the hotel staff.The well-to-do and celebs of this world find a retreat in exclusive fine hotels to find their bearings, to relax in the wellness facilities, a possibility to unwind in their hectic lives. Sorrentino has conjured up an impressive array of stars and talents, but this sometimes seems like a casting event. Overdoing the good thing: Maradona\" makes a surprise appearance as well as a Hitler impersonator. Sorrentino gives Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel a wonderful stage for their (dirty) old men phantasies and memories of the past. The composer Fred Ballinger was notoriously unfaithful to his wife Melanie, who put up with it, only to end up as a demented death mask of the only person he really loved in a psychiatric ward in Venice. His daughter confronted him with his past, his emotionally starving her, his unfair unfaithfulness. Fred, being retired, is apathetic, once directs a herd of cows mooing and the sound of their cowbells. He refuses to have his memories published, refuses stubbornly to conduct his Simple Songs\" for the British Queen, who sent an emissary, speaking the Queen's English, who seemed to be unsuccessful in convincing Fred to perform just this once more. At the end of the movie we can see him complying blandly, but with great success. His scenes with his daughter, who was just abandoned by her young lover, who preferred Paloma Faith to her.are very moving. The dialogue has some very open discussion of love, sex and marriage, there are scenes of outspoken passion of great intensity. Some great takes are performed by young talents, the young masseuse, Paul Dan (Jimmy Tree) who played a young blasé actor whose ennui of being identified with just one film role is quite understandable and well done. Then there is this young girl who absolutely astonishes the former with her quip.Nick Boyle, the famous film director describes his dozen or so films all as crap\" and is seen working on his last film project The Last Day in Life\" which is portentous because he ended his life after Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda ) told him just that in very outspoken terms.He had prided himself to be a women's director\", in Wiesen\" (place name meaning \"meadows\") he sees dozens of his women characters in a dream-like scene, all talking to him, complaining, whispering. His entourage is seen brainstorming for film ideas, all to no avail, the ending of the film is still missing, the main woman character suddenly shows up, calling Nick destructive, repulsive, a failure. Both pretend to have furthered the other's career.Some delightful scenes show philosophic questions being raised, dis- cussing old age, youth, love and marriage, fame, wealth. The two old friends have their fun and games, telling each other only the good things\" in life, playing tricks (mostly on Nick) and both complain of amorous and urinary problems . 0.15954301075268812\n",
      "I realized that this film doesn't need to be nitpicked or \"profoundly\" understood. The thing is this: it gave me a glimpse at what old age is. I felt old, for real. When everything you've ever done seems to be so far away, when it's meaningless you're left with so little. But of you've played out the little things through your life in the right way, they are significant and don't cause you to die with regret about what you've missed. And those little things, although the biggest in life but look little in comparison to the stupid goals we set upon ourselves, are our relationships. Value people, be true, love them and be what you have to be which is often different from what you want to be.

      "This movie is set in a Swiss wellness hotel. It's summer, and the mountain scenery is beautiful. The hotel (as grand hotels tend to do) has a rhythm and character of its own.The guests are performers, many of whom are struggling with past glory. They are withdrawn from the world here, and the director captures the beauty, limitations and artificiality of their retreat.Two of the guests, Fred and Mick, are elderly, and the movie focuses on them, especially Fred. (I must say Caine and Keitel played these roles extremely well.)Those who require action and a forward-moving plot may not like this film so much. If you think about it, only two things really happen in the film (although I'm not going to disclose them here). The rest of the film was a complicated portrait of a particular place, specific people and a certain theme.This cinematic portrait was painted with meaningful dialogue and beautifully filmed scenes. The scenes are varied and surprising -- sometimes surreal, sometimes whimsical, sometimes profound, sometimes banal.This idiosyncratic non-Hollywood movie has profound things to say about old age and life in general. I'm not sure that younger people will really get it. Art, fame, memory, beauty, love, the very meaning of our lives... It's a difficult movie to review because I'm not sure I've grasped everything. I've only seen it once. I suppose one message is to lead your life to its fullest, even in old age. Move forward, not back. Feel, don't talk.The beauty of the movie, the intelligence of the dialogue and the astonishing character development hammer home the movie's points in one devastating scene after the next.I thought the final song at the end would bring it all together, and after looking at the lyrics, I suppose it does. It is too moving for words. I have to see this movie again, but I'm almost afraid to go. This movie caught me at a vulnerable point. 0.06083638583638585\n",
      "Youth is a realization of an intricate and funny magical realism script by Paolo Sorrentino, the director, exploring the rediscovery of passion in life. The story focuses on an aging and retired music composer, played by Michael Caine, and his friend, a feature film director working on what may be his last opus, played by Harvey Keitel. Every frame of the film is carefully composed and uses light, like a brush...one moment could be reminiscent of Raphael nudes, the next Dali. The story, set in an elitist spa in Switzerland, dallies in that lush landscape, pairing it with vistas and grottoes of water, highly paid for fountains of youth, where sirens bathe and old men ogle. A friend saw the nod to Fellini's 8 1/2. I saw an auteur with fresh and unexpected expression, as if Bergman spiced one of his early works with the Chinatown Kung Fu film tradition. Original, unique, a film you don't want to miss, and a certain 2015 Oscar contender in multiple categories. 0.16907563025210084\n",
      "Another reviewer said either you love it or don't get it. I found it boring, confusing at times and much too long. It says it's a comedy / drama. I saw no comedy at all. It was hard to figure out at times what was imagined and what was real. I did not understand why/how some of the characters were in it either. I first thought the ending was imagined because he was hell bent on not performing for the Queen. It was one of those movies with good reviews that I kept watching, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. 0.0708333333333333\n",
      "As I indicate in the summary title, this is on the one hand a profoundly \"Continental\"-style film, even up to the Swiss mountain setting; and so it is full of intriguing and at times gorgeous visual impression, enigmatic happenings that pass over into the surreal from time to time, and such an overwhelming desire to be \"meaningful\" that it may readily be accused of straying into over-analysis. Great Polish Director Krzysztof Kieslowski - who also came close to the above threshold, but somehow still stayed successfully below it - once noted that film was not an especially useful medium for telling stories, illustrating this by asking how many minutes (hours?) of film you would need to convey one line from a book: \"he gradually came to see her less and less often, and eventually stopped seeing her altogether\". In similar vein, a sparser way of dealing with issues raised in the film \"Youth\" could theoretically be reduced to a single, 8-verse Louis Daniel Brodsky poem, or even simply to its ever-memorable title \"If Youth Knew and Age Could\" (admittedly said originally by a 16th-century Frenchman, and also later by Sigmund Freud). However, ... and this a big \"However\", the cast and acting of this film give it a British feel, or at least a trans-Atlantic one given the partnership of the film's key senior citizens, Brit Sir Michael Caine and Yank Harvey Keitel. While the latter actor has always been a firm favourite of this reviewer, the former has seemed a bit of an acquired taste. But with this film the acquisition process is complete. For me this would be Sir Michael's greatest ever performance, even if it is - in essence - just more of Michael Caine, albeit now Michael Caine as senior statesman of the film world, here beautifully devoid of any hint of that old, class-related \"chip on the shoulder\". Here he finds a niche, and his straightforward understatement conveys ideally the version of growing old that says \"I've kinda had enough really, given what life has thrown at me, but I'm accepting because there's absolutely nothing I can - or even want to - do about it\". This contrasts ideally with the more driven and up-beat Keitel as Caine's best friend and regular holiday companion. Indeed, the pair are \"almost related\" given that the daughter of Caine's character (an effective Rachel Weisz) has married the son of Keitel's, giving the film one of its several intriguing-enough plot devices. Both of these key male characters are artists - Caine a famous and sophisticated conductor and musician, and Keitel a prolific and sassy film-maker. Both are in essence past it, though the Caine character has no doubt about that, while the Keitel character has difficulties with the concept. As the film progresses, the two deal with these circumstances in quite contrasting ways (I'll write no more on that). On the way, there are numerous interesting and touching (and occasionally hotly erotic, farcical or shocking) juxtapositions of youth being able to but not yet knowing, and old age knowing but (largely if not wholly) not being able to - in the sublimely beautiful, yet above all staid and ordered and \"safe\", setting of a posh if oldie-worldie Swiss hotel for the very well-heeled. Overall, this film verges on the pretentious, and certainly would pass the boundary were it not for the Brits and Americans to drag it back down to Earth. But this makes for a rather new approach that in my view works quite nicely. The two key actors move us without even trying too hard, simply because they are now old men, let's face it. But the pairing is an extremely effective and convincing and joyous one. However, those choosing to see this film might wish to have at least hinted to them that a very great deal of the success here depends on its very last, closing scene - a profound and extremely powerful contrast with the rest of the film, if also a natural consequence of it, and one that will prove truly breathtaking for at least some of those who watch it - a real treat in store for the patient... 0.19745462140198974\n",

I do not understand how it has a rating as high as it is, Of course as a small art film, it has probably had a certain type of self indulgent audience, who see what is not there.

This is a movie about feelings, about reflection, about the past and memories. Therefore, if the Great Beauty is a masterpiece of allegories but, sometimes, assumes a very Fellinian look, this movie gives space to the contemplation and absorvation of the audience, and puts this movie, for me, in another level.

      "Michael Caine is yet another one of a small select group of actors who always turns in a great performance and will make any movie he appears in feel a bit special. He is now in his 80's and some of my other favourites, such as Pacino and De Niro are not too far behind in the age ranks. I'm not too sure who is going to replace them in my affections when they finally call it a day - probably no one.The last Caine film I saw was the excellent Harry Browne, in which he plays an avenging, retired marine. The part suited him down to the ground. I am not convinced that Caine was perfectly cast in Youth, although the old trooper pulled out all the stops and delivered his usual blistering performance.Caine was, is, and always will be a cockney. He is pretty good at American accents and he had a wonderful upper-class British accent in the film that made him - Zulu. But in Youth, Caine plays the part of a world renowned, retired maestro - an orchestral conductor on a par with Barbirolli or von Karajan. I'm sorry, but dear old Michael, however hard he tries, doesn't quite pull off the right accent. He wasn't a Malcom Sergeant - not even a Colin Davis. He tries to speak in an educated middle-class accent, but to me, his cockney strains still came through.I doubt if the director, Paolo Sorrentino, who also wrote this fine movie, even realised the problem existed - after all, he's not English. I know Caine was supposed to be a bit of a rough diamond, but how rough a diamond can you be if you have lived and breathed the world of classical music for your entire life. I can't see anyone's cockney accent surviving that. But I guess it's only the English who will notice it.The film's screenplay was very original and the film was beautifully made. Together with Harvey Keitel, who plays an ageing film director, Caine is holidaying at an exclusive upmarket Swiss hotel in the Alps. The hotel caters for the rich and famous where healthy food and exercise is the order of the day. We have a female British pop star (Rita Ora), a very fat Maradonna look- alike, a real Miss Universe, a high-class escort, and many more diverse characters, most of them young and beautiful.Caine is visited by the Queen's equerry, who asks Caine to conduct some of his own compositions for Prince Philip's birthday. He declines - twice. Keitel is surrounded by a ragbag trio of young impecunious screenwriters who are helping him to complete his latest screenplay. The two octogenarians also have their respective son and daughter with them, who are married to each other; but the Keitel's son dumps Caine's daughter soon after the movie starts. So what are all these people really doing there and how do they interact with each other? Will Caine eventually change his mind and agree to conduct for the Queen? Will 'has-been' Keitel get his script finished and will he get the money to shoot it? Will the arrival of feisty Jane Fonda as Keitel's leading lady change anything? Then there is Caine's estranged wife - who is dying.The film quite clearly has Italian roots. There's some titillating nudity and a few doses of 'rumpy-pumpy' to spice things up a bit, along with a healthy dose of surrealism and a lot of laugh out loud, witty humour. It is about two successful men at the end of their lives, thinking back to the days of their youth. It is also about the youths themselves and the intense, fleeting relationships they have with each other. It is a masterpiece of film-making and it will leave you feeling entertained and uplifted. I can't explain why - it just does.My wife, who is Thai, couldn't make head or tail of what was going on, but that doesn't surprise me. She struggled mightily with the dialogue - which is at the heart of the film. In any case, there's no discernible plot in the traditional sense, it's far too Italian for that",

      "I hope everybody has a good friend with whom he talks only of the lighter things in life and not the troublesome, profound stuff. This film is not that friend, but it is about two men subjectively at the end of their life that are this friend for each other. It is about important relationships with one another (family, friends, strangers) and oneself. These relationships form the outline of a life lived despite its inescapable death. Certainly, not every scene touches everyone the same way, but I rarely saw a movie with so much emotional backlash because of little scenes, like the conversation about riding a bike or the metaphor of the looking glass. I will remember them dearly. 0.10636904761904761\n",
      "The heart of Paolo Sorrentino's Youth lies in the lead composer Fred Ballinger's (Michael Caine) most famous work, Simple Songs. The queen will knight him if he conducts that number in a concert for her Prince Phillip. Ballinger refuses because he wrote it for his famous soprano wife Melanie to perform and she's gone. Not dead, we eventually learn, but frozen into a silent scream.Ballinger is embarrassed by his fame for that simple composition, instead of all his weightier works. Sinilarly, serious actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano) is regretfully best known for his heavily costumed role as a robot in some special effects trivia. By disappearing into the robot his disappeared his serious work.The film is woven out of such paradoxes. That is, it's a stab at capturing our complex reality of life. Like Ballinger's signature piece, the film is a simple story — a mixed bag of folks at holiday and rehab at a luxurious hotel/spa in Wiesel (i.e., \"pointed\") in the Swiss Alps. But everything simple is complex.Ballinger feels that he can only relate to music and admits to having neglected his wife and daughter Lena. \"You were right. Music is all I understand.\" But he remembers his tremors when he fell into love at first sight of Melanie. His current detachment expresses his pain rather than the apparent lack of feeling.His buddy film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is scripting his testament film but with his screenwriters is bogged down on the ending. In his Eureka moment he will allot the deathbed speech to the dying man's wife, not him. But the film dies when that actress Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda) pulls out of the project, their 12th together over 53 years. She first explains she needs the money from a TV series she's been offered so needs to prefer. But she goes on to declare his career dead, his last films crap, in a cruel candour all offered — of course — in the name of friendship. Love and hate bubble together there.In a chillingly expressive shot, on the left side of the otherwise black screen Fonda's old, veined hand talon-like caresses the sized Kettle's cheek. That's Jane Fonda's hand!?! The film is titled Youth but, paradoxically again, it's about the old, the sere not the juicy. But here youth and age are the same telescope. Through one end it's youth looking at the future in closeup. Through the other it's the past, galloping further and further away.With Pamela's withdrawal, Boyle knows his project is dead but determines to start another. In his last scene with Ballinger he says \"You say that emotions are overrated. But that's bullshit. Emotions are all we've got.\" On that he strides out to the balcony and jumps to his death. Shattered in guilt, Pamela runs amok in the airplane and has to be bloodily subdued. With his gesture Boyle refuted Pamela's disrespect: \"C'mon, life goes on even without that cinema bullshit.\" Another \"simple song\" here — bitterly comic but sombre.Sorrentino gives the film's last shot to the dead but beaming Boyle. That is, he gives the last silent word to Boyle's faith in emotion. When Ballinger conducts his simple masterpiece for the queen he tears up over its emotional force. Against Melanie's silent scream Ballinger proffers his musical articulation of his ardor. It speaks for as well as to everyone. As in the film's last \"simple song,\" over the end titles, he's in full content and out of control.So the composition that seems simple but beautiful turns out resonant and profound, especially in full orchestration. That's the funny thing about life: the simple is so complex. Conversely, as the young girl compliments Tree about one off his serious films, he taught her that the big things in life are essentially simple. Everybody doesn't have a clue what they're about — so it doesn't matter. As Ballinger early told Boyle, \"Levity is also perverse.\" Not here. Here the light is how we handle the heavy.Hence too the tension between the intellect and the senses. The young masseuse speaks of the understanding that only touch can give. Ballinger is proud he never became an intellectual. The screenwriter scenes are a parody of literary creation. On the other hand, the sensually rich Miss Universe reveals an astonishing intelligence, dissolving that antithesis. When Boyle hires the plain looking young hooker just to walk with him, he seems to be buying an emotion not a sensation. When we see the girl's mother seeing her off to her \"job,\" Sorrentino seems to encapsulate the tradition of modern Italian cinema (as embodied by Fellini). The girl carries the neorealist exploration of poverty into the contemporary spa's opulence.Another moment of historical resonance involves Tree, who is at the spa studying the people for clues to his next role. We finally learn his character when he appears in costume, freezing all the white-clad dinners — as Hitler. Tree pulls out off his project because \"I have to choose what is really worth telling: horror or desire? And I choose desire. You, each one of you, you open my eyes, you made me see that I should not wasting my time on the senseless fear",
      ".\" Mutatis mutandis, that could be Pamela's reason too. As desire trumps horror both Boyle and Ballinger nurse charged memories of a childhood attraction to the same girl, unconsummated so ever fresh in their mind. 0.05584346963423049\n",

      "After his big success with \"The Great Beauty,\" Paolo Sorrentino is back with an English language version of essentially the same story. In place of Toni Servilo as Jep Gambardella, an aging Rome journalist facing a mid-life crisis, we now have Sir Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a slightly older composer who also finds that he's stuck in a rut.The setting here in Youth is a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. The inciting incident resolves around an invitation from a representative of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for Ballinger to conduct his most famous piece, \"Simple Songs,\" at Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Wouldn't you guess but Fred, the curmudgeon that he is, refuses, citing a lack of interest in pursuing music as a career at this late date.There are other assorted characters at the resort including Ballinger's daughter, Lena, winningly played by Rachel Weisz. Lena works as her father's assistant but is also married to the son of Ballinger's good friend, Mick Boyle (played by an impressive Harvey Keitel), an aging filmmaker who also appears to have lost his mojo. When Lena is dumped by her husband she goes into a tailspin until she finds romance with a strange guy with a beard, a mountain climber, also at the resort.Meanwhile Fred and Mick trade stories about women they used to know, particularly one who they both had an unconsummated relationship with. Unlike Fred, who still is talented, Mick has seen his better days, deceiving himself that his latest film which he is working on with a bunch of young screenwriters, is a \"testament\" of sorts.Other odd characters show up including Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree, a frustrated actor remembered only for a commercially successful but aesthetically bankrupt role as a robot, Roly Serrano as a very overweight former soccer star Maradona, Luna Mijovic as a young masseuse who imparts sage advice to Fred, and Madalina Ghenea as an enigmatic and alluring Miss Universe who catches the eyes of both Fred and Mick while bathing.Despite Keitel's efforts, he's unable to do much with the character of Mick, who turns out to be a real sad sack, particularly after his long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (sensationally performed by Jane Fonda), changes her mind about acting in his latest project and instead has agreed instead to act in a new television series. Brenda's decision results in (super spoilers ahead) Mick's suicide.Ballinger's story is equally downbeat as he continually reiterates the fact that he's no longer interested in music mainly due to his invalid wife being unable to perform the part he wrote for her. Whether it was Mick's death or a visit to his wife who we find out has dementia (or a combination thereof), Ballinger rather predictably changes his mind, and ends up accepting the Queen's invitation.Jep Gambardella's epiphany in The Great Beauty appears better thought out than Ballinger's, and the characters and situations in general are more compelling than what Sorrentino has proffered up here in Youth. Sorrentino's regular cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, continues to impress with all kinds of sensational shots and Youth is certainly worth watching for the visuals, instead of the feeble story.One wonders if Mr. Sorrentino really has much more to say about life in general. Fred Ballinger's reclamation is hardly something to get excited about after experiencing all his downbeat ruminations throughout a narrative which was told much better in Sorrentino's earlier and much more impressive masterpiece. 0.1923761423761424\n",

      "I want to talk about Melanie (Fred's wife). There were so many themes explored throughout the movie. The most captivating for me was the subtle build up throughout the movie to Fred's wife fate. Even in the scene towards the end of the film when we first see her, we know only so little. Fred starts talking to her, we see her from away. And little by little the camera moves and we see the true state of her face, the terror in her eyes, the million screams that she is producing inside of herself. We see her face once again during the last recital of the \"Simple Songs\". Which makes her a symbol, in which all the aches and harsh realities explored so far can be expressed.We know from Lena (Fred's daughter), from a previous scene, the type of life this woman was living, the sacrifices she was doing. Wasting the good years of her life knowing that her children have no one but her, while her husband is completely absent. She experienced unbearable \"anguish\" during her life.But all of that is one thing and being in that final state of hers is completely terrifying. What despair and hopelessness she must be feeling? One automatically assumes that people in such state are not fully conscious or feeling a peaceful sadness. What if she is completely conscious. I keep thinking about Paloma Faith's horrifying screaming scene in the airplane and that a much worse screaming and feeling of terrible anxiety is happening inside Melanie's head. I was completely brought to a state of terror from the thought of what is going inside her mind. -0.007083333333333307\n",
      "Is the fact that I immensely liked 'Youth' a sign that I am getting old? I can tell you (and I will tell you) a few good reasons 'Youth' is not a masterpiece, and yet, I resonated and was really moved at several moments while watching this film.Take for example the scene when the emissary of Her Majesty comes for a second time to invite retired composer and conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) to perform at the anniversary of Prince Phillip a famous composition of his called 'Simple Songs' ('it's the only music he likes'). The daughter of the musician, Lena (Rachel Weisz) is present and the camera moves so that she turns from background to close-up. We will understand the scene by her emotions. The old musician has refused firmly the invitation 'for personal reasons'. The emissary royally insists and asks details about the reasons. The daughter understands, she is on the verge of breaking into tears. The old man answers 'my wife is the only one who was performing it perfectly and she cannot do it any longer'. Close up on the daughter crying. One of the most beautiful declarations of love that I have seen on screens for many years.The location of the story is a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a place of relaxation and recovery for the ultra-riches of the world. Some of the scenes that describe the daily life of the place look like a tourism promo, but there is enough irony to balance the super-aesthetic view. In the mid of the hinted celebrities, in between a cinema star that can be a Matt Daemon or a Leonardo DiCaprio refueling and a Maradona at the pick of his overweight decline, we meet the two old friends - the musician and film director Harvey Keitel who tries to find an ending to his 'testament movie' together with a team of yuppies script-writers. The two share memories - remembered and forgotten - as well as an attitude that tries to cope with their own personal decay. Is this a symbol of a broader decay, the one of the society they come from, the falling in oblivion of a way of life, but also of a way of making art and relating to art? This is one of the possible messages that I read in this film.The acting of the two old masters - Caine and Keitel is superb. Jane Fonda makes one apparition that is worth waiting for. There are a lot of funny moments in this film, there is melodrama, and real drama. A feeling of melancholy envelops all the story, the same type of melancholy that I sensed in The Great Beauty (which I liked less) and to some extent in This Must Be the Place which was one of the most original Holocaust stories that I have seen. Overall, 'Beauty' confirms the huge talent of Paolo Sorrentino in making films with emotional stories and characters that are both special and sometimes eccentric, but also deeply human. 0.19930952380952383\n",
      "Director Sorrentino has been accused of being ostentatious in displaying his talents. In the case of this movie I say that if you've got it, flaunt it. Sorrentino utilizes all of the potential of movies--music, sound, cinematography, acting, and dialog--to create a satisfying whole.The story is of two aging professionals on vacation at a resort in the Alps. One of the two is a retired composer and conductor and the other is a currently active movie director. The conductor/composer is Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and the movie director is Mike Boule (Harvey Keitel). The Alpine resort itself is a major character and a feel for the place comes from short takes, like a brief glimpse of a row of bodies sunning themselves, people lining up for a sauna, or nightly stage shows. While Sorrentino has his own style, it is clear he has taken some pointers from Fellini. There is a dreamlike quality to many of the scenes. I never know who deserves credit for such effective camera work, beyond the director and cinematographer there is probably a whole team to thank. Anyway, Sorrentino has a feel for the medium that I find most pleasing.Music plays a significant role, befitting Ballinger's profession. There are some elegantly choreographed scenes. Luna Mijovic plays a masseuse at the resort and I was captivated by every scene she was in. She does some dynamic interpretive dance numbers--the scene that ends with her crossing her arms across her chest as the music fades is beautifully done. The final scene that has soprano Sumi Jo, violinist Viktoria Mullova, the BBC Concert Orchestra, and the Berlin Radio Choir preforming Ballinger's Simple Symphony #3 is a real knockout--it alone makes the movie worthwhile. I backed up and watched that scene several times. The original score by David Lang is impressive. Most movies about a fictional composer usually have some generic compositions, such as \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" but Lang's score adds some real depth here.The main focus of the story is on Fred Ballinger. Initially, by his own admission, he is a disengaged spectator of life, essentially serving his time until the end. But he cannot ignore his innate appreciation of sound. First it is the sounds a candy wrapper makes when rolled between a finger and thumb. Then it is cowbells and cows mooing in a meadow, and then a young lad at the resort playing his violin. Finally he is reengaged as a conductor in the final scene. I found that following Ballinger's gradual reawakening to be moving.The acting is uniformly good. It's nice to see the two old pros Caine and Keitel in good form as well as a strong cameo performance by Jane Fonda. The prostate jokes could have been cut as an improvement. 0.23477891156462585\n",
      "Paolo Sorrentino continues to create exquisite works of art, and Youth is his latest offering. Retired orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and over-the-hill film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) vacation to a luxury hotel in the Swiss Alps, where they postulate love and loves lost. The scenery is charming and the camera-work skilled. The supporting performances are strong, especially that of Paul Dano, who is putting a nice little career together.The dialogue, primarily self-indulgent male existential crisis, regret, missed sexual exploits, and cultural critique, is both serious and satire. Softly floating around the edges of life's larger questions, it finds comfort in the minutiae, imparting wisdom gently without taking itself too seriously. Youth is an honest portrayal of how shallow and simple man is, regardless of station, exposing his insecurities and shortfalls in a funny, intelligent, and beautiful way. 0.2838333333333333\n",

I've just done a preview of what I want to put into the review and it appears I have to write at least ten lines of text, which is going to be difficult because a few hours after watching this film most of what occurred has simply been eradicated from my memory. All I can remember about it is a series of disjointed, seemingly unconnected scenes with nothing at all to link them. I first thought with a powerful cast list that it was bound to be an enjoyable film which just proves how wrong anyone can be.

      "Comparing to 'The Great Beauty' this movie doesn't have a dynamics of the previous one, everything is in slow motion and therefore seems more depressed. Recognizable aesthetics is colorful with plenty of different, interesting details, scenes and characters. Some of them are actually playing themselves which contributes to the sense of reality. The manner in which Sorentino used light, focusing it just on the person in absolute darkness might be inspired by Carravagio and baroque painting - a metaphor of hope, but also of the death, according to general belief that at the moment of one's death light is to be seen. Also the eternal question of the meaning of existence (life, work, creativity, success, marriage, children, friendship, love), which becomes more often with ages, is emphasized in the nice way. The unexpected reversal at the end, the man who was enthusiastic about the future in his old age loses hope and commits suicide and the other, declared as apathetic turns toward life is how Sorentino allows hope and optimism to win at the end. 0.25034722222222217\n",

Some of the dialogue is about the ending of a movie planned in the movie. Good news that one won't be made.Performances are subtle as in wasted. The exception is a tea bag drop in of Jane Fonda who has a great three minutes. Of course she like everything else in the movie is more then slightly askew. There was no need to rip her wig off as if the audience didn't know it was a wig.There are good moments. The conducting of the cows was fun. The mass of the directors leading ladies on the hillside was interesting.There is an annoying redundancy including crackling of red cellophane and one to many shots of the wife at the windowIt is always amazing that movies that are too long and too slow have time for a complete song before before the fade out to slow overly long credits.The movie is in limited release and you'll be lucky if it doesn't come to a theater near you.

It's just sad and insanely boring set of shots that vary from mildly annoying to flat out disgusting.Apparently it was supposed to be a study of aging. The movie presents a bunch of 'secondary characters' (young aspiring filmmakers, conductor's daughter, miss universe with disgusting silicon tits, queen's emissary, some young actor, a freaking buddhist monk) and it throws this interesting pack into beautiful hotel located in Alps to sit and talk about life and death. The main characters are 2 old farts. One grumpy ex - orchestra conductor and second retiring filmmaker. One is old and bitter and he doesn't want to perform anymore, because of some personal tragedy, the second is still kicking, but he eventually gives up too after one of his muses resigns from being in his last movie and the guy jumps off the balcony and I was supposed to care, but I didn't, because this movie was so disgusting and boring that I almost fell asleep halfway through it...I wouldn't be so negative if there was some artism included in this piece.

      "Gaspingly pretentious portrait of characters at a resort hotel and spa in the Swiss Alps. Michael Caine is a British widower and retired symphony conductor--an annual guest at the spa for some 20 years--who refuses a request from an emissary of the Queen of England to conduct again for Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Caine's grown daughter is temporarily staying with him; she's distraught over her recent breakup with the son of another guest, screenwriter Harvey Keitel, an exercise-friend of Caine's who commiserates with him over their combined years and non-working body parts. Other guests include a rock-climbing instructor, a film actor, assorted child prodigies, a beauty contest winner, et al. Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino has a grandiose visual concept, which he makes clear within the film's first 10 minutes; however, his artistically-composed shots of naked, sagging bodies (usually slumped over in states of depression, inert in the steam rooms or floating aimlessly in the swimming pools) are not especially pointed or amusing. The shots call attention themselves, probably to distract the viewer from the lack of substance in the writing (or interest in the central characters). Caine, pinkish-white like a rabbit, seems to look out at the world with bleary eyes--but is this the character or simply the actor in bad physical shape? Keitel doesn't appear very spry either, but the worst is saved for Jane Fonda (in a bad blonde wig) as a jaded, foulmouthed actress just in from Los Angeles (she asks Keitel expository questions to set the scene: \"How long have we known each other, Mick?\"). \"Youth\" flatlines at the one-hour mark--with another 63 minutes on the clock. * from **** -0.12272727272727271\n",

The Queen's Emissary arrives asking Fred to conduct his most famous composition Simple Songs for Prince Phillip's birthday concert. The contrasts between apparently happily retired Fred and Mick, who is having a hard time of making his current movie provide interesting contrasts, and Caine and Keitel look like they genuinely enjoyed working with each other on this one. Rachel Weisz as Fred's daughter Lena has some success at linking apparently unrelated scenes.But mostly there are long moody silences with gorgeous Swiss backdrops, hotel entertainers struggling to captivate their onlookers and sequences that seem to provide little except bemusement about what they were about and why they were there. Every now and then we get some light relief in the form of voluptuous naked women, tantalising scenes in swimming pools or forests, pop song video clips, Adolph Hitler and an overweight soccer player demonstrating that a big belly can assist in juggling a tennis ball with your feet.It struck me there were too many ideas, and the spa hotel setting makes it easy for other guests to appear without rhyme or reason.

I also do not understand movies about Westerners living in a beautiful health spa feeling sad about their lives. I mean, what do these people have to be sad about?The plot was interesting. Two oldies (Caine and Keitel)roam around a Swiss health spa ruminating about the lost opportunities in their lives and spying on other people. The sub-plots include a depressed actor (Paul Dano)preparing for a role. The character reminded me of Bill Murray's in Lost in Translation. There is Caine's daughter (Rachel Weiz) and Keitel's son who are seeing each other but break up. It was an interesting setting, Paolo. And Madalina Diana Ghenea made me press rewind - the film did have quite a few nude women. The rest of the movie made me want to fast forward despite the visual splendor.The writing often gave the impression of being uninspired or contrived. There are quite a few references to levity by Caine's character. Caine's daughter who is ditched by her boyfriend and then falls for a mountain climber is shown kissing him while hanging off a cliff towards the end of the film. A Buddhist monk levitates.

I kept thinking while I watched this sharply cut piecemeal movie that it was very much like a metaphor for contemporary cooking where the plate has a dab of three or four sauces daintily spotted around the plate with small serves of the main course: it no doubt appeals to some but not to my taste.

The film seeks to dramatize his awakening and his rediscovery of youth!What a crashing bore!Caine's character of Fred Ballinger has a daughter named Lena (Rachel Weisz), who serves as his publicist-manager. This character made no sense in the film because Fred had retired and he was fending off a British delegate from the Queen to return to England for to conduct a performance of his magnum opus of \"Simple Songs.\" For the coherence of the screenplay, the daughter should have been negotiating with the delegate. Instead, she has no action or relevance to the film, other than to make the father even more callous and unsympathetic. The film included a set of cardboard characters whose dialogue sounded scripted.There is also a parallel plot about a film director, as played by Harvey Keitel, who is in the process of conceiving a film that is to be his swan song. Of course, the subplot permits the filmmakers to explore the highbrow theme of \"art representing life,\" and so on...ad nauseam.

      "I had high hope on this movie when I started watching it. Unfortunately, I still could not figure out what I was hoping for after watching it (with some fast forward). It's very slow (because the men are really old?). And there is no dramatic drama throughout the entire story. It's not funny either. There's no any logical connection among the characters. My recommendation: don't waste your time on this movie. -0.02883333333333334\n",
      "Kudos to those working on art, set and cinematography. Short of that this an almost comical waste of time. It feels like you are watching the product of a 19 year old film student given a huge budget and talented actors who has never left his suburban basement and has no idea what he's doing. Enter the adult crew who run around trying to save the poor actors from suffering eternal embarrassment by at least creating beautiful imagery. All of the one star reviews nail the adjectives - pathetic, pretentious, etc. Though I will say that this film would be great on mute in the background of a dinner party with some nice music playing: some great imagery. 0.1558823529411765\n",

      "Not one of Sorrentino's best - he does like his 'one central character focused, pensive, slow flowing sentimental' pieces but this one fails where others don't, mainly because he's gone down the Woody Allen route of trying to pack in as many big names and random celebs as he can at the expense of a real script.Paloma Faith's appearance is nonsensical, Keitel's character sounds like his teeth are falling out, Weisz's hysterical daughter act does nothing for the film, and I don't buy anyone's relationship with each other...it all seems so contrived while trying to be clever and deep, but without any real content.Michael Caine is the saving grace, his performance is superb as always but overall the script and his co-stars let him down. -0.006725146198830416\n",

      "At its best, \"Youth\" grabs his ideal of grandiloquence with pure cinema moments. It can get gorgeously evocative, like having an old Maradona thinking about his pre-match warm-ups. \"What are you thinking about?\", he´s asked, and he answers \"the future\". As eloquent as it can be it´s also too vague and two hours can become tedious. Maybe too sentimental as well but nostalgia is the engine after all. There´s nothing wrong in missing past times.

      "Extremely decadent movie that seems to be made by a child who wants to appear and be noticed at all costs... full of 'great' characters, nudism and stereotypes... wants to surprise with very common and not at all original things, where the only beautiful ones are the few dialogues of relationships between parent and daughter.

You can categorize me with the second option, I didn't think much of it and could not wait for this movie to be over. I've just been lured by the names of the cast. Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine are both actors I really like and even in this movie they do a good job with their acting performances. The filming techniques are also excellent, nothing bad to say about that. The nature scenery from Switzerland are also nice to look at. So why would I rate Youth below average? Because when I watch a movie I need to be entertained, the movie has to have an interesting story, a story well told. And even for drama's that are not necessary my thing the story has to be interesting, and sometimes it is. But with Youth I didn't get anything of that. It's a long boring story about basically nothing. Too bad because you had all the right ingredients to make it a good movie.

      "I don't mind long or slow, and many great works of art are pretentious. I also don't need relatable characters or believability. But I can't abide laziness or bad faith. Laziness: The script needs something to happen so Fred will conduct his concert. So...Mick suddenly jumps out a window...more or less for no other reason than the script says he must. Suicide is not a prop. Was it hard to write or act some appropriate reaction to the suicide...the script just skips over all that. And somehow the suicide because the pivot for Fred to change his mind and play for the Queen. Why? Fred articulated his principle. \"Personal reasons.\" If those personal reasons are now null and void, some higher principle must apply. Bad faith to get the audience to admire the character for passing up an opportunity out of loyalty, and then to have us admire him again for taking the opportunity after all.Many reviewers here see the main theme as aging, as the title suggests, but the situation of the creative artist seems even more central. But, bad faith, what Fred and Mick have to tell us about art making seems incongruent with the movie itself. Unless perhaps...the point is to admire Sorrentino's bad taste because any viewer who makes it through the film is overly intellectual (as per the remark attributed to Stravinsky). An anthropologist from Mars might watch this movie and conclude that for earthling art is nothing but one possible path to celebrity. Yuck. -0.014311594202898532\n",
      "This movie is perfect in so many ways and I hope it will win everything it can win, from the bottom of my heart. I haven't seen such a beautiful Italian movie in so long. And to think it's Paola Cortellesi's first movie as a director and co-writer makes it even more special.It is amazingly written, directed and acted. It's brave, powerful, original and you NEED to watch it. It tells a dramatic story with bittersweet tones, keeping it extremely real and revolutionary.I am Italian so I could obviously understand all the homages and nuances, however I am sure an international audience will appreciate this little gem in a whole.Go watch it and you won't regret that. 0.32400793650793647\n",
      "This is a masterpiece, a surprise because unexpected. Brilliant story based on true events, but full of symbolisms and deeper meanings that are all connected on the final scenes of the movie. Great directing and acting by Cortelesi, but also great choice of the characters and performancefrom the other actors. The women's universe in Italy back then was complicated and the road to the recognition of their rights was full of obstacles, with many dramatic stories happening. The movie manages also to be ironic and there are moments you laugh. Then suddenly it becomes dramatic again and you want to cry. Then you bacome angry. All these fluctuations are captivating, meanwhile represent the reason why Paola manages to give a powerful message through the art of cinema. 0.15492424242424244\n",
      "Very interesting debut: a mix of comedy (one-liners), drama (domestic violence), romance (love and friendship). The correct ingredients for a wonderful result. Rome in black & white appears too be a little \"didactic\", like a good \"copy\" of old times (just after the 2WW), but pleasant and very faithful to the original one. Delia is a woman like many others, in a common enough situation in those days. The final twist, which slowly makes its way, amazes and exalts the viewer. A spontaneous applause rose at the end of the movie, in a suburban cinema, in Rome. The same Rome that Paola Cortellesi makes us regret. 0.20473484848484852\n",
      "'C'è ancora domani' (2023 - English title is 'There Is Still Tomorrow') is a directorial debut but it does not look at all like one. It can be said that it is also an author's film, because the director is also the co-author of the script and also undertakes the main role. Paola Cortellesi is in Italy a household name, actress and singer, nominated and winner of numerous awards, especially as a singer. With this film, feminist plea and homage to post-war Italian neorealism, Paola Cortellesi has a good chance to add some new awards in other categories. The film is already the biggest box-office success of Italian cinema since the pandemic.Delia and Ivano are a poor couple in Rome in the years after World War II. Italy is occupied by American troops. Hope can be felt in the air after the defeat of fascism. The first democratic elections are approaching, but the economic conditions are very difficult. Ivano works, but the couple needs to take care of a sick father and three children, of which Marcella, the eldest daughter, is approaching the age of marriage. Marcella (at the cost of dropping out of school) and Delia are forced to work to supplement their income. They are not a happy family. Delia's efforts are not appreciated by Ivano, a violent and vulgar man who becomes even more dangerous when he gets drunk. When Marcella is about to get engaged to the son of a rich cake shop owner, things seem to be looking up, but is this boy the right choice? Isn't Marcella also at risk of being chained into a marriage dominated by a controlling man? Delia dreams of running away, perhaps with Nino, the unfulfilled love of her youth. The meeting with an American soldier who, despite the language barrier, understands her and agrees to help her at a critical moment, as well as the advice and complicity of a friend seem to hasten the moment of liberation. But fate also has something to say.The opening scene already tells us that we are dealing with a special film. Paola Cortellesi shoots in black and white, which is obviously a hommage to American neorealist cinema. The streetscape, the interior of the houses, the clothing of the characters are accurately reconstructed. And yet, from time to time, the rhythm of the story is broken by directorial interventions that want to be as visible as possible: slow-motion footage; dance or mime scenes in which the feelings of the characters and the relationships between them are expressed through the expressions of human bodies and not through dialogues; finally the soundtrack in which are interspersed songs completely out of sync with the era, from light Italian music to new contemporary hip hop. This last trick is the most debatable: it certainly makes the film more interesting, but it seems to put directorial concept in the foreground. Such a decision is dangerous in a melodrama, be it a social one, because it risks killing the emotion. The actors fulfill their missions precisely, starting with Paola Cortellesi in the lead role, continuing with Valerio Mastandrea in the unsavory role of Ivano and Romana Maggiora Vergano who is beautiful and expressive in the role of Marcella. The ending places the whole story in a larger context, which of course will please all feminists - women and men, myself included. This meeting between neorealism and hip hop results in one of the most interesting European films of 2023, a film that we may meet again in the awards season of 2024. 0.04469181612038754\n",
      "This movie is a masterpiece, acting, screenplay, direction, photography, music. All perfect. Everyone should see it because this movie will remain in the history of cinema.Mass phenomenon in its country of origin, Italy, becoming the most watched film in the last 9 years in the country, beating Barbie and Oppenheimer in 2023.Paola Cortellesi's first work, it doesn't seem like a first work given so much mastery in this movie. It is no coincidence that the director took 2 years to make it and it can be seen from the attention that Cortellesi put into the details.Costing 5 million euros, it grossed 40 in Italy and almost 2 in France. 0.33125000000000004\n",
      "A truly meaningful film. It portrays a naked and raw mirror of Italian society in that specific historical period. Best performance in Paola Cortellesi's career who portrays a strong and determined woman who in her own way tries in a resilient way to carve out her own space. Excellent performance also for Valerio Mastrandrea who portrays a harsh and violent husband. Film that I hope will be shown in all schools. Probably some dialogues could have been handled better as well as the episode of the American military policeman. Overall in Italian cinema it remains a unique work of its kind that I appreciated very much. 0.20163322185061314\n",
      "In this film is represented the history of the fight for gender equality. No room for tears despite the dramatic subject . Director Paola Cortellesi chooses black and white for her debut feature film thus evoking images from Italian Neorealism while matching as close as possible the period in which the story is set. There are no scary scenes but the drama unfolds under the constant thread of physical and psychological abuse. In order to avoid any unpleasantness every violent moment is turned into a figured dance. Italian women, in this movie, are mainly mothers worried about the future of their daughters and every choice Delia takes is aimed to improve her daughter future life: rather than lingering in plans of personal revenge she indulges in dreams of a better future for the whole female gender. Many funny moments give levity to the drama and tragedy gives way to humour.Paola Cortellesi 's way makes us laugh of this sad period of our history and yet no unpleasant detail is omitted.It was a great debut! 0.05480769230769231\n",
      "Great film about the hard life of an Italian mother of three, in 1946 with the Italians struggling to recover from the war and their mistakes. Even the pasta is short. As in not available. The daughter wants to marry a son of a bar owner, considered a step up. The diner where the two families meet is a hilarious scene. You constantly wonder how long Delia is going to put up with her aggressive husband, his complaining father she has to take care of. She scrapes the money together, enjoys solidarity from female friends, who cheer when they assume she finally has started an affair. She indeed has two silent admirers, but the ending is not what you would expect it to be. Shot in black and white but a very daring and warm movie, with great music too. From sweet Italian pop to hiphop. 0.1442982456140351\n",
      "Ms Cortellesi's debut as a director is amazing, as she is known in my country as a comedian, and she surprised most of us with the amazing all around talent.Maybe being Italian, watching it in its original language and knowing a lot about the period the movie is set in (remembering my grandmother's recollection of life during WW2 in Rome and afterwards) made me appreciate it more than other viewers.Loved the way the movie is shot, black and white gives it a very special feel, and the settings of a Rome of 1946 are great.Obviously the most talked to spect of the film is the abuse and violence that too many women took (and sadly some still do) as normal in their lives....What really got me and I loved is the twist of the real \"purpose\" of what she is hiding... we think that she is running away with a man that appreciates her to start a new life.... Instead she is risking being beaten again by hiding the fact that she is going to vote with millions of other women that had the right for the first time in our Italian history and changed the course of our country by choosing democracy over monarchy.... Awesome 😊 0.25602904040404045\n",
      "An engaged, feminist and civic-minded film: a gem! Dealing with a serious and heavy subject that, even if the story takes place after the war and is shot in black and white, painfully echoes what far too many women still suffer nowadays. The musical scenes are both off-the-wall and perfectly in tune with the story, making you smile with tenderness or shed a tear of sorrow. Intensity all the way through, with a mind-blowing end that is so meaningful... BRAVO!Incredible performance of Paola Cortellisi in front and behind camera. I hope the International worl of Cinema will hear more from her work in a near future. 0.060784313725490216\n",
      "There are so many great aspects to this film, starting from a very precise depiction of 40s Italian families, moving on to the scene where they danced symbolising a toxic love which was the standard back in the days where all men where playing the machist role and concluding with a very powerful scene, where the daughter finally understands why the mother was letting everything and everyone step on her head and it was only for the love of her kids, which she didn't wanna leave with the tyrannical father.In addition to all of this, the sarcasm is fantastic, Mastandrea and Fanelli are stunning in their roles such as the director/actor of the film and the Italian soundtracks are amazing! 0.2858823529411765\n",
      "Unorthodox yet stylised, with even the choreographed domestic violence enhancing this charming film to become, well, even more charming! A gentle comedy levens the narrative with the shared chocolate scene a stand out moment. The brooding presence of Ivano is a constant even when this particular male monster isn't on screen. There's an excrutiating Sunday lunch where a potential engagement may ensue that is pure tragi-comedy, and is perhaps the fulcrum of the film but for me it's the various women who are the real stars of this film, which is totally appropriate given the near perfect ending and what the letter ultimately reveals. Oh and post war Rome in sepia is a wee bonus too. 0.27849702380952385\n",
      "The film describes the life of a lower middle class family in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Rome, just after the liberation of the capital. We have the husband ( Valerio Mastandrea ), the wife Delia ( played by Paola Cortellesi ), the father of Delia's husband and father-in-law ( Giorgio Colangeli ), we have a grown-up daughter, perhaps eighteen ( Romana Vergano ), who is unusually mature for the age and with a strong and determined character, we then have 2 young children aged 7/8, full of life and healthy selfishness, carefree, who are always playing. There are also neighbors gossiping in the courtyard where they sit to chat and do small jobsAlmost the entire first part of the film is dedicated to describing Delia, the mother of the family, who is always active: she gets up first and prepares breakfast for everyone; she then goes for injections, she does some sewing and mending work, she makes her own clothes at home, works in an umbrella factory, then she goes shopping, and prepares lunch.However, we don't know much about the husband, for example we don't know his profession, we only know that he enters the house to criticize or beat his wife, then goes out and goes to have fun with friends at the bar, or elsewhereI really liked the description of neighborhood life, for example you see Delia walking on a wide sidewalk and as she walks you see many other activities that are carried out outdoors: for example we have people cutting hair, or shaving, people selling baskets of flowers, people doing small jobs or small repairs. The description of the environments and the climate of those years is perfect and thanks also to the \"black and white\" the film recalls and is linked to the neorealist tradition of post-war Italian cinemaScenes of violence within the home are always announced as thunder announces a storm; in this case children are removed, the windows are closed and the curtains are drawn, a sort of isolation is created, and then a dance begins between the husband and wife filled with acts of violence towards the woman. The slow motion ballet makes the scene grotesque and tries to represent the gesture in a less brutal way, which however remains extremely serious.The \"clue\" scene is the invitation of the future in-laws to an official lunch; the tone of the narrative always remains very light and comical \"gags\" are often included, for example the scene of the meatballs being hard and almost inedible for the future son-in-law's familyIn conclusion, a lower middle class family on the outskirts of Rome in the post-war period is described; with great realism, rather than thinking or talking about politics, this family thinks above all about scraping together the means of sustenance; I think the choice by the Italian ruling class of those years to avoid extremist turns and to try to recreate a nucleus of national cohesion was very wise\n",
      "They were restless years, people often kept their weapons from the civil and partisan war and there was a strong tendency to take justice into their own hands; at the same time there was the disintegration of the institutional apparatus, of the police and public order forces whose functions were carried out by American soldiers; however, there was also a great desire to do, to rebuild and improve, a great desire for freedom, peace, hope for a better future. In that same period and still in Rome, Rossellini filmed \"Roma, open city\" on the last acts of the Nazi occupation in Italy; there were no means of public transport such as buses and rail connections were poor; the grain, the main source of sustenance, had to arrive by ship from the United States and was stored in port silos, in the cities many houses had been destroyed, the streets were full of rubble and many people lived in wooden shacksThe empathy that the spectator feels towards the female character, that is Delia, is remarkable and the emotional involvement in the story is pleasant; we have the pleasure of witnessing the reconstruction of a period of our history and above all, an extremely positive fact, it is the images that tell the story, as it must be when the expressive medium is cinema. 0.1478165213781652\n",
      "This festival winner is, indeed, without a doubt one of the better films of the year, and yet another incredible start to this great movie season indeed.The actors all do an incredible job, very dramatic, emotional, yet with a humorous flair to it. All of this accompined by an incredible script, very subtle, unique and unconventional - incredible writing and pacing, and all around a career defining affair.The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, and the black and white style very much adds to the tone of the film, very unique and beautifully put together.Overall, definitely a masterful achievement, and one that is highly recommended for any lover of film! 0.3529583333333333\n",
      "This film is really good and he has a great subject. I like the black&white effects who gives the ideas the film was realised before the first colour film. The scenario uses euphemism for the violence and it's cool to see how they use this for us to understand the action of ivano. It's cool to see how Italians speaks in the original language and how they speaks with their hands. In this film we see how the women lives just after the Second World War II and how they obtain the vote right. The message of this film is really important and we can think about the life conditions of the women in this era. 0.3130952380952381\n"

      "I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts as an actress and so I approached this movie with trepidation but I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. Not only that, but Julia Roberts was excellent.  I don't think I've ever seen a Roberts movie where she had this commanding a screen presence.  Her physical presence may have helped in that regard but so did her acting. But man, she really looked good in this movie. Oh, and Albert Finney displayed some pretty solid acting skills as well even though he didn't look good. Overall, I'd say that most people who watch this movie will probably find themselves cheering for Erin and will be very satisfied with the film. I was. 0.3\n",
      "I must admit i wasnt too keen on watching Erin Brokovich for a couple of reasons.One is that i am not too keen Julia Roberts or more to the point the type of film she stars in I.E Pretty Woman the other reason is that i presumed that this film was mainly for women. I was wrong. This is film would appeal to everybody. It has charm, humour and a very good story and the acting from all quarters is top notch. Julia Roberts also looks superb, she has the best legs in Hollywood !. I'm not sure how true to life her character is but i would love to see if the real Erin Brokovich is as up front and speaks her mind as much as the one in the film. 8 out of 10. 0.31344444444444447\n",
      "Based on a true story of tenacity and humble beginnings, this film follows Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in her stiletto-clad stumble through the challenges of scraping by to pay bills, raising her children and catering to the whims of whiny boyfriends. It is clear from the beginning what a haphazard balancing act Brockovich's life is, opening on her painfully awkward attempts to make a good impression through an unsuccessful job interview, where we learn that she is an unemployed single mother of three. Wallowing in her defeat only long enough to smoke a single cigarette, she makes her way back to her old orange car, which has since acquired a parking ticket, and almost predictably is T-boned at an intersection minutes after leaving.The ways in which life is stacked against Brockovich are revealed gradually through her meeting with a lawyer in order to sue the driver that hit her, and later the disastrous cross examination in which her fiery temper and colorful diction cost her the jury's sympathy and her chances of winning any reparations for her pain and suffering. In her impatience at the defense lawyer's suggestion that she saw his wealthy client as an opportunity to capitalize on a lawsuit, it is clear that she is familiar with the ways in which power dynamics sway to favor the opposite of everything she embodies. Now confronted with the failure of her lawsuit, Brockovich is set back further than before, and forced to be even more driven and resourceful in her methods of obtaining her next paycheck.In this desperation, she turns back to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), demanding a job at the law firm in a grand show of shouting and refusal to leave, expressing that he owes her something for false promises and the failed lawsuit that left her in even more debt. When it becomes clear that Brockovich will not take no for an answer, Masry offers her a position as a file clerk. It is in the midst of this tedious paperwork that she discovers suspicious details of what was supposed to be a simple real estate case, which sends her on an investigation of a scheme bigger than she could have imagined.While the film was inspired by the story of how Brockovich investigates the ethics of the insidious corporation Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and touches on the intricate workings of the legal system, its strength lies in how deeply it appeals to the viewer's emotion, strategically taking the time to zero in on the struggles Brockovich faces in her personal life in order to humanize her, when on the job her abrasive personality could otherwise be off-putting. In the face of poverty, motherhood and romantic entanglements, it is clear how she grew to project a tough exterior for the sake of survival.Brockovich's home life is one device used often to make her more accessible to the audience, revealing the tension with her young children over the long hours she must work, and her dilemma between helping the families she represents in her case or focusing on her own family. A defining moment illustrating the struggle she faces as a mother is in an argument with her boyfriend (Aaron Eckhart), who feels that he is being neglected for her work and taking too much responsibility in caring for her children. In a decision rarely made in fictional stories, Brockovich chooses to prioritize her work over her romantic relationship, a powerful choice challenging the familiar trope of a woman realizing that love is more important than her ambition. This is a powerful, pivotal moment in the film.This film is more impressive than most in its portrayal of womanhood, Brockovich embodying a conglomeration of qualities which fictional accounts rarely conflate. It should not be groundbreaking to present a strong and intelligent female character who also has children and on top of this wears short skirts and high heels, but few other films with this type of character come to mind. And perhaps it is solely for the sake of remaining faithful to the true story on which this is based that her character was created with such dimension. Unfortunately, the other female characters in this film are disappointingly pigeonholed into familiar roles, deliberately contrasting with Brockovich in myriad ways only as a means to further glorify her and set her apart. There are the other women at the law firm who are mostly frumpy and overweight, and seem to regard Brockovich negatively based only on her fashion sense or out of envy. This reproduces the familiar but apocryphal idea that women are in constant competition with one another rather than being allies. There are the victimized clients she helps: rural, married and ignorant mothers who play the sympathetic characters. Then there is the other female lawyer, who, in spite of being on her side of the case, is portrayed as uptight and snobbish, unsuccessful in her attempts to connect with the working class community that the firm represents.This is the story of an underdog, a representative of a stigmatized group in our society: a single mother, twice divorced, and poor. Above all of this, she is unapologetic in her femininity, refusing to be shamed for her opinions, clothing choices or pursuit of justice. Although it has its weaknesses in succumbing to an uncomfortable number of clichés, the film weaves a heartfelt tale of determination and navigating the gray areas between work and personal life as a woman. I am confident that anyone more emotional than me (read: anyone) would have minimal critique of this evocative combination of comedy and drama, which culminates to a tear-jerking resolution, even more impactful given the fact that it is based on true events. In spite of a few shortcomings and my own nitpicking critiques, I would rate this film highly and recommend it. 0.09710586494484803\n",
      "Maybe this movie is not the right choice for action fans, but that is the only restriction of my otherwise fullest recommendation for this movie. It has everything, ranging from real-life documentary through love story via comedy to tragedy. And it is so lovingly done, and played so well. And it also has a wonderful soundtrack. To all the non-English Europeans: Get the DVD or original VHS, because the dubbed translated versions aren't quite like the original in terms of atmosphere created. 0.3595238095238095\n",
      "Julia Roberts deserves her accolades for the performance in this.  Has she been better?  Probably.  But not as DRAMATIC.  And that's what counts for awards.  As a rule.  This bit of work holds its own with brother Eric in \"Star 80.\"  Albert Finney has been better (best guilty pleasure performance? \"Wolfen.\").  And I must give credit to Aaron Eckhart (unrecognizable from \"In the Company of Men\") as the house-biker who takes care of Erin's kids while she saves Hinkley, CA (standing in for The World).  Oh, and, of course, nod to \"C.S.I.\" to Marg Helgenberger who was quite good.  Soderbergh has just been nominated for two DGA best directing noms for this film and \"Traffic.\"  Overkill.  Nominate him for \"Traffic\" and take another look at Hanson's \"Wonder Boys\" or Kaufman's \"Quills\".  Still, like \"The Accused\" and \"The Verdict,\" two other \"name\" performance-driven movies, this film does its job, effectively. 0.3841666666666667\n",
      "Despite being somewhat manipulative, despite being based on true events, despite essentially being a Julia Roberts' vehicle to the extreme, Steven Sodebergh hits a home run with his David and Goliath story. ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.Where most legal thrillers, in order to succeed, litter their stories with a slew of shady figures and double-crosses and plot twists, ERIN BROCKOVICH succeeds in sticking (like its heroine) to its \"little train that could\" story from start to finish. While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the \"big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism: it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether: TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own. 0.17271205357142855\n",
      "There's nothing dynamic or exciting about \"Erin Brockovich\" save for Julia Roberts' fiery, Oscar-winning lead performance. She plays the real-life single mother of three who gets a job in a law firm and proceeds to take on a huge corporation responsible for contaminating water in a Southern California city. The residents of that town aren't given any real shadings--we meet most of them on the fly--and Erin's co-workers and boss are a typical office bunch. Director Steven Soderbergh is offered no opportunities here to get flashy, but he does solid work up to the tag (which is silly). Roberts, on the other hand, gets to act all over the place, and it's nice to see her doing well in a role that requires more than just her movie star smile and figure. An interesting case which makes for an entertaining and emotional film. Five Oscar nominations in all, including Best Picture. *** from **** 0.16366213151927436\n",

Even though this is a 'true' story, the way that Erin behaves in the movie is reprehensible ... she treats all of those around her like utter crap and puts words in their mouths (notice that NO ONE in the film says that they think she is stupid, yet notice how she accuses all of them of doing just that).  I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?

Julia's strengths is her ability to play street-wise, honest, and passionate characters.  Erin Brockovich is all those things.The writing is dead on, making Roberts job easier, I am sure. And Roberts delivery of the lines was flawless. SHE WAS ERIN BROCKOVICH. Not that I have ever met the woman...Only in some places did the movie feel a little slow, I think perhaps, because of what the movie was about.

She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement.

      "Erin Brockovich Saves the DayErin Brockovich is a riveting film that will have you rooting for the underdog and hating large corporations that are out to get the little guys. This plot has been done many times before and in many instances, it has failed but not in this case. The film stars Julia Roberts as the protagonist of this film, Erin Brockovich. This film also stars Albert Finney as Ed Masry and Aaron Eckhart as George, who is Brockovich's love interest in this film. This film is based on a true story about a brave woman who goes against a huge corporation to pursue justice for others. Erin Brockovich is a single mother trying to raise her three kids. The opening scene of the film shows Brockovich desperately looking for a job so she can support her children and she ends up in a car accident. Jobless, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry into giving her a job at his firm. While working at the firm she begins to look into a real estate case involving Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E). She finds out PG&E is trying to secretly buy land that is contaminated by toxic hexavalent chromium, which they have disposed of incorrectly and has now affected the people living in Hinkley, California. The inhabitants of Hinkley are unaware that the land has been exposed to this dangerous chemical and think the company is solely trying to buy their homes. She decides to go to Hinkley and begins to question some of the people she read about in the files. As she talks to the residents, she digs deeper into what is actually occurring in the small town of Hinkley. She investigates further and soon Brockovich and Masry are involved in the biggest class action lawsuit case in American history against the powerful PG&E. Erin Brockovich is an inspirational film that will inspire you to do great things for the environment. She's a single mother of three, who without any formal education decides to go after a large multi-billion dollar corporation to help bring justice to those affected by the contamination of water in Hinkley. She was able to obtain the job in the law firm due to her tenacity as she convinced her lawyer to give it to her, which to me, says a lot about her character and how driven she is, which will help her as the film progresses. Despite her financial situation not being great, she still chose to help the people of Hinkley. This was a truly admirable act because she was fighting for a much greater cause. Even though she was not a lawyer, she was still an important asset in this case. I feel this helped the people of Hinkley trust her and bridge the gap between the lawyers and the clients. She was able to help the residents of Hinkley understand what was going on with the case in a way that they would understand. I think Julia Roberts did an exceptional job as Erin Brockovich. She was able to really connect with the character and it showed in her acting. This is a biographical film and I think it is vital that the writers don't stray too far from the truth and this film achieved just that. The costumes used in the film were great and helped bring a point across. The fact that she is working in a law firm brings a certain image to mind when it comes to the type of clothing you imagine employees wear and the clothes she wore were the exact opposite of that. Her clothes helped her stand out from the women in the law firm who wore pant suits and looked down on Brockovich because of her clothing choices. Even though the other workers were uncomfortable with the type of clothes she wore she did not succumb to their wills and she kept on dressing the way she wanted to. This action may seem insignificant but it really shows her refusal to conform to societal norms. The plot in the film is intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end because I wanted to know what the outcome of the case was going to be. Throughout the movie, you can't help but root for her and want her to succeed. She's a single mother going against a huge corporation because they did the people of Hinkley wrong. This really helps play on the emotions of the viewer. While watching the film I found this to be an admirable quality of hers. While there is an underlying romance in the film, it is not the main focus. The directors do an excellent job at not taking away from the plot and the story that is being told. I would highly recommend this film. The acting is phenomenal and the plot keeps you wanting more. After watching the film, it got me questioning the trust we put in the people that provide us with water. I'm sure there are many cases around the world similar to this and I think it is a topic that should be discussed more. This film really highlighted Brockovich's many admirable qualities and it inspired me. She was just one person who happened to stumble upon this case but that did not stop her from further investigating the situation and doing the right thing. The fact that she did not go to law school and yet achieved something great serves as an inspiration to us all. I think we all have something to learn from Erin Brockovich and we should continue to fight for things we believe in. 0.1761941798941799\n",

      "There are a lot of money lines in this smart drama about a woman directing a lawsuit against a big corporation that poisoned a community. One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.\"Law school!\" moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). \"At this point, I'd settle for charm school.\"Never mind Masry: \"Erin Brockovich,\" at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in \"Patton,\" albeit with a much different wardrobe.The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note: Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.Coates, who edited \"Lawrence Of Arabia,\" keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And \"Erin Brockovich\" contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.\"Brockovich\" doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that. 0.13720350829725828\n",

Anway, basically Erin Brockovich (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Julia Roberts, earning her $20m salary) has a car accident, and after failing to sue a doctor, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Albert Finney), to give her a job in compensation. No-one takes her seriously for a while, mainly because of her trashy clothes and language use, but that changes when she investigates a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. She discovers they are quietly trying to buy land contaminated by Hexavalent Chromium, a deadly toxic waste that is illegally being dumped and going into the town's water mains. This is a true story about one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-million dollar corporation, pretty much taken down by one woman.

      "One of the most awful movies I have ever seen, and certainly one of the most vulgar. I know why Julia did this movie -- to shed her \"goody-two-shoes\" image, but the result is less than appealing. I wonder how true-to-life this movie even was, but I'm sure any semblance of truth was \"hollywoodized\" out of existence.First of all, Erin's character has a vulgar, lewd mouth. She is so worried about spewing expletives at everyone, including her employer, I was surprised one of the women she works with did not punch her right in the mouth. Also, she says so many 4-letter words in front of her children -- what kind of mother raises her children with that kind of white-trash potty mouth? It was not impressive and did NOTHING to add to the story. The writers ought to be shot for making every other word she utters obscene and indecent.Because of her bad attitude and her vile mouth, is it any WONDER why nobody takes her seriously?? She thinks she ought to be praised for being arrogant, rude, brash, selfish and self-righteous? Give me a break. No employer is going to put up with that. Further, how is dressing like a scumbag whore going to earn her any respect from people? Where is the sense of reality here? How unrealistic can you get? It is wisdom to learn how to get along with people, but this movie seems to say that if you are vile, bitchy, rude, and obnoxious you will eventually come out on top. How phony and shallow is that? If Julia won an Oscar for this, I have to admit that the Film Academy has stooped to the lowest level they could. I accord the Academy no respect whatsoever. This movie is utter garbage. -0.057716049382716045\n",
      "Julia Roberts nailed this one. I have to admit all other Juila Roberts movies I've seen I really didn't like then I saw this one. The things that came out of her mouth were hilarious. She was definately worthy of that best actress award. I think it should have won best picture too but anyway. I would rank this movie in my top 10 favourtie movies of all time.

      "Erin Brockovich, played by Actress Julia Roberts, is an unemployed single mother of three who finds herself with her hands even fuller when she gets T-boned at an intersection on her way home from yet another unsuccessful job interview in North Hollywood. Although her lawyer, Ed Masry, is confident that she will win the case against the careless driver, their optimism turns to disappointment when the jury decides that this foul-mouthed divorcée was just trying to make a quick buck. This seemingly inconvenient event will ultimately propel her into the launch of her career, despite never having any formal education, or a job for that matter.Despite Erin's abrasive wit and eclectic wardrobe, she eventually lands a job with her former lawyer who introduces her to the world of fax machines and file cabinets. All the while, after having a run of bad luck with a couple of babysitters, her three young children are now being taken care of by George; the hunky bearded biker from next door. These relationships continue to unfold throughout the film. Erin's intuition and curiosity leads her to begin unravelling what was at first a dispute between a small family in Hinkley and the monstrous monopoly that is PG&E. After much investigation, Erin attempts to expose what could be one of the largest crimes of health and environmental negligence committed by a company to date. In the midst of chaos, she tries to find a balance between being a mother, a lover, and an appropriate employee all while attempting to find justice in a sea of corrupt companies and tedious judicial systems. Her astounding work ethic and ability to think on her feet is ultimately her only ammo in the unthinkable battle that precedes her.Set in Southern California, the Rom Com Drama based on a true story alternates between glitzy Los Angeles and the dull, barren desert of Hinkley. Julia Robert's ability to portray Erin as a beautiful, bad ass, and yet somehow still relatable character is the driving force of the film. Her and Ed, who is played by Albert Finney, create an unlikely yet incredible duo who will have you cheering from the sidelines. Erin's selflessness, sass, and zeal creates a character that anyone would root for, and the exposure of PG&E's negligence creates a very qualified antagonist. Her love interest, George adds another element to the plot, showing Erin's sweet and feminine side. The ups and downs of Erin's personal life parallel those of the Hinkley case, creating an even more enticing story line.Overall, Erin and the people of Hinkley's battle against the giant corporation PG&E, resembles the classic David and Goliath plot line. This real life story of one company's carelessness that lead to the suffering of an entire town, is one that will make you laugh, cry, and even get a little angry. Erin plays the hero that we all strive to be, and so much more. The great acting, character development, and riveting plot line followed by a great overall theme and message is why I chose to give the film a high rating. However, this isn't necessarily a movie I could watch over and over again, as it doesn't leave much speculation or mystery. Nonetheless, it is a great movie that is most definitely worth watching. 0.11108008658008658\n",

      "This is the type of movie that puts me off Steven Soderbergh. I started to find interest in the guy earlier this year when Side Effects surprised me but it's half-assed efforts like this that just make me feel like his hearts not in it. Which is a real travesty on my part because the guy does his cinematography and editing as well as directing. Erin Brockovich is a bland slow film. It works on a simple and boring juxtaposition of a sexy young Mom doing legal work she's not trained to do. It's satisfying as she's driven by a need for justice but it's not as interesting as it thinks it is. Roberts is okay, good for her but not awards worthy. It feels like Oscar bait really, hitting all the checklist, but in mild quantities. There's just not enough meat on this film. Soderbergh keeps giving a little and thinks its enough. Perhaps I should rewatch Traffic, I know that's a complex film.6/10 0.10535714285714287\n",
      "\"Erin Brockovich\", with Julia Roberts in the title role, is a not-too-serious and entertaining film based on a true story.

      "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I expected much from Erin Brockovich. It received Oscars, much praise, hype and story after story on the real life Erin Brockovich. And indeed, the story is a worthy one - single mother makes good and finds her true calling, helping out a whole town in the process! Occasionally, the film is heart-rending and often very funny. It's also nice that it doesn't go overboard on the schmaltz - being realistic about the problems Erin and George have in balancing out work and a personal relationship. However, everything just floats by all too nicely.. with no real struggle. The meeting with PG & E seems far too easy and the case is won without us even seeing the final hearing with the judge. It's all cut and dried with no real drama or suspense. We know that she's going to win before the story even ends.Great performances all round and still a very entertaining film but I don't think it deserved the OTT praise that it received. Part of me is left thinking that this won awards purely because it was socially conscious. Is that being too cynical?6/10 0.18575680272108844\n",
      "Erin Brokovich is all about two characters: the title character, played by Julia Roberts, and Ed Masry, played by Albert Finney. Brokovich is a bold and flashy woman; given all the buzz, everyone reading this has surely already heard about her wardrobe. Masry is a talented but world-weary lawyer in a small law firm.Roberts and Finney are both in fine form here, making the characters sympathetic and believable. The supporting cast is not as strong - none of the other characters in the film seem entirely filled-out - but that's a minor quibble.There is a bit of a tone of moral righteousness here. After all, it is the story of a nobody going up against Big Business, not to mention the obstacles facing a single mother in the working world. But it's not overdone, and the film succeeds in getting you to root for the underdog, an always popular pastime. 0.20457393483709274\n",

If you watch behind the scenes on the DVD, there is an interview with the real Erin Brockovich. In this interview you can really see that Julia has done a fabulous job portraying her, and although this movie is about a very serious law case, there is a touch of humor that makes the movie even more enjoyable. This movie may follow others that are great but it is so different in its own way. I don't know how to explain it so i will just call it the 'X-factor'.

I love Julia. Julia as Erin is absolutely awesome and extremely sexy. I'm arriving at the very cusp of realization that I love Julia more than any other woman, any other man, or any other person in the history of our time or anyone else's time. She looks nice. I appreciate this movie and the real Erin Brockovich so much. Julia's fun! I want to be with her way more than Aaron Eckhart's character. Older-aged Finney is the best and most memorable Finney. Julia's got a great smile man, or woman, with the most deeply beautiful bright brown eyes and fiery orange red hair and beautiful so big pink lips and a great body.

      "I'll admit, even I'm jealous of her. She's blunt, unapologetic, strong willed, independent, hardworking, and maybe a little hotheaded and manipulative. But still, this is one film all the hardcore feminists will want to see. The movie Erin Brockovich chronicles the life of, you've guessed it, Erin Brokovich, played by the amazing and talented Julia Roberts. This drama is based on the true story of Brokovich who, with no legal background of her own, helped win the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit.Erin Brockovich is a hardworking single mother of three young kids living in Southern California. In the opening scene, one sees Brokavich across from what appears to be a doctor. Brokavich explains she has kids and because of them she's learned a lot about medical procedures. Much to no one's surprise, she doesn't land the job. Immediately after she leaves the job interview she gets hit in her car at an intersection. Cue suspense. Well, this movie isn't a suspense film, but with an opening couple of scenes like these, one would hope for some plot twists. However, what really happens is that she ends up losing the personal injury lawsuit that resulted from the crash, which she claims wasn't her fault, and in thousands of dollars of debt, she is desperate for a job.Brockovich ultimately asks her gray-haired lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can offer her a job. He reluctantly gives her work as a file clerk in his office, despite her inappropriate cursing and outfits. During work one day Brockovich runs across some files for a case that was previously filed against the company Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). Brockovich, determined, starts investigating into the cases and visits people in Hinkley, California, to hear the first hand accounts of chrom 6 poisoning.She manipulatively persuades Masry to let her continue to do further research, but in doing so sacrifices spending time with her kids who end up being taken care of by her pseudo boyfriend and once unlucky neighbor George, (Aaron Eckhart). She discovers, however, that the PG&E Company has been purposely poisoning Hinkley's water supply, and covering up the fact that they were illegally doing so. This has what has been threatening the health of the entire community surrounding the plant where hexavalent chromium was found running off from the sites. For those of you people who don't know much about science (don't worry, I'm one of them) hexavalent chromium or (chrom 6) is very harmful to human and animal life. It causes chronic headaches, nosebleeds, bone deterioration, and cancers, all of which were reported by multiple residents of Hinkley. One scene that was heartbreaking was a slow zooming in of a girl around the age of 7 who appears to have cancer due to chrom 6 poisoning. Remembering that this story is based on true events, I can't help to think that this actually happened to someone, let alone a young child. It brought tears to my eyes.Do Brockovich and Masry end up winning the case? Well you'll have to watch all of the 131 minutes in order to find out. That's one downside to the movie- the length. Some scenes tend to draw out, but this movie is about a legal case, and those aren't really an edge-of-your-seat kind of thriller. However, the music complemented the pace of the movie and added suspension to some of the scenes. This movie is also rated R because of the foul language, so parents, don't let your kids watch this movie. But if you're a cool Mom, have your daughters watch this movie when they are teenagers and tell them that even they too can become something awesome like Brockovich. But don't teach them that using their cleavage, like she does in the movie, to persuade men is appropriate.Another reason this movie didn't get a full 10 stars is because there just wasn't enough romance. Maybe the writers (Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant) and the director (Steven Soderbergh) wanted to focus more on the full legal story than on Brockovich's romance with George. But as a sucker for good romance films, I wish there was more steamy scenes, if you know what I mean. The directors tried adding some more chemistry scenes between Brockovich and George but it still wasn't enough, at least for me. I wouldn't label this movie as a comedy either; the scenes are too intense to bring one even remotely close to a laugh. The movie in its entirety, however, was very well written and flowed nicely between scenes, adding to the fluidity of the film.Erin Brockovich herself makes an appearance in the movie as the waiter Julia in one of the first opening scenes. It is reported that the real Erin Brockovich sold the rights to her story to Universal Studios for a sum of $100,000. That's a lot of money, but given all that she sacrificed, she deserves it. Whether or not some of the details of her life, like the fact that she was Miss Wichita or actually used her cleavage to get what she wanted, is true or not, Julia Roberts does an outstanding job playing this role, which she even won an Oscar for.Ultimately, this is a film you'll want to see. If you like strong female roles, you'll love Erin Brockovich. Ed Masry says during a scene when Erin Brockovich is the last one at work along with himself, \"You're a girl. Why aren't you out to lunch with the other girls?\" She responds, \"I guess I'm not the right kind.\" This statement pretty much sums up the kind of person Miss Brockovich is, in real life and as portrayed by Julia Roberts. This movie will give you the confidence boost you might need, cause I know it did that for me. 0.18769841269841267\n",

      "Spoilers herein.After creating the truly exciting `Limey,' Soderbergh puts in some time to make some money.He panders, he sinks, he makes a movie that wins prizes and makes money. This film was created by Roberts because she found a character she can do. He dives into the world of bitches, smarmy personal injury and corporate lawyers, and irresponsible companies.What depresses me is not Roberts. We already know her limitations. We've heard this story many times; there's nothing new here. Roberts is no Russell Crowe; `Erin' is no `Insider.' (Why moviegoers celebrate this is truly depressing.)No, my problem is that Soderbergh is an artist -- the whole society loses when he works on tripe.

      "Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch. And I don't mean that literally. Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie. There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film. Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way. They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray! I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre. With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone. Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot. And she won't take none of your lip, neither. 0.06749368686868688\n",

      "These kinds of films are beginning to form a genre unto themselves. \"Marie,\" \"Silkwood,\" \"Afterburn,\" \"Guerin,\" \"Norma Rae\", and \"Brokovich.\" Elements, too, in other successful heart warmers like \"Mask\" and \"Class Action\".The basic idea is to pit a lower-class David against a multi billion-dollar Goliath and have the underdog win. (Maybe I should have included \"Rocky\" in that list.) Well, Erin Brokovich is the real thing, a trailer-park floozy with messy hair, a quick vulgar mouth, and boobs that look like two helium balloons about to pop up out of her push-up bra. No wonder her female coworkers hate her. Not just her looks though. She's a human dynamo at work. She collects something like 640 signed affidavits over a week and the stuffy partners at her law firm gawk and ask how she did it. \"I went out and distributed sexual favors,\" she says. \"Six hundred and forty BJs in five days. I'm tired.\" (The camera lingers on her triumphant expression so we can share her joy in humiliating her superiors.) It's very slickly done. Her life is filled with travails. I mean, out of work, three fatherless children, rear ended by some rich dope in a Mercedes. Fortunately there's a guy.Therein is an illustration of a slight problem. These folks look real enough on the surface but they're actually ringers. Erin, despite her cutting sarcasm, doesn't really speak much like a redneck and neither do the other people of her class. Nobody smokes. (Might drive away the intended audience.) The guy she falls in with is introduced as some kind of biker/doper wearing ragged jeans, a faded bandanna wrapped around his head, a beard, and a pony tale -- revving up his chopper after he moves in next door. But it's all a front. The bandanna is soon dropped and we get to know him for the quiet, quietly reassuring, supportive, child-loving Mensch that he truly is. When the trappings of bikerhood are gone -- and we never see the bike again -- he sits there in silence while Erin pours out her woes and, what with his neat beard, his reading glasses and his serenity and his slight, tolerant smile, he is more a Jewish psychotherapist than a biker.Of course he has to pack up and leave her at some point otherwise the movie would be absent one cliché. They're both sad about the split, and it doesn't last that long, but, as he explains it, he never sees her anymore because she's always working late. He does everything but say, \"You're already married -- to your job.\" There's never a moment's doubt about who is good and who is bad in a movie like this. Erin is authentic and good, like the earth before it was poisoned by PG&E. The fraudulent biker is also good. We know it right away, although she doesn't. Erin's boss, Finney, is good too, although a little gruff at times, kind of like Lou Grant. The victims of the lethal chromium isotope are all good too. None of them is in it for the money. The new partners that Finney acquires to help him cover his expenses are on the right side but they're pretentious. They dress in expensive tailored clothing and are aghast when Erin swears. The poor woman who represents the new partners looks as if she took baths in a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. There is no life either in her or on her. Her hair is pulled back severely, she wears a suit and tie, and her makeup gives her a cadaverous glow.It's not a thoughtful film by any measure, but it does get the job done. Goliath is vanquished by David and we applaud as the end credits roll. The performances are adequate -- no better than that, but no worse either. Sometimes the film borrows entire modules from other successful movies. The resentment of the antagonistic informant who answers the door when the investigator knocks. (\"Verdict,\" \"All the President's Men\".) The heroine caught up in the cause that threatens her love life. (\"Silkwood,\" \"Norma Rae.\") The script makes fun of a jealous fat woman.

      "\"Erin Brockovich\" will likely be remembered as director Steven Soderbergh's other film from the year 2000 (\"Traffic\") and of course for Julia Roberts' Oscar-winning performance. The film is not on par with \"Traffic\", but is still a great picture that may have been the second best film from the year. The titled character is an unconventional legal assistant whose greatest attributes are common sense and the ability to interact with anyone and everyone, no matter the situation. After mercifully receiving a job from small-time attorney Albert Finney (Oscar-nominated), Brockovich learns that the powerful Pacific Gas & Electric Company is dumping hexavalent chromium in an isolated area. This is causing many residents to become sick with strange types of cancers and other illnesses. What follows is one of the largest lawsuits in United States legal history. \"Erin Brockovich\" works because of dynamite performances by Roberts and Finney. This is easily the best work of Roberts' career and might be Finney's best performance as well. The screenplay is not as strong as it should be, but Soderbergh's direction more than makes up for the script. Overall an overwhelming success. 4.5 out of 5 stars. 0.3114718614718615\n",
      "This Movie is just simply OUTSTANDING, Why. Simpley because many claim that this movie is not a brilliant tag line nor interesting, thats because it's true life Drama and i think the contrast of this is very wise. Julia Roberts SKYROCKETS her performance and EMBRACES the attitude, force, power, cleavage and a kiss ass hard gal who cares about other people so much, she presents a SHINING WOMAN.Julia plays a broke, mother of three, jobless woman who changes her life in the most unlikely circumstances. It starts out as Erin Brockovich (Roberts), having a car accident and hires a lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), she loses the case, Brockovich turns up at his office and demands a job he has no choice but to hire her.She now is working for Masry and is pending against PG&E, a gas and electric corporation who is polluting a small town. These illnesses which are threatening this town are very serious they include, Breat cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma and nosebleeds and in some cases, even LIFE Threatening. She spends a lot of time reading and taking careful time going through this, Brockovich knows every illness and every clients number life illness and information, Erin does not mess around neither bides time she gets to the immediate point, says it out load, blunt, bold and clear, this is one reason why i love this movie so much it's so CLEVER.There are so many reasons why i love this movie, but the second reason is because any movie which has 'Thomas Newman' music performed in any movie is brilliant his music is so OBSCURE and DIFFERENT Thomas Newman has performed music for many other famous movie's which include 'Pay It Forward, The Green Mile and the modern master film 'American Beauty' with Kevin Spacey, his music was completely suitable for this work of art per say. Thomas's music is also and is most suited for Drama's because i think the contrast of the music is dramatic for dramatic movie's, maybe through Thomas's music it may make these films more outstanding think about it, all of these films are well known and they all have Thomas's music in them.When i first seen Erin Brockovich it starts out as, i was watching a documentary of Julia Roberts and it had shown clips of Erin Brockovich and it appealed to me my mum called me up and i said 'I think i will rent Erin Brockovich' and said to me 'I don't think it will be your scene' i rented it out anyway and i watched it and WOW! It was BRILLIANT i watched it over and over again every weekend i rented it out for about five weekends until i bought it and still today it is a favourite movie, and i still watch to this day. I watch Erin Brockovich in 2005, 5 years after it was made and i was surprised i hadn't seen it.I think if you want to consider watching this film, which i think you should read this and see what you think, but in my opinion you may or may not get hooked on it. You either LOVE IT OR HATE IT. Just rent it and see what you think, but i would give this movie a 10/10 rating a true life drama which is hard, touching and inspiring. 0.17338541666666663\n",
      "Okay, this film is Julia Roberts. There's no way of getting away from that. It might be a little different from her earlier films, and the role is perhaps a little more serious (a *lot* more serious than e.g. \"Pretty Woman\") than what she usually does, but it is still very much a Julia Roberts vehicle. She has got time to shine in this one. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing, because in this film it is not. Roberts is very charming and actually convincing as Erin Brockovich. The story lacks any depth, but it is still told in a satisfactory way by Steven Soderbergh. It's not his best film, but it's certainly very entertaining if about twenty minutes too long. I have to say, though, as much as I like Julia Roberts in this film, that Albert Finney was truly magnificent as her boss -- truly a great performance. (6/10) 0.23944444444444443\n",
      "Excellent job from Julia Roberts, with an incredible performance. Interesting plot that keeps your attention throughout, and is something you can definitely become invested in. 0.6\n",
      "Although filmed sixteen years ago, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was and is the modern day \"badass\" persona that every woman secretly has dwelling inside of her. No filter for her language or sense of professional style, Erin is headstrong, determined, self-motivated, and frankly could not care less about the opinions of others. Based on a true story, I would give the film 3.5 stars and describe it as a drama comedy. Set in Los Angles and Hickley, California, Erin serves as both an inspiration and real life story of the American dream, motivating the viewers that with passion and hard work, anything can be achieved. Erin's cry for financial desperation and her unique sense of humor is portrayed in the opening scene of the film where she is applying to a medical job that she clearly has no experience in, but this shows how much Erin is unafraid of rejection and humiliation. Erin's strong confidence stems from her ability to have raised three children without the support of a man, and it is her confidence that allows her to poke her nose where most people wouldn't dare to. Erin's life is shown as a plummeting spiral that one can do nothing but empathize with or simply laugh at- Erin has no income, three young children, no money in her bank account, a neck brace, and an attitude that has got her nothing but trouble. Simple activities like feeding her children or even just being in the house are over intensified because Erin is so dissatisfied with her life. Erin finally lands a job in Ed Masry's (Albert Finney) office, which is the first positive change in her soon to be completely different life. She seems out of place and disliked, but that doesn't stop her from earning her place of respect. Erin's relationship with Masry turns from disgust and hatred to a fulfilling, meaningful friendship while also being business partners.Erin's stance for her originality and blunt difference from the other personas in the movie is what makes her such a fascinating protagonist. Even when Masry asks her to rethink her wardrobe, Erin shoots back at him with \"maybe you should rethink your ties.\" A love interest occurs, like in all Hollywood dramas, but her boldness aids her in shooting down the bearded biker neighbor by the name of George (Aaron Eckhart) that would like to be more than just neighbors, even though love is the last thing on Erin's mind. Her bluntness is what makes her such an attention grabber and has people listen to what she has to say even though she has no formal professional schooling and acts far from how an employee would act in a law firm.Erin stumbles upon the records of Donna Jensen, who lives in Hinkley, and is perplexed as to why Donna's medical records are included in her real estate files. Finding this odd and unsettling, Erin takes this task into her own hands. Erin's personal search for Donna turns into something more than just completing her regular reception job, it becomes a passionate obsession that Erin is determined to get to the bottom of. Erin sets out to determine the significance and relevance of the medical records that were correlated with other real estate files. It's not obvious what exactly ignited the passion and concern in Erin to set out on her own to investigate these random real estate files, but this curiosity begins a long journey to attempt to provide justice to the residence of a small town in Hinkley, California. With the help of her wit and feminine beauty, Erin is able to dig through the water records of a notorious company by the name of PG & E, which may have something to do with the health of the residences surrounding the town of Hickley.As Erin's care for the families of Hickley grows deeper, her own personal life becomes more significant, fulfilling, and mature. Erin develops a deep and true care for the lives and well being of these people, no longer for a need of financial desperation, but for a need to do good unto others that have been unluckily touched by the illegal doings of big money companies. Erin gets to know the residences of Hickley on a far personal level and induces pathos in the audience. The film is not a full five star rating because although it's interesting it is just not a film that I would re-watch years from now or highly recommend to a friend. Although, it does accurately depict and raise awareness to the true events that happened in Hickley, there were many parts that caused me to be disengaged. Overall, the film is much more dramatic than the average documentary but allows the audience to be inspired by the determination of Erin Brockovich to do what's right while also improving her life. 0.1285232705714633\n",
      "Julia Roberts is not my favorite actress. She has hung on to a star that was sort of thrust on her from a movie that is not all that great, \"Pretty Woman.\" This, supposedly, established an edginess for her, though her character had literally no connection to a true prostitute. With all that said, I think she did fine in this film. I know that some have said that this has all been done before. So crusading for people victimized by humorless industrial entities has been done before. The strength, however, is in the specifics.

This is definetly a Hollywood picture and good causes are usually received well these days both by the public and the Oscars.  I recommend this as a good Hollywood movie, and Roberts does a good job with what she has but I've seen her better. She probably won the Oscar for her career, but oh well why not.

I have never seen a picture with such heart throughout the whole movie.

Erin Brockovich becomes the key figure in a landmark legal battle when she embraces the role of advocate on behalf of residents whose health has been compromised by the presence of toxins in their water supply.Finely measured acting from Roberts and Finney really make this film a satisfying experience; their interaction provides a pleasing focus to the otherwise predictable plot development.

I've met people that seem to think they can't amount to anything in life but after seeing this movie some have realized that they can do almost anything they can put their minds to!  The vocabulary she used may not have been appropriate but she certainly got her point across.  The movie also makes me wonder how many large corporations in the world are getting away with illegal dumping of toxic waste.  I thought it was an excellent movie.

Soderbergh always seems to bring the very best out of those he's working with.  Although I don't hear a lot about him, I think he is one of the most talented directors around today.

I have a friend who knows Erin Brockovich and Julia did not do her much justice and over played her character in some ways. She did  not do everything herself as the movie would have you believe.

Especially when the star of the film is...Julia Roberts??? Her grossly irritating performance was enough to roil even Ms. Brockovich herself, and I can see why. Yet plenty of cinemagoers appreciate that level of acting, and if you're among them, then this will certainly tickle your fancy. Keep in mind, however, that numerous independent reports have refuted Ms. Brockovich's claims of environmental toxicity as total bogus.

      "My favourite film about a corporate lawsuit is Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter', which features a shifty, self-hating lawyer and a tragedy where it's very unclear whether anyone is to blame, and even if they are, whether anything is to gain by holding them to account. Stephen Soderbergh's 'Erin Brockovich' is a rather different story, in which Erin (played by Julia Roberts) brings a multi-million dollar corporation to its knees through a simple combination of loving her kids, wearing short skirts, swearing a lot and above all else, by caring too much. The latter is really her trump card - whenever there's a dispute about any point in the case, the corporate lawyers are always wrong and Erin is right because she cares. The film is based on a true story, and maybe this is actually how it happened, but it certainly doesn't provide any moral ambiguity to interest the viewer.

      "\"Erin Brockovich\" tells a ripping tale.  Julia Roberts is appealing in the title roll and has never been more charming and charismatic.  Albert Finney as the lawyer for whom Roberts works is, as usual, masterful.  As recent press reports have revealed, however,  the interesting, exciting story the movie tells is only incidentally similar to the events it purportedly depicts.  But that's all right.  This is entertainment, not history.  As we all know, when we hear the term, \"Based on a true story!\"  we should be warned that the emphasis is on the word \"based\" and a whole lot of the truth is sacrificed to the needs of dramatic story-telling.  Oliver Stone has done this sort of thing a lot, most prominently in \"JFK\" and \"Nixon\":  good films that mix historical fact with outrageous fiction in the name of dramatic license.  8 out of 10. 0.21459750566893424\n",
      "There's no justice.  She's her usual kooky self, and Albert Finney acts her off the screen... I found the movie a little disappointing.  Granted, the director avoids the usual 'courtroom climax' but - perhaps because of this - the movie ends with a whimper rather than a bang.  Only 6/10, I'm afraid.... -0.3145833333333334\n",
      "Small town and Julia Roberts playing another likeable, all-American yokel - hmm, this seems like a familiar formula.  And of course this is going to wind up being a hokey, humdrum, merely average movie just like Runaway Bride, right?  Nope, not even close.  Actually, it's probably the best mainstream movie to come down the pipe this year.  In fact, it plays off of Julia Roberts' image as this particular type of character, as the movie is all about appearances and the fallacy of catering to those images.  Julia prances around in EXTREMELY tight-fitting clothing while shouting sporadic obscenities, but despite this characterization, she is a wonderful and caring human being that you have to root for deep within your soul, even if you haven't liked a single one of her other films and practically despised her previous acting attempts(like myself).  This is an apparently ordinary person acting in an extraordinary fashion, bettering the lives of hundreds of people without having the audience question her integrity - Roberts is completely believable and lovable.  If you have ever been presented with the complexities of modern life, or seen others experience it and marvel at how they do it, you will cheer for Erin Brockovich.  9/10 0.15943754313319533\n",

      "When I first heard about the movie \"Erin Brockovich,\" I was worried that it was going to be something straight from Lifetime.  I was expecting to see a sappy, cheesy, \"based on a true story\" movie about a single mother fighting the world one-on-one doing everything she can to feed her children.  Now that I've seen the movie, however, I know that I was wrong.  Julia Roberts portrays Erin excellently, and her performance makes this movie shine. Sure, it's not much more than a \"feel good\" movie, but hey...what's wrong with that?  It has a good plot, good characters, and an all-around good feeling to it.

      "Very entertaining movie, which held my attention throughout. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were just outstanding in the lead roles. Only criticisms are two: The \"R\" rating for language was much deserved. The movie could have been just as effective if the language was curbed. The firey personality of Erin could have been displayed just as well, and the movie could have been more available to younger audiences, which would be beneficial. It was disappointing to me to see someone of the stature and appeal of Julia Roberts using such crude language and probably 95% of the foul talk was in her script. The only other negative feature was the tiresome politically correct themes that seem to always appear in Hollywood productions, of the bad capitalist corporations, and the strong capable female and weak dependent males. PC was violated, however, with insults hurled at an overweight female character. With these exceptions, it was in the top category of movies I have seen. 0.02971014492753622\n",

      "Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID 0.19396613190730838\n",

      "Erin Brockovich is an average woman on her own with three little children. She has absolutely no education and starts working at an insurance company I believe it was. And then she comes to the stories of people who got sick after pollution in the air. She goes on an investigation, and after a lot of talking to her boss she convinces him to help her get these people money for the pain the company has cost them. The law firm which helps them is no good in Erin's eyes, and she continues talking to the people herself. In between she has to leave her kids in the hands of a tough biker who really loves them and she kind of falls in love with him too.

      "When I first heard that Steven Soderbergh (my new favorite director after \"Out of Sight\" and \"The Limey\") was directing a Julia Roberts movie, I was worried. Would this be a big sell-out Hollywood picture? I was worried for no reason. Soderbergh comes through once again, and in a very big way. Like he did for George Clooney in \"Out of Sight\", Soderbergh also does for Julia Roberts: making a famed actor step out of their famous persona and instead become a very detailed character. Julia Roberts pulls in a great performance in this movie, for any reason but the fact that you don't get a constant reminder that you are watching \"Julia Roberts\". Erin Brockovich comes alive in a startling way and makes a fine counterpoint to the typical Julia Roberts role: she is brashy, trashy, strong but still utterly likeable. While many of the stylistic editing techniques that Soderbergh has used (most eloquently in \"The Limey\")have been toned down for this crowd-pleasing picture, they are still there.

Plot perfunctory but fun, acting, especially Julia Roberts, a surprising joy. Main reason the film is a must, of course, is Steven Soderbergh, catching up on Tim Burton as America's greatest director, here enjoying flexing his considerable creative muscles in a populist woman's picture - his 'cubist' editing; his sense of the wide American outdoors and minutae of domestic life (in a hilariously Hollywood version of the working class); his sardonic visual jokery (those skyscraper shots); his continued interest in parents and children (see THE LIMEY, THE GREEN ROOM); his refusal to patronise his heroine. 0.27936507936507937\n",

Lets look at the inconsistencies 1) Is her character a smoker or not,(not that I am a fan of smoking in movies) she smokes once at the beginning of the movie then never again.(Why) 2) Also the Character claims the reason she wears sexy clothing is because she finds it most comfortable but when she gets home after work she changes into sweats.

      "WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADERIN BROCKOVICH is an overlong, routine star-turn for Julia Roberts. As Brockovich, Roberts shows the fashion sense of Cher, the vocabulary of Madonna (or Whoopi Goldberg), the sanctimony of Alan Alda, and the belligerence of Robert DeNiro (or Jack Klugman as QUINCY). A single mother with no education and trying to raise three children, Roberts/Brockovich struts around with a perpetual chip on her shoulder. To Roberts credit, she makes Brockovich understandable, though not overly likable (WAY too beligerant).  We also learn two heretofore undiscovered things about Roberts. She has a beauty mark (lovely spot, by the way), and she should NEVER again wear platform shoes.Brockovich intimidates herself into a job as a legal aide, and quickly uncovers a coverrup involving Pacific Gas & Electric, horribly polluted water, and people dieing of cancer; all the while, PG&E is consciously covering all this up.  During the course of her crusade, Brokovich succeeds in neglecting her children and driving away the only worthwhile man in her life. And what about the people made sick by PG&E.  They are portrayed and whiny and passive.  Hasn't anyone ever heard of a picket line?  NOTHING would get in and out of the gates of PG&E if it were MY family dying from their criminal activity.The movie reveals Brockovich received a $2,000,000 bonus for her work on this case.  Roberts received 20,000,000 to play her on screen.

She was not perfect and when the movie was over, she had still not sorted out all the facets of her life - something no-one else has ever done, so why should she?The secondary characters were well defined, being more than just cardboard cut-outs.  They had their own desires and dreams and we got to see just enough of them to care.Take the time to see this movie.  I am sure you will not be disappointed. 0.08831168831168831\n",

The story line seemed to start really early in the two hour movie and end very quickly.

      "I consider this film dreadful. I watched it just because of Steven Soderbergh, but he has betrayed his other funny films. If you like movies and you are more than fourteen, regardless  the `based on actual events', you will have the feeling of having watched this film two hundred times before, it is the same old story, absolutely predictable, a bad drag of `trial, lawsuit, lawyer, investigacion,",
      "', very very already seen and boring. Furtthermore the fact of choosing Julia Roberts for the role is a huge mistake, I don´t believe her at all and I hate the `science fiction' way she acts in a very `realistic?' movie.

      "Having read a number of reviews submitted by various users, i was a rather depressed by all the negativity expressed.  I think I'll balance things a little.  I found the film really moving, Albert Finneys performance was excellent, as was was Julia Roberts' and Eckhart's.  If people were dissapointed by the eventual predictability of Julia's character I hasten to point out that the whole point of the film, actually a true story, is that she is very much just a down to earth, normal, no frills, single mom. Except for the fact that she was Miss Wichita years back.  As such it is a really effective and moving story about the underdogs fight against corporate America, about normality, common sense and caring winning through. A lovely change from the regular fare of hyped up splashy movies. Definitely recommended for the family, and a must see for my Mum! 0.16029030910609857\n",

      "Whoa!! What can I say or more to the point what can't I say about this movie? Well first off, I would like to say that I like Julia Roberts as an actress but this is the first time that I didn't think of her as Julia Roberts. I just hope the fact this movie came out so early they don't forget it at the Oscars!! Second thing, was as I was watching the movie I could not believe that this was based on a true story, scary was not the word! Thirdly, I'm I the only person to see the real Erin Brockovich in the film as the waitress at the Diner?

      "Erin Brockovich is a strong and likable woman not because she is calm, polite or rich; it's due to the authenticity of her character that makes her so adorable. She feels like a REAL woman, who albeit having some bad qualities, never gives up on her desires. Julia Roberts does, in here, one of the best performances of her career, which is the main reason why this film works. The plot, on the other hand, is sometimes a little too long, which made me think there is no need for two hours of length. Also, I expected a little more intensity in the outcome, since I expected it to be the movie's climax. However, in fact, there is no climax at all. \"Erin Brockovich\" is a good storytelling and has a great acting, but never tries to provoke strong emotions, so don't expect it to be a tearjerker and you'll probably have a good time. 0.22101449275362323\n",
      "Erin Brockovich (2000): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger, Peter Coyote: Overrated pathetic showcase based on a true story of a single mother who has been through several jobs. Albert Finney plays her lawyer who loses an opening case regarding her car accident. One day she practically hires herself on a case regarding a firm's lack of warning regarding toxic water. The firm is trying to force people out of their homes with little money to cover expenses. Her relationship with her biker neighbour is an unnecessary romantic subplot. Director Steven Soderbergh doesn't include a single interesting shot unlike his much more interesting Out of Sight. It is as if he just sat the camera down and let it run. There is too much showcasing of Julia Roberts in whorish clothes, and her verbal bouts are done more for show than character. Albert Finney as her lawyer is a prop. Aaron Eckhart as her neighbour is unnecessary. Marg Helgenberger is featured as one of the interviewees. Peter Coyote is also featured to remind us that once upon a time he was in a great film called E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. The role is fairly standard where she tells us what we already know and awaits Roberts to make everything better. Message is thwarted thanks to focus on skimpy clothing, hokey dialogue and romantic drivel. Score: 1 / 10 0.046264665286404424\n",

      "Even with such high ratings, I was skeptical to spend a Saturday evening with this film. I don't regret it one bit.Julia Roberts is at her best, with a dramatic story with slight comedic interludes. The story, regardless of its content, is as true to life as they come. And Julia, as Erin, represents a trait every woman wishes she could have - the gall to stand up for what she believes, the compromise between love and goals, and the strength to carry herself through anything.Two very promising thumbs up to the story, the actors and the director. 0.13\n",
      "This was one of the most entertaining and most inspiring movies I've seen in a long long time.  Erin (Roberts) is totally believable as the single mother of three who is struggling to provide.  Just doing her job she discovers information about a big water and electric company that is causing deaths. And, because of her courage and determination - the kind that most mothers and most women have (at least the ones I know)- she is able to expose the truth and win.  Go see it and forget about the language & the clothes - she's like Kitty in Gunsmoke -- she may be tough but this lady has a kind of class that goes beyond language and clothes, she cares and is willing to go all out to save an entire town of people.

I wonder what the PG&E people thought when they watched this, I'm sure some have.This is one movie you don't want to screw up with casting, because it portrayed people who were suffering things one could only imagine.

      "True biographical story told in a simple David v Goliath fashion really is Julia Roberts tour de force. Ten years after her breakout Hollywood appearance in Pretty Woman (1990) she is now at the top of her game in this film. Earning her then highest paid actress in Hollywood accolade and the Best Actress Academy Award that went with it.Roberts plays said Erin Brokovich, a down on her luck, broke, mother of three, divorced twice and involved in a road traffic accident not of her fault. Her lawyer is Edward Masry (played by a delightful supporting role by Albert Finney).Blagging her way into employment at the legal office of Masry Roberts becomes an unofficial legal assistant, underqualified perhaps but caring and determined yes. Some of her quotes in this film are a delight to watch and I can link it to a decade later insight into her character from Pretty Woman (1990) that I keep harking back to.Directer Steven Soderburgh brings the story across in a formulaic but enjoyable way. It is a path that has been trod so many times in the movies but is still highly watchable none the less! 0.2188624338624339\n",
      "If you were to believe the critics that raved about this movie, you'd think it's a masterpiece.  When in fact, only about the first half hour of it is worth seeing.  Julia Roberts delivers a fine performance at the beginning and then proceeds to become more insufferable and self-righteous as the movie progresses. How many times can the camera cut to a close up of her listening raptly and reacting almost tearfully every time someone else shows up with cancer? It's repetitive, boring and needless and it makes you hate her guts instead of liking her. Aaron Eckhart, the darling, is stuck once more in a thankless role but we should be grateful to Mr. Soderbergh for casting him. A good actor and adorable to the bone.  Everything else is totally fake in this film.  And the critics who must be tired of seeing so much s**t, think this is better than average Hollywood crap. It isn't.  The Limey was much better than average Hollywood crap.  Erin Brockovich is Hollywood dreck. -0.028260869565217398\n",

Delightful movie, with hysterical, sleazy clothes that \"fit\" her perfectly. The language kind of surprised me, but it was definitely in keeping with her character. Some parts were so funny and the audience laughed so hard that you couldn't hear the next lines; worth a second viewing to get those lines. Kept my interest throughout. Not as predictable as I thought it would be. Albert Finney was excellent in his role too, and the guy who played George should be getting more parts very soon :-).

In my view, it's a good story about one girl who manages to do whatever she feels like it.  I rank it a 7 out of 10.  Not really interesting plot but it's ok... 0.12812500000000002\n",

      "Erin Brockovich essentially combines two movies. The first being about a single mother of three struggling to support her kids in a materialistic country.  The second being about said single mother transcending stereotypes by discovering and investigating a cover up by a large utility about the damage that their plant has caused local residents. The great achievement that director Steven Soderbergh makes is to combine these two elements seemlessly. Julia Roberts is in superb form in the titular role and her co-star, veteran Albert Finney, turns in an excellent performance. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's main squeeze, George and Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, the woman whose Real Estate claim starts the whole thing off. The screenplay by Susannah Grant provides Roberts with lots of snappy one-liners, which I'm not quite sure the real Erin Brockovich said. But hey! It makes for more fun in the movie.

      "The time has come for Steven Soderbergh to sell out. I'll always think of The Limey as his last film before selling his soul to Hollywood. It's hard to believe that the director of sex, lies, and videotape made this. Soderbergh used to be one of the godfathers of independent filmmaking (before there was Tarantino, there was Soderbergh). The name Soderbergh meant quality cinema. I thought Out Of Sight was a little too mainstream, but I saw what he was doing: trying to take an action film, and give it the kind of gritty feel that The French Connection or Serpico used to have. Most directors don't make them like that anymore (pardon the cliche). Following that, he perfected the gritty action drama with The Limey. These movies prove that he is above directing a knockoff of A Civil Action built around Julia Roberts. What's next? Jim Jarmusch directing the third Mission: Impossible? (If you're reading this Mr. Jarmusch, I know you wouldn't do that really. I'm just illustrating how ridiculous this seems to me. I think you're a brilliant artist.) 0.05104166666666667\n",

      "This movie was highly predictable at best. I've seen The Insider, A Civil Action, Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal, Silkwood, and after that, you know what to expect from this movie.Basically Julia Roberts does a very convincing and talented performance as a harried mother of three, looking for work to support her family, and is unable to find any (she often has outbursts of swearing and such) until she meets a crabby lawyer and he reluctantly hires her. Soon she finds herself in the middle of a dangerous and disturbing case involving a gas company ditching chromium into the water supply of a neighborhood where the residents are suffering from cancer, chronic nosebleeds, all that toxic waste stuff. She also meets George, a biker who at first seems sleazy but turns out to be a nice guy.Despite amazing acting jobs and good soundtrack, this is a tiring plot done time and time again, environmental paranoia as usual. Although it's based on true events it it highly dramatized and there are various dragged out parts of the movie that could do with some editing. It also really puts corporations in a bad light; how quickly people forget that if they want products and fuel, industry has to come before the planet sometimes, whether they like it or not.Erin Brockovich isn't bad, but it could do with some rethinking. 0.1112820512820513\n",

But, it's not all wrong with this picture. At the end it gave me a good feeling, but it still looked a lot like A Civil Action. Albert Finney plays his best role so far (while he never does anything bad). A simple twist of his mouth and the whole cinema start laughing, with Julia, that never happens. Now who is the best actor of them two?Besides Julia the movie has a lot to make it worth watching. It has drama, comedy, thriller, enough to make everybody pleased.

With less than desired education and a lack of social graces; a brash, crude, obnoxious, but savvy young woman takes on a large utility company. Citizens of the small town of Hinkley are struggling with various maladies including cancer. The cause seems to be large amounts of chromium. Ms. Brockovich(Roberts) working as an assistant to a reluctant attorney(Albert Finney), not only becomes savior of the community, but martyr as well.I found myself bored with this over hyped film. Roberts was nice to watch, but a score of other actresses could have played the part. Conchata Ferrell and David Brisbin also appear.

Where this story differs though is simply in the performances and how real it makes the characters seem. You absolutely feel for these people not only because we know it actually happened but also because they make you feel like it's really happening to them. Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date by playing this woman honestly. I'm so glad they didn't try to gloss Erin up by making her seem to good to be true.

Though the movie at times seems a little too melodramatic, Roberts performance in the title role wins you over.  It is by far her best work as an actress, mixing a trucker's mouth, \"pushed-up\" sex appeal, and that winning smile.  It is definitely Oscar worthy, as is the supporting role of Albert Finney as Brockovich's boss.

Every motion is lead by another predictable action. Like when she met the biker. We know what is coming after wards. So the producers probably wanted to make it different from others. They dressed the heroine like a hooker with a foul mouth. We see a lot of Julia Robert's skin throughout the picture. And that's were the film diverts. It's hard to forget that we're seeing Julia Roberts instead the real Erin Brockovich. Even her children are not likable characters. She outshines them all. There's also a lack of suspense. Except for one incident, her life of safety is never threatened. Kind of odd if you're going against such a huge corporation.If the movie's purpose is to entertain, it succeeds.

Sit back and enjoy true to life dialog and a great true story. Albert Finney is top notch in his supporting role as well. He fit the role perfectly and his facial expressions make the whole story work.  It is isn't often that the kids are realistic, and these kids must have moved in with Julia for a while because they were so cozy together.  It didn't seem awkward like, for example, Jake Lloyd is Star Wars.  Great JOB by all! 0.33846666666666664\n",

The fact that someone without a degree or higher education can pull off a stunt like this, only looks a little incredible, but aren't many films like that?Steven Soderbergh (King of the Hill,Traffic) did a fine job, Albert Finney (Miller's Crossing,Traffic) was excellent, and so was Julia Roberts.

I have to go back and look at his name and then look for him in other movies because that man knows how to act. I definitely recommend the movie to almost anyone (except children). What she does is important and she does it in a very gutsy way. Enjoy! 0.3511111111111111\n",
      "I have an inclination to despise Roberts, and it has served me well in life. Despite Soderbergh being one of my favourite directors and some positive reviews, I missed the cinematic release because of Roberts. I eventually caught it on television recently, and I have to say it wasn't bad. Roberts was obviously annoying, but it does entertain for it's 2 hours. You cannot escape that Soderbergh probably did this to finance \"Traffic\", but it's an above-average multiplex effort. -0.2545454545454545\n",

      "It took the talent of Steven Soderbergh to pull off a successful legal drama in Hollywood.  Coppola failed with The Rainmaker and Steven Zaillian failed miserably with A Civil Action.  Erin Brockovich takes a similar plot outline and wins because it doesn't bore the audience with anti-climatic court room scenes.  Erin Brockovich pulls on all the right strings, manipulating the audience at will.  The audience is more than willing to go along for the ride as the cliches are hidden under great direction and inspired acting and the somewhat made for TV plot is given expert treatment from Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich will give Soderbergh the box office respect he deserved from Out of Sight and may land Julia her second Oscar nod. 0.06793650793650793\n",
      "Julia Roberts's best film to date also features her finest performance, as well as great supporting work by Albert Finney, Marg Helgenberger, and Aaron Eckhardt, and a stalwart cast from top to bottom.  Steven Soderbergh does a fantastic job of providing an audience-delighting comedy-drama that makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you whoop and holler. It's closer in spirit to \"All the President's Men\" than to the movie it's bound to be compared with, \"Silkwood.\"  This one isn't in \"President\"'s rarefied league, but it puts \"Silkwood\" in the shade, and Julia trumps Meryl handily by being not only fully up to the emotional demands of the part, but by being hilariously funny as well--and physically a dream.  Finney hasn't been this good in years, and Eckhardt displays the kind of charismatic charm one couldn't have guessed he had from \"In the Company of Men.\"  This is a genuine winner and an instant super-classic! 0.39375\n",

It may be too early to predict but she may get an Oscar nomination at next year's Oscar ceremonies. Playing the part of Erin Brockovich upstages \"Pretty Woman\"'s Vivian and \"Steel Magnolias\"'s Shelby to the third degree. The story never faltered for a moment and the supporting players seemed to know how to project their characters to keep it from looking like Julia was the only one on the set who knew how to play a part.

Well, after more than two hours of nothing (except Julia's petty clothes !!), I wonder if just because this movie deals with noble things: cancer, children, the victory of the small against the big, etc, a score of nearly 8 is justified ? More than one time I was to abandon the cinema, but I resisted till the end hoping for something to happen. No way !! Sometimes the job of a movie maker is to transpose a real fact into a movie without adding anything. But if the reality is such a boring list of events .. think for a moment to the people that spends two hours of their time on a cinema chair. They aren't in the story, though a very noble one that touches everyone heart !! The  only \"live\" moments are the ... naked part of Julia's body!! and some nice sentences that waked up the audience and got some laughs. In conclusion, a boring two hours of a wonderful woman (that, by the way, meets a nice and handsome man) who does such a great and noble action so that you cannot say: what a bad movie !! 0.20870265151515147\n",

      "The movie starts with a man's words on a black screen, the next frame shifts and focuses on Julia Roberts beautiful face heavy with baby blue eye shadow and big voluminous hair. You almost believe you're watching Pretty Woman, but you'd be mistaken! Julia Roberts is Erin Brockovich in the biographical movie directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by Susannah Grant. This movie tells the story of the people from Hinkley, California in the San Bernardino County and how Erin Brockovich unlocked the secret to Hinkley's many unfortunate health issues. The story of Erin Brockovich is by far an interesting one. It is a story about a strong, motivated, and driven woman who never took no for an answer. Erin Brockovich is a single mother of three who has been kicked down and hit with misfortune after misfortune. After leaving a disappointing and discouraging job interview, Erin gets hit by a rich asshole zooming through a red light. Seeking compensation from the reckless driver, she ends up in Ed Masry's office in search of lawyer.My 8/10 rating stems from the great performances done by the actors, the amazing wardrobe and costume department, and the great directing. It is no secret that a good movie and a good director go hand in hand. Director Steven Soderbergh did a fantastic job at creating a film that depicted Erin Brockovichs' life and the Hinkley Water Crisis on screen in an easy going and realistic manner. The characters were likable unlike other \"underdogs\" that annoy the audience because we just know things would work out for them eventually.

      "I saw ERIN BROCKOVICH mere days before I saw Erin Brockovich and, while definitely worthwhile, the movie often focuses too much on the woman behind the case and not quite enough on the particulars of the case itself... much like what happened when she arrived here in wilmington, north carolina, to address 300 concerned citizens regarding Dupont's dumping of carcinogenic chemicals into the Cape Fear River (the source of drinking water for 250,000 north carolinians). Alongside a \"water expert\" who spouted indecipherable gobbledygook for the better part of an hour and a half, Brockovich said, in essence, that it's all up to US to get things Right (the Mayor of wilmington, who owns a construction company, didn't bother to show up at this Public Meeting- perhaps because he'd gotten wind of something that Brockovich revealed to us that night: that there's a pipeline like the infamous North Dakota Access Pipeline about to begin construction HERE, before long). Like we ain't got enough problems, already... Crack Town- wilmington- has been referred to as \"Ground Zero\" for the opioid epidemic in this company (the so-called \"united\" $tate$ of ameriKa), with a reported 13% of wilmingtonians hooked on opioids (my guesstimate is much higher- 40-50%-, based on personal interactions I've had with many of the locals over the past two decades). When I arrived here, the then-governor was in the process of accepting a bribe of half a million dollars from the local Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow them to dump Nuclear Waste into the Cape Fear River. (There was no follow-up investigation, as far as I know.) I've personally seen men openly armed with handguns in grocery stores, gyms, pawn shops and shopping mall parking lots hereabouts and the sight never fails to give me pause. The \"housing\" DE-Construction going on to accommodate the projected 65,000 newcomers to Crack Town over the next 10-15 years is causing even worse flooding than ever (my own used bookstore was flooded nearly 20 years ago). The bottom line: the denizens of Crack Town are up S--t Creek, without a paddle... News of some small comfort: Brockovich also told us that all of the water fountains in Washington have DON'T DRINK THE WATER! THE WATER IS POISON! signs on them.

      "\"Erin Brockovich\" is truly the film that truly made Julia roberts a star being that she transitioned herself from a star in romantic comedies, here she makes the move to starring in a movie that won her over with the fans and with the Academy Awards in 2001.Starring in titular biopic of a paralegal confronting corrupt businesses and exposing their fraudulent ways without a care for her reputation in the process. The sides of Brockovich are handled in three integral parts. Her crass ways are never vulgar, just high-spirited. She may dress with questionable taste, but she has a heart of gold. If she berates and verbally mocks other people it's not that she's inconsiderate or mean, but because a lot of the corporations she's taking on hire some of the most underhanded and corrupt people on this planet. And for a bonus, she may act like she's naive, but we realize that she even hoodwinks the viewers revealing she's anything but.\"Erin Brockovich\" epitomizes every character that Roberts has starred in since she made her debut in the mid 1980's. The character of Brockovich herself is the atypical figure that the film industry idolizes. Roberts was rightfully cast as she can talk tough and smart and still be attractive at the same time.The movie centres around this young paralegal who is a divorced, single mother of three children who's journey itself deserves to be written on paper. Though her job is not all that exciting or heavily paid, but was stunned when she found out that a major corporation like Pacific Gas and Electric were offering to underhandedly pay medical bills in the California town where their offices run. She goes undercover to further investigate with all the essential documents needed for a class action lawsuit and exploiting this corporation that are responsible for contaminating the water which has contributed to many civilians who have contacted several health problems.In her grinding research, she has met a hairless little girl who had to have chemotherapy, a lady battling breast cancer and her husband who's dying of lymphoma. In one of the more pivotal cases she tells a woman named Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) that what's ailing her is not from bad luck, but bad water which led to her getting her kids out of the water.Under the direction of Steven Soderbergh and based on actual events, this movie stands out as a true underdog story of how a small time paralegal goes through great lengths to take down a big corporation that has investments raging in $28 billion. Albert Finney plays lawyer Ed Masry who will have to go though great lengths to exploit this company for who they really are. Nobody ever said this case was going to be easy. Granted that Roberts usually handles performances on her own merits, but here it's Soderbergh that calls the shots plus he has to in order for this film to work and being this is not a fictionalized character she's portraying.If Roberts took control of the character, this movie would end up falling victim to satire. Though she carries the heavy cargo throughout the movie, her emotions have to be spot-on and the camera's attention is based off of her. The other cast members have to remain frozen until Roberts has the final camera-shot of her. Whether she's happy, angry or in crocodile tears, we the audience are cued how to react. Roberts has a reputation of being quite self-indulgent and though Soderbergh gives her that freedom to some extent, to the point where it really becomes Julia's world and everyone else is just secondary.Soderbergh does assure that the supporting characters are not underused here. Finney's character Masry is strong here though his reactions are mostly to stay disgruntled by his head-strong clerk, but underneath that hidden exterior is a man with a heart of gold who's contemplating retirement, but her presence does give him some strength. Veanne Cox is outstanding in some low-key comic relief as an uppity lawyer who's big fault was to usurp the determined Brockovich.The only weak scenes is when Erin's personal life is added to the story. And though Aaron Eckhart was very good as the George, the kindly biker who looks after Erin's kids all day. Sure it adds character development to some extent, but other times it can be a bit of overkill. The personal scenes were at the most quite mundane. Fortunately the lawsuit is still the primary focus and this is what people came in to see even going far as to say they would rather watch the lawsuit scenes than Roberts gracing us with her emotions. 0.09689078917952157\n",
      "Steven Soderbergh, after over a decade of experimenting in various forms of independent film (sex, lies and videotape; The Underneath; Schizopolis; The Limey), has begun to dabble in the mainstream; his current marriage, to a major studio film with an A-list star, could have been enough to send him scurrying back to the art house.The result here is not stillborn but a frisky, friendly child full of surprises. Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh's comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts, is in outline a lot like several other films, particularly A Civil Action, as well as the sort of true-life empowerment story you see on Lifetime every six months or so. But this film moves with a light step, and it takes time not just to establish characters but to appreciate them. You're in the hands of a director who genuinely likes people. In tone, the movie is actually closer to gentle mid-period Jonathan Demme films (like Melvin and Howard or Citizens Band) than to a routine legal drama.If Erin Brockovich didn't actually exist (she does, and has a cameo in the movie as a waitress named Julia), some screenwriter would've had to invent her for Julia Roberts. As written by Susannah Grant (Ever After and 28 Days), Erin is brassy, determined, full of love for her three kids and wary of everyone else; the character is perfectly suited to Roberts' strengths, and she plays Erin as a frazzled, ordinary woman with a knack for cutting to the point. No cutie-pie, Erin is a sharp, angular person -- an irresistible force that doesn't believe in immovable objects.After managing to find work at a California law firm, Erin starts to discover odd things in routine real-estate files: medical records that don't seem to belong there. She soon learns that a local plant, Pacific Gas & Electric, has been contaminating the water with chromium and has been trying to buy off the locals. With the initially grudging help of her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), Erin digs deeper and tries to rally the townspeople in a lawsuit against the corporation.In a way, Erin Brockovich is the distaff companion to Wonder Boys -- a disorganized wreck finds meaning in an endeavor larger than him/herself. The filmmakers here, as in Wonder Boys, pay more attention to subtleties of character than to plot mechanics. The actors are given space to bloom. Aaron Eckhart, so reptilian in his other roles (In the Company of Men, etc.), turns in a relaxed, friendly performance as George, the scruffy biker who gets involved with Erin and looks after her kids because he genuinely likes them. Albert Finney, too, seems energized in his many scenes with Roberts. They make a great team, providing two laughs for the price of one: Erin says something outlandish, and then Ed stands there silently, unsure whether to scream or laugh, or both. Watching Albert Finney struggling to keep his composure is one of the quieter pleasures of the movie season.Don't mistake Erin Brockovich for a classic or a masterpiece. Like Soderbergh's previous mainstream film Out of Sight, it's simply an example of Hollywood entertainment done with finesse and compassion, the way it always should be but so often isn't. Perhaps such a movie triumphs more because of what it doesn't do than because of what it does (Erin Brockovich, for instance, contains not a single tedious courtroom scene).The movie isn't really even about the lawsuit or about going after a corporation. It's about a woman finding out what she was meant to do, and finding the community that needs her. 0.0921502976190476\n",

Regrettably money will never be a true payment for justice, but the people at least were able to move.  I wonder how many of these man made disasters happen?  In Canada, we seem too have cover ups where I read the paper, and nothing ever get resolved with many issues.  I wonder if they get settled out of court.

Of-course the fact that she is not a perfect career woman, in terms of professional attitude and wardrobe style etc...  adds another element of reality as she is not THE perfect woman - yet she succeeds in a lovely way and with such support from us: people watching the movie! This movie, in addition to the very good performance of the cast and the main idea of the plot, also points out a very interesting point: a woman with a great setback of lack of a qualified expressing C.V. can make some significant changes given her innate sympathy, compassion and emotional intelligence.

      "Erin Brockovich is a movie based on real life affair that takes time in the 90' s, but the occurrence of the movie can still happen today.. After watching first few minutes of the movie, you don't really know how can this character, Erin, be one of the biggest icons in civil rights. Erin is a struggling single mother of three little kids, one of them is only a few months old. She tries to get a job, but she's declined after the doctor who needs an assistant finds out about. her background. On the way back home from the interview, she is involved in a car accident where she gets hurt and both her and the other car are seriously damaged. She tries to sue the other person involved, because they made the mistake, but she loses the case. She starts working for a lawyer who lost the case and this job is what changes her life forever. She's not a lawyer, she doesn't have a college degree, but she's naturally intelligent which makes her very popular with the clients.. While cleaning the storage room in the office, Erin finds an odd combination of documents and that's where the whole main part of the movie starts. She discovers that a huge American company is selling people dangerous water that seriously affects health and can lead to deadly illnesses. By physical contact, honesty, and forwardness, Erin gets the whole neighborhood to fight against the company. Her boss, an old average lawyer is doing the case with her, because Erin isn't real lawyer, she doesn't know the whole trial process and all the legal necessities. Later on, when the issue gets bigger and the amount of money they could get gets significantly higher, he gives the case to a much more skilled lawyer, who has more finances and is from bigger company. The new lawyer and his partner don't really give the people in the damaged neighborhood much chance and they don't have as much commitment as Erin, who's deeply hurt by losing the case to the better lawyer. The whole case almost falls apart, the affected people don't like the treatment they are getting from the new lawyers nor from the water company that's trying to get them quiet by buying their properties. At the last minute, Erin and her boss are able to get the people back on their side by being honest and fair to them and in the end, they make the impossible possible and win. The case was settled for US$333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. The main reason why Erin and all the neighbors won was because the water company couldn't refute the evidence of knowing about the issue. The company knew for years and made their old employees burn and hide all the incriminating documents. Erin got her hands on them because of a retired employee, whose brother died of cancer after living in the contaminated neighborhood for several years. The water company went bankrupt shortly after their lost because more issues from different areas came to the surface. The company's violation against civil right was so severe that there wasn't any way out for them. Personally, I think that this movie amazingly shows how normal Erin is. Erin's nobody special, low class single mother and twice divorced. The movie is really great at combining her personal life, work and showing her character. One thing that I liked the most is that she did not change. She never liked lawyers before she worked in a law firm, she didn't like them when she was working there as a normal secretary and she still did not like them after winning the case and being a partner. She stays herself even after winning a huge civil rights case. The neighborhood that had dangerous water was not informed about the chromium in it because the water company was manipulating them. They wanted to buy their houses, but for very low price, and their lectures on chromium were a huge propaganda. If anybody in the area got an analysis of the water and found chromium, they would think it's the good kind they were told about, not the extremely dangerous one and wouldn't try to get more into the topic. The doctors the company provided were bribed to say that the chromium does not have an affect on the illnesses the neighbors kept getting. They knew how dangerous this type of chromium was and they kept it a secret, violating a civil right of public awareness and basically a censorship. This movie definitely proves its point and they did a great job at remaking a real story about legal issue, while still being funny and very interesting. What started as every other romantic comedy changed into a movie where you have to think so you don't get lost in the information. It also touches several civil rights topics, from public information to gender equality. The second one is mainly presented by Erin and her personal life, in which she has to go through many struggles to prove that she matters and has a voice. 0.13420699583435436\n",

A very surfacey look at the story of the woman in the movie's title. To separate his work from appearing like that of, say, Penny Marshall, Soderbergh seems to insert long, boring parts into his movie so that people will see him as an auteur. \"Ain't he deep?!\" You can load a movie up with all the film school smoke you want, but I've watched enough Nick at Nite to spot bad '70's TV when I see it and let me tell you, kiddies, in Erin Brockovich I see it! Also, a very lousy job of balancing the love part of the story with the big bad corporate part.

Julia Roberts is as sexy as ever with this role now the real Erin Brockovich is missing something any guess? Try Julia Roberts with the bust.

      "Julia Roberts lights up the screen in this basically serious drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. Roberts is a single mother,\"Erin Brockovich\", struggling to raise three children of two failed marriages. She finally gets a job working for attorney Ed Masry, winningly portrayed by Albert Finney, and gets involved in a case involving a Love Canal-type suit with many plaintiffs and a Goliath-like defendant (Pacific Gas & Electric). The utility company is allegedly guilty of polluting the water in the plaintiffs' town causing a variety of diseases and tragedy and, of course, trying to cover it up.Soderbergh has directed this piece with a fine combination of humor, romance and poignancy. The film is peppered with salty dialogue, an able supporting cast (Aaron Eckhart, Conchita Farrell, & Marge Helgenberger) and a satisfying ending. The filmmakers have succeeded in creating a movie that is both entertaining, enlightening and even has a social message. 0.17301587301587298\n",

The first time I saw Julia Roberts was Flatliners, then I saw her in Hook and I finally saw her in Pretty Woman. Her first film she did was Mystic Pizza. I have never seen it. I think Albert Finney did a good job. I like the cinematography. This is one of Steven Soderberge's best films. I hope Julia Roberts keeps getting better roles. She is one of the best actresses.

She achieved so much during this time when she was dealing with this situation. There was only one thing that I didn't like about this movie and that was there was so much swearing in it.

      "The minute Julia stepped out disappointed from her first jobinterview I knew she was going to be sublime. I should have known. Soderbergh is an complete director not only involved with the technical details of filming, the best shots etc... but he gets the best out of his actors. There's no doubt about Julia Roberts her talent, she has grown so much but with big stars I think it is important to get a performance that makes you sometimes forget that your looking at a star. Personally I believe in underacting. Soderbergh does the same for Michael Douglas in Traffic I think. This could have been a very mediocre film, the subject alone screams movie of the week but it isn't. Soderbergh combines the best Hollywood techniques with  his own vision and insight and incredible talent. He knows what he's doing. Normally after making a critically acclaimed movie, young directors fall for Big Hollywoodprojects and find they can't handle it, probably the pressure of studio's , producers (hey I read Premiere), but Soderbergh stayed underground letting his talent grow while making films like 'kafka' and the sublime 'King of the hill', only recently he emerged into the spotlight with Out of Sight, a film as smoothly filmed as Jennifer Lopez's skin. His talent and films is why I go the movies. 0.1888888888888889\n",
      "Julia Roberts is the star in this based-on-a-true story film, \"Erin Brockovich\". It's a classic \"David and Goliath\" tale, that pits one woman against a huge corporation. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three, with little money and plenty of attitude. As she takes a job as a secretary in a law firm, headed by former lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she discovers the horrors taking place in the small town of Hinkley. The water has been contaminated, and has altered the lives of these working class people. Brockovich makes it her mission to take down PG&E (the corporation responsible for the contamination) and she and Masry, with the 637 Hinkley residents, go toe to toe with the corporate giant in court.Clearly, this is a vehicle for Julia Roberts, first and foremost. The character of Brockovich, the journey she goes on and the growth she experiences from helping people and making a difference is the main focus of the film. However, Roberts truly proves her acting skills and that she's more than a box office draw and a megawatt smile. Julia is known for taking on the \"girl next door\"-esquire roles. Even her breakthrough role as a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman\" was written as the nicest prostitute you'll ever meet. But, Erin Brockovich is a grittier character. She swears and struts her way through the scenery, chewing out those who challenge her and shocking more conservative types with her revealing wardrobe. Although she often comes off tough and provocative, it is also made clear that Erin has a warm heart. Her determination and defiance comes from an honest desire to help make her life and her kids' lives better. She also makes an emotional connection with the plaintiffs, seeing them less as clients and more as an extended family. The way Julia creates a nice balance between Erin's strong and soft side and makes her a complex character truly proves her talent. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved, in my opinion.Of course, there are other well played characters in this film as well. Albert Finney makes the contrast between his Ed Masry character and Erin Brockovich clear. He's conservative, she's over the top. He plays it safe, she makes her own rules. He thinks in a more business-like lawyer fashion, while she distrusts lawyers and tends to think with her heart (which helps her relate to the plaintiffs). As Erin's foil, it is clear that these two can learn from each other and as the film progresses they do. Aaron Eckhart is Erin's boyfriend George, who begins to feel inadequate when constantly playing Mr. Mom to Erin's kids, and Marg Helgenberger as one of the standout Hinkley plaintiffs. It is Erin's show, but the supporting characters help her to figure out more about herself and the world around her.All in all, the film is a pretty standard genre. Even the director, Steven Soderbergh, shoots in a straightforward (but visually rich) fashion. Nothing too suspenseful, as we all know what's going to happen in the end (or else the movie wouldn't be made). But, the story is entertaining and the acting is excellent.

At first no one takes her seriously because of her demeanor and clothes. Soon she looks into a case with the local power company. She discoverers that the power company had been dumping hexavalent chromium into the water supply and works hard until she sees justice. Many people were getting sick and she took the initiative to help the people in the only way she knew how to. She showed that not all lawyers care about the money.

It was a superior strong woman role and she was a real pleasure to watch, as she always is.Traffic and Sex, Lies and Videope director Steven Soderbergh put together another beauty of a show for our enjoyment. He also has an armload of awards.But, the real star of this film is Ed Masry played brilliantly by Albert Finney (Amazing Grace, Murder on the Orient Express, The Dresser, Tom Jones, Under the Volcano).

      "Based on the true story of a woman who overcame all adversity and single-handedly dragged down a power company, Erin Brockovich tells the story a single mother (played by Julia Roberts), rejected from yet another job, but after an unfortunate car crash, she manages to argue her way into a job at Albert Finney's law firm. She soon discovers murky goings-on regarding a small town's water supply, causing disease and death. Most people would sit back and leave it, but Erin doesn't, instead, she dedicates the next few years of her life to righting the wrongs.Many have found Roberts' performance grating, but I personally thought she was excellent in the lead, embodying all the key qualities of the character, both good and bad; she is caring and determined, yet impatient and foul-mouthed. Unlike many of the female leads presented in films today, what is so appealing to me about her performance is just how human it is. Her role is one very far removed for her usually romcomy turns, and all for the better. In the support, Albert Finney is amusing in a bumbling yet togethered role, and the two make a fitting pair. Donna Jensen, Aaron Eckhart and Cherry Jones also give notable performances.Their work is made much easier with Steven Soderburgh's capable yet efficient direction, and some nimble dialogue, supplied by Susannah Grant. Even if we do have a good idea about which direction the movie will head, the cast and crew work deftly to make us experience the movie as well as enjoy it, so that the redemption, when it comes, means even more. The modern-day atmosphere is also captured well, in background design, as well as a catchy electro-funk soundtrack from Thomas Newman.Fuelled mainly by its excellent performances, Erin Brockovich is a strange combination of genres. It is a biography of a woman that nobody had heard of. It is a drama as far as the seriousness of topic. And it is also a comedy, in how it so effortlessly captures the essence of a determined, brave, and kind-hearted woman. But essentially, Erin Brockovich is a feel-good David and Goliath story, of how the weak defeated the strong. It has its flaws (a slow middle act, some sketchy characters, as well as the question of how true to the facts it plays), but generally, it handles its subject matter with appropriate integrity, yet making it accessible to cinema-goers. Uplifting, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable, Erin Brockovich is not to be missed. 0.2007418205377389\n",

      "\"Erin Brokovich\" is a slick, big budget, A-List movie starring Julia Roberts. But it's not your typical Julia Roberts vehicle, in other words, it's not a romantic comedy. \"Erin Brokovich\" is a docu-drama, the material seemingly more attuned to an HBO made-for-TV movie than a weekend opener. But in the hands of Steven Soderberg, a very watchable movie is the result. Very watchable, but in my opinion, not deserving all the Oscar attention it got in 2001.My gripe is two-fold. First, there is no real drama, no tension. Everything the heroine attempts works out great. Finds a job, finds an understanding boyfriend, gets the bad guys, gets rich. Maybe that's how it went down in real life, but it's not very dramatic (or comedic).Secondly, even though this is not a romantic comedy it is still very much a Julia Roberts flick. Her smile and body (especially her breasts) are on constant display. This flick is her show through and through and everyone else is just a prop.So, does this make it a bad movie?

I suddenly got to see a beaufiful film set in a part of the world I'd never been to and see this woman who is a single mother and seems down and out, have so much courage and bravery. Like a lioness. And then to still be at ease with her vanity and let you deal with it and not have any qualms with how she was perceived. Wow. Julia Roberts nails it. One of her careee defining performances. 0.0146031746031746\n",
      "This film is amazing. It is definitely one of my Top Ten favorite films of ALL time!! I can not see a single flaw in this films acting, writing or directing. (even if they have goofs, those don't count)If you like Julia Roberts you will LOVE her after seeing her in this role.Anyone who says that this film is slow only watches action films. Erin Brockovich has perfect pace, the only thing i wish is that there would be a sequel or that the film would just keep going. If you have not seen this film it will be the best informational film you have ever seen, you can have fun watching and learn about environmental problems all at once.I actually give this film an 11 out of 10!! 0.2756138392857143\n",
      "I have always been a Julia Roberts Fan, but this movie in particular inspired me to no end. Erin Brockovich is one of the toughest, most determined women I have know. My daughter and I were going through some rough times when a couple of years ago. Every time we thought we were at our lowest, we would pop in this DVD. She always got our feet back on the ground, and we realized life wasn't so bad. Because of this movie I have gone back to school and am studying to become a paralegal. If she can do this, with all the obstacles she had going against her, then I told my self I can as well. Thank you Erin for allowing this story. I am sure I will never obtain what you have, but it will be a profession that I can be proud of. 0.1240740740740741\n",
      "This is one of those films you buy on DVD when you're building your collection. The fact I've got it on DVD shows it was released when i was building my DVD collection. Having said that it's not a bad film and is certainly Julia Roberts finest moment to date. When we first meet Erin she's struggling to make ends meet and hoping to make some money from a compensation claim. Once that goes astray she gets a job from her solicitor Ed Masry (Albert Finney) because he screwed up. People like Erin because she is normal and she becomes embroiled in a case against a multinational company. 0.24107142857142855\n",
      "I shamefully didn't believe that Julia Roberts could bring so much to the role of Erin Brockovich...but she was incredible - it must have had something to do with playing opposite Albert Finney.

It's inspiring AND funny AND entertaining AND well-written,...AND--I say that the Oscar nomination in THIS one's GOT to go to Albert Finney. He's absolutely hysterical.

      "\"May contain Spoiler information\"The film is a story about overcoming odds, environmental pollution, and corporate deception. It is also about the persistence and struggles encountered in uncovering and exposing the truth. The central insight of this film pits right against wrong and a huge corporation against a couple individuals. It's the David vs. Goliath of corporate environmental contamination where power and influence are annulled and the truth eventually triumphs.Down on her luck and down to her last dime Erin Brokovich (played by Julia Roberts) a twice divorced single mother of three is involved in an automobile accident which leads to meeting attorney Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney). After losing her case in court and not receiving any type of settlement, Erin basically extorts a job from her attorney Ed Masry. Erin is asked to review some pro –bono files for Masry. While reviewing these files she is puzzled as to why medical records are being kept with real estate files. As she uncovers these answers Erin begins her long and tireless quest becoming the unlikely advocate to the citizens of Hinckley, CA in her epic fight against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) a powerful multinational corporation.Directed by Steven Soderbuergh and written by Susannah Grant this film is based on the true to life story of Erin Brokovich and the landmark case of environmental contamination and corporate cover up. The film focuses on the good vs. evil and the David vs. Goliath struggle where one, down on her luck uneducated girl through her passion, and tireless pursuit of truth, brings down one the country's largest corporations.This film in broad context is similar to other films such as \"The Rain Maker\" \"the entire President's Men\" and \"The Firm\" Where individuals face great struggles as they battle against and overcome insurmountable odds.By using various techniques Soderbuergh builds a relationship with the viewer where it is difficult not to cheer for Erin and her clients. As a viewer we watch the action through an objective view point as the plot develops. Soderbuergh uses a subjective view point in establishing and building the relationship between Erin and her clients. This perspective brings the audience in closer and forces us to experience the intimacy and intensity of each moment. Sounds effects were used effectively to subconsciously instill or associate the feeling of danger and suspense. I believe the music, sounds and editing were all carefully constructed to create a feeling with the viewers to relate to Erin and her clients and build on that desire to see them succeed in the battle.I believe that the film works because the writing, directing and acting is believable which allows us to identify and side with the little man. We want this woman, who has had a hard life to beat the odds and succeed, and we also feel for innocent victims of the town and we hope that they win their battle against their illness and against the evil big corporation.I enjoy this film and would give it 9 out of 10 0.02172619047619048\n",
      "I gotta be honest although I think this film was a nice film, it wasn't spectacular, it wasn't all that great, but it was nice. I say that because I saw it on Cable-TV and not in the movie houses. I would not have PAID to see it in the movie house frankly, it was on the level of many nice films I saw on the Lifetime Cable Networks Made for TV movies. That about sums it up for me.I liked the idea of a low income working single female almost living in a trailer park sticking it to the big corporation, but I've seen it before, over and over, on movies of the week...**yawn**. Julia Roberts' performance was...fine. Nothing to write home to mom about, and even more, why in the things of all that is Holy did she win an Oscar for this? Was the Academy saying this is the best she can do? I doubt that. Anyone could have done this film, Big whoop. A nice film, but nothing more than that. 0.4571428571428571\n",
      "Though \"Erin\" is not a movie to be pegged as romance, law drama, politically correct in it's language (hey, it is rated R!) or action. It is based on real life and states it in the first seconds of the movie, therefore is not going to be packed with any of these things.I loved it. You learn about Erin and her situation, her family, her career, (her cleavage) and her personal life. I felt her ups and downs and never forgot that this really happened. After learning all this, you end up rooting for her! I and the audience around me seemed to all agree that this is one to see! 0.22321428571428573\n",

      "Erin Brockovich would have been a compelling drama even if it weren't a true story, but it is a true story, so it's even more captivating.

This film makes you laugh almost as much as it tugs at your heartstrings, and it's deserving of all the praise it gets. 0.37777777777777777\n",
      "While I appreciate that the story is interesting and an example of the little guy winning for a change and in the real world too, I personally didn't think that much of this film. I'm not sure why it was raved about so much apart from Julia's brilliant performance.I don't think we saw enough of the woman Erin used to be, before she became so successful and I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the legal process and court scenes to make it more understandable and provide some light and shade. It was obvious that there was going to be issues with the boyfriend and kids, but I'd like to have seen it brewing a bit more, again to create some balance, although with that said, it is a really long story and more than a little bit drawn out.I think the real Erin must be an amazing woman and I'm glad that her story has been told, but I don't think we got to see enough of her in this one and I don't just mean her cameo in the diner.The supporting actors were very good, I've always had a soft spot for Albert for some reason and he played his part well and Aaron looked particularly tasty.I'm not sure what was missing from this film that would have made it better for me, but I wouldn't tell others not to bother with it, because I can see some of its appeal. 0.24967171717171716\n",
      "I found Erin Brockovich to be one of the best, amazing and realistic films I have ever seen. Julia Roberts puts on the performance of a lifetime, and boy, does she shine! The film is full of effort, and it was written by the same person who wrote 28 Days, Susannah Grant, who really deserves an Oscar for such brilliant screenwriting. Steven Soderbergh also deserves praise for his effort in making this terrific and amazing film.Erin Brockovich is an awesome drama with alot of comedy and tragedy to keep you glued to the screen the whole time.

The directing of Steven Soderbergh and the score composed by Thomas Newman create a real universe which accompanies J. Roberts in all the movie.\n",

      "Light, funny, with one-liners that hit the note. Almost a feel-good movie for women who feel down-on-luck & life in general. Not overloaded with melodrama, this is not a chick-flick but some male-bashing is involved. Of course Brockovich's choice of necklines has been marketed to reel the guys in, but I see it as a part of the character and not merely there to boost sales. I congratulate Julia Roberts for fishing out yet another movie that appeals to the masses. 0.13000000000000003\n"

      "Erin Brockovich played an integral role in the fight against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) in an environmental lawsuit despite her lack of legal knowledge prior to the case. Brockovich, a single mother in pursuit of a job to support her family, found herself working in the office of her lawyer as a legal clerk where she first learned about the case. She was an underdog who through her own determination was able to successfully fight for the justice of the people who were affected by PG&E's contamination of Hinkley's water with toxic chromium. This film was enjoyable to watch, not only because of the appeal of an underdog movie, but also because of the fact that it was based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (2000) is a perfect balance between raw drama and biography. The film is heartwarming and raw, but puts you on the edge of your seat at times which keeps it entertaining. The educational aspect of the film was well-complemented by the dramatization of her personal life, making it entertaining to watch without toying with the historical accuracy of the case. The film contained accurate and useful information about environmental law so for those who are interested in environmental law this film is the right choice! While watching the film I learned about the social and environmental impacts harsh chemicals that can come from factories can have. I am glad I watched this film because it has helped me become more informed not only on the 1993 lawsuit, but also on the impact that large companies can have on the environment. This film makes you think about all of the loopholes that companies can go through: How much are these companies getting away with?Julia Roberts, who plays the role of Erin Brockovich, played the role very well. Julia Roberts is known to play some roles that require the portrayal of a lot of raw, blunt emotion. In her role as Erin Brockovich, Roberts is able to illustrate the fire and compassion within Brockovich as she fights to help the people of the town of Hinkley. As a viewer of the film I really believed her performance and could feel how much Brockovich's kids impacted her life at the time. Not only is she passionate about her children, but she is also passionate about a case she learns about while sorting files at her job in a law firm office. I could sympathize with Erin in her pursuit of a job, and could understand even before she truly dug into the case, how passionate she was about helping others. Erin becomes so invested in the case, that she travels in order to get more information than what was written in the files. In the film we see how her passion for advocacy propels her further into the case, and how it impacts other aspects of her life that are not shown as often in the film.As I watched Erin Brockovich (2000) I tried to pick out the parts that I thought were truthful, and the parts that were not truthful. As the film went on I had to remind myself that each crazy aspect of this story happened in real life-- with a few exceptions. Although parts of the film were embellished for the screen, I am confident that the film stayed true to Erin Brockovich's roots and portrayed her story accurately throughout the majority of the film. In fact, after watching the film I was able to fact check many scenes of the film, which I was surprised to find true. This film did a great job at portraying not only Erin's role in the case, but also the vulnerable aspects of Erin's life at the time of the lawsuit. I was so inspired. The relatable nature of the film makes it something that viewers want to see. The story of Erin Brockovich is portrayed in-full. The mundane, personal aspects of the film remind us that Erin Brockovich at the time was a person just like the rest of us, which I found particularly inspiring.This film was dramatic without overwhelming the viewer with action. It was a calming film to watch because of the light-hearted aspects which were weaved in with the dramatic parts that put me on the edge of my seat. As a viewer, I felt relieved by the progress Erin was making throughout the film, and felt for her when there were hard times; a sign that I was truly invested.Seeing the detrimental impacts of what the Pacific Gas and Electric Company did to the town of Hinkley was disheartening, but Eric Brockovich's actions were inspiring. Seeing that someone without an educational law background was able to persist, and be so passionate about something in order to really make a difference in the lives of many people is inspiring and heartwarming. 0.1825363825363825\n",
      "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. This film shows what hard work and determination can accomplish. Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a true advocate for justice. Her persistence in trying to achieve justice makes others try to achieve it as well. This film does justice to the issue of mandatory minimums by showing that the \"small\" person can rise up and make things happen. Just like Erin Brockovich, Julie Stewart was someone who rose up to a challenge and has been fighting for its just resolution. Erin was the main character and therefore provided the strength for the film. Her fiery demeanor gets the audience riled up and interested in the film and her cause. The basic plot of the film is that while working at a law firm, Erin tries to win a case concerning a water contamination scandal. Every time you hear victims of the contamination speak about their illnesses, it moves your heart. Some of the victims are even children. One scene that truly portrays Erin's determination is when she climbs down into a well to gather water samples. She is risking a lot by doing this because she could get arrested and the evidence she acquires could become voided. Nevertheless, she evades the men that chase her off the property. After going to PG&E, the water company of the film, she and her family receive a threatening call. If she did not have devotion to justice, Erin could have stopped investigation on this case, but she continued to investigate because of her dedication to bringing justice to the people affected by PG&E. Another compelling scene involves a lawyer, Theresa, and Erin. Theresa insults Erin's work involving the case. She says that Erin had holes in her investigation, but Erin insists that her investigation is more than thorough. Theresa claims that Erin is missing six hundred and some odd telephone numbers, but what she does not know is that Erin is so connected to the case that she memorized all of those numbers. She also memorized all of the illnesses and things that the contaminated water had caused. Erin has formed relationships with the people who were affected by the contamination, and this case became personal to her. Her commitment to justice is just as passionate as Julie Stewart's devotion to bringing mandatory minimum to an end. Erin was just doing her job to try to provide for her family. What she did not know was that she would become so passionate about this issue that she would neglect spending time with her family. She also missed the chance to develop a relationship with a man named George who had been so good with her children. While she was at work he always watched the kids. He eventually left Erin because he could not stand not being able to spend time with her. This multi-million case caused Erin to spend over a year investigating, and she missed her youngest daughter's first words. A very powerful scene is when George goes into detail about her youngest daughter's first word. Erin begins to cry as George sounds so excited about Beth's first word. Erin wanted to bring justice to this case, but in the process, she missed spending time with her family. She had to sacrifice time, and her son began to resent her for that. Near the end, though, Erin's son was able to understand the significance of this case, and he no longer thought that his mother was abandoning him. George also came back. The very end of the film is the scene that best encapsulates the lesson of the story. At the very end of the movie, Erin's boss gives her a very large amount of money, two-million dollars. Her boss at first said that the sum of money that they had both agreed on was inappropriate. Erin thought that he was screwing her over and that he meant he was giving her a lesser amount of money. She begins to yell at him but she stops when she picks up the check he put on her desk. It is a check for two-million dollars, and Erin is speechless. Her boss says that he felt that her work deserved more, and the initial amount proposed was inappropriate. Thus, he gave her more money. She was rewarded for doing justice. The reward for doing justice may not always be material, but highly valuable. With this one case, Erin learned work ethic, perseverance, and along the line, self respect. She gains a sense of self confidence after she works on this case, and she feels that more people respect her as well. Although she lost some time with her family, Erin learned many life lessons. Justice in this film is very apparent through Erin's devotion and connection to her clients. Dedication to justice, perseverance, relationships, and a willingness to help others at all costs allows Erin to close this case and bring justice to her clients. 0.21360355253212396\n",

In the case of Erin Brockovitch, it truly is the latter. It's well acted, produced and directed. The storyline is one of the finest Hollywood has taken and created into film with a professional time-served cast to carry it from beginning to end. What swearing there is has justification and fits well without it being out and loud in every other line. What's more, Erin's fight to pursue a career with running a family can be identified by many single parents everywhere. What isn't there to like about this film?

Riddled with sex, violence and swearing, implying every Police Officer is either corrupt or gun-happy or that every white person is a racist hyena, whilst all other races are victims doesn't make for quality films - Erin Brockovitch, although made in 2000, still shines as an example of what Hollywood can hit the world with, without pandering to violence and gunfire. 0.11197478991596638\n",

      "Erin Brockovich is a movie that has become iconic over the years. Movie gets viewers' attention by being based on real life events, the famous cast promises a great performance, and the best part is that it does not disappoint and leaves a very warm feeling after watching.Erin Brockovich (portrayed by Julia Roberts) is an unemployed, single mother of 3 with no prospects of a stable job. She is vigorous, decisive and will not shy away from problems. As if she had not enough on her plate, Erin gets injured in a car accident. Trying to get compensation she hires a lawyer Ed Marsy (Albert Finney) who is a partner in a small law firm. The case seems to be an easy triumph, however because of Erin's ability to easily stir up trouble, she ends up without any compensation (which is hard to believe).She gilts Ed into hiring her. As one of the assignments she gets files on a case where Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers to buy a house from a land nearby their manufacturers. Erin gets suspicious and starts her own investigations which provides her with interesting information. It turns out that PS&EC has been polluting the area with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium which has a devastating effect on resident's health.She believes that company has been aware of implications but prioritised profit over people's lives. Erin is determined to expose the wrongdoing, so Ed and her start to act. As they explain to residents that stakes are high, they convince everyone to get on board with pursuing arbitration. Not everything boils down to finding proof that PS&EC knew about chromium exposure and its lasting impact on people's health. Luckily, one of the residents approaches Erin and says that he used to work for PS&EC and was tasked to destroy documents that can be used to confront the company. With those documents PS&EC does not stand a chance in court and is ordered to pay a settlement of more than $300 million.It's hard to tell how much of the movie is true and which parts were added for a dramatic effect. Even though the story is funny, touching and attracts sympathy. Even though it is a movie about a law case, the viewer does not see too many courtroom scenes or legal terms. It tries to show the real people, their lives and problems they faced, something that people in white shirts sitting in skyscrapers have failed to see. Erin's determination to help them wins admiration. However, there are some things that raise questions. Julia Roberts' goes through so many outfits and looks stunning that you may sometimes forget about her life circumstances. But you cannot blame someone for being too pretty, moreover she is incredible in the role. The other thing is how they got required evidence. Watching the movie, I kept thinking that the main reason the former worker gave them documents was to get attention from Erin and be a bigger man in her eyes.Nevertheless, the movie is definitely worth watching especially during those days when you need to renew your faith in people. 0.17628603822481373\n",
      "Erin Brockovich is a film based on the legal wranglings headed by Erin Brockovich representing residents of a California town against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a down on her luck former beauty pageant winner who is a twice divorced mother of three small children. She is trying her best to find a job and put food on the table when she is involved in an automobile accident. Erin hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to represent her in her lawsuit against the other driver. Because of her scantily clad wardrobe and smart mouth she doesn't win the lawsuit but she is able to win a job in Ed's law firm.The first big assignment Erin is assigned is researching a pro bono real estate case. Erin stumbles across medical records in file and begins to dig deeper into the situation as to what the significance of medical records are in a real estate file. She finds out that PG&E has been illegally dumping a very toxic chemical into the town's water system. PG&E had been secretly trying to buy all of the real estate surrounding their plant. Erin ends up meeting numerous people who had become ill because of the contamination. This leads to one of the largest lawsuits against a corporation and ended with a record $333 million reward. Although things work out in the end for Erin, she researches and fights this battle for two years. Missing out on milestones that her own children attain and possibly sabotaging a good relationship.The movie was nominated for over 40 awards in 2000 and 2001, wining approximately half of them. Julia Roberts gave one of her best performances to date playing the sympathetic law firm employee who had the clients' best interest at heart. She was adamant that these citizens needed to be compensated for the lifelong health problems they now have because of the carelessness of a PG&E. The movie shows that there are people who are willing to fight for the rights of others even if their own life is briefly interrupted to do so.Both the lighting and angles give this movie a warm feeling and help you feel like you personally know the characters and the problems they are going through. You can't help but feel sorry for them when you hear their stories and be happy when they finally win their case.If you like movies with the same theme as Erin Brockovich, which is helping others, you may also like A Time to Kill (1996) about a lawyer who puts his family life on hold and in danger to represent an accused murderer. As well as Patch Adams (1998) about a doctor who only wants to help his patients any way necessary much to the dislike of his colleagues. 0.19167529330572808\n",

Her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney) assigns her to case files. Erin finds medical records inside real estate records and asks permission to investigate. She visits the people involved and finds various medical conditions associated with the people living near the plant and PG&E were paying the doctors expenses.The safety violations involved hiding hexavalent chromium from the contamination report to the local community in Hinkley, California. PG&E Hinkley, California used cooling towers as an anti-corrosive step which dumped contaminated chromium-6 into shallow ponds that were not lined. Then, chromium-6 leaked into the ground water devastating many more than the 634 people awarded a total settlement of $333 million dollars.Documents discovered by a whistleblower showed that the corporate PG&E office in San Francisco was aware chromium-6 had been leaking into the ground water since the 1960s from the Hinkley cooling towers. The document stated \"the water is poisonous but it would be better for all involved if it was not discussed\" with the Hinkley, California PG&E neighbors. It was also a shock to learn the waterboard in Hinkley, California was aware and they did nothing. At the end of the movie it was announced there was another chromium-6 law suit against PG&E in Kettleman Hills, California.PG&E claims they no longer use hexavalent chromium in any of their compressor plants and that all of their holding ponds are lined to prevent groundwater contamination. 0.030092592592592584\n",

Near the town was a plant owned by a Californian utility company. This film traces the link between the running of the plant and the local people who became sick, and is based on a true story.Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts in an award-winning performance) worked as a filing clerk in a small legal firm and she was the one who initially suspected something was wrong. She made many visits to Hinkley and interviewed the people there. And she found out about the toxic chemical Chromium 6, used at the plant as a rust inhibitor, which had leached into the groundwater.The story which unfolds has a mix of investigation, cover-up, and intrigue. And in the end crucial company documents, thought shredded, appear. The company eventually paid a $333 million settlement to the affected people in Hinkley.Part of what made all of this so extraordinary was that Erin was not a lawyer and had very limited legal experience.

      "Julia Roberts' feisty performance spearheads this fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable film about Erin Brockovich, an uneducated single mother of obvious resource who cracked her way into a job in a law firm and then cracked a big corporate liability case. The picture is engaging both because of the depiction of Brockovich's persona and for the case itself, which is told engrossingly by Steven Soderbergh from Susannah Grant's script. The biographical elements of the film place themselves neatly in the biopic tradition, complete with relations that start off abrasively but end (bitter)sweetly. Roberts and Eckhart don't look that persuasive as lovers, but then again, that may have been the point. And although the Roberts/Finney relation telegraphs its warmth and compassion long in advance, it does the trick. Roberts became the first actress ever to win both an Academy Award, BAFTA, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review, and Screen Actors Guild Award for one and the same performance. 0.22190476190476188\n",

However i was very pleased with Albert Finney's performance, my favorite of the flick, he stole his scenes.

      "If you had told me that, years after I last watched Erin Brockovich (directed by Steven Soderbergh) with my mother on VHS, that I would like it more than Soderbergh's Traffic I probably wouldn't have believed you. It's quite impressive that he released both films in 2000 which I didn't know until now.Directly after the release of 2017's Wonder Woman (directed by Patty Jenkins) there was a general sentiment that women finally had a true female superhero movie, summed up for me by a friend of a friend's post on social media talking about what she saw as the key difference between male and female superheroes; that the former often \"saves the world\" because it's the right thing to do whereas the latter tends to \"save the world\" as a byproduct of maternalistic instincts. For her it implied an ethical inferiority that female superheroes needed an endangered child to fuel their heroism.At the time I thought it was an over-exaggerated reading of the roles, since it's not exactly uncommon that male superheroes do what they do because of romantic forces driving their heroism. In hindsight I admit that this friend of a friend had a point.Erin Brockovich isn't the story of a superhero but it's perhaps the best example of a female hero doing what's right for its own sake and it goes even further than that because Erin Brockovich does the right thing at the direct expense of her maternalistic instincts. She doesn't fight for an entire community's justice because one of her kids also got sick or anything like that and due to her workload and efforts she risks alienating her children and even destroys a relationship with a man in the process of this story. I don't know of any other film like it, in that respect.By contrast, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman had no husband or children and so the fact that she \"saves the world\" for its own sake is made redundant because she has no maternal instinct to ignore and act in spite of.While Erin Brockovich on its surface is a quintessential 'feminist film' it also turns the 'workaholic husband and alienated wife' trope in on itself, by placing a woman in the role of workaholic and a man in the role of unloved and alienated, which makes for some very interesting material. The film has us so engaged with Erin Brockovich's mission that we're not prepared for when her love interest doesn't understand the importance of her long work hours and why he feels hurt and alienated to the point of wanting to leave her.This is something very few films try to convey, possibly because most films with this trope are geared towards a male audience and so we're just expected to side with the overworked husband. However, in this film Erin takes George (her love interest) with her to inform one of the sick townspeople that all their work has paid off and they will be receiving a payout of $5 million and before she does so, she tells him that this is what he helped her achieve by staying home and taking care of the kids all those lonely nights.I wonder how many destroyed relationships would have remained intact if only the workoholic husband had shown his wife what she had helped to achieve by doing what needed to be done to allow him to work so much? People are much more content with sacrifice when they know it was for something, but why would anybody stick around if they think they suffered through alienation just so their husband could help their employers make more money?As an aside, I really love the tone of this film. It captures a kind of blue-collar desperation and while the feminist overtones are very obvious, what truly resides at Erin Brockovich's core is a tale about classism and overcoming the forces of polite society, summed up perfectly for me when Erin Brockovich is told to wear longer skirts by the women in the office. 0.15380952380952384\n",

Not only was the acting and storyline exceptional, the movie presented a very real yet distressing enviornmental crisis case to life. .

      "Most great movies have maybe three magic scenes and the duds nothing memorable. This film has half a dozen scenes where the look, timing and script provides a volcanic moment. Julia Roberts is in all of them. The almost last scene where she receives her bonus cheque and is at last left speechless is classic. Albert Finley's shuffle exit referring to 'beauty queens being taught to apologise ' is always worth waiting for.

      "This film is a great opportunity to realize how simple empathy and indifference to people around in our everyday routine may influence and change someone's life for the better. \"Erin Brockovich\" is based on a true story of a young, provocatively looking and irascible woman copes with uncovering devastating actions of a local company.The movie starts with a scene of a car accident which involved a woman - Erin Brockovich. Julia Roberts, as always, did an amazing job in acting and presenting the main character - a divorced single mother of three, provocatively dressed and with no prospects of a stable job, but hard-working, strong-willed and, what is equally important, sympathetic. The first scene brings Erin to a lawyer office in which later on by blackmailing the lawyer (Ed Masry) she starts working. After a while her work boils down to a case of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) planning to purchase the home in Hinkley, California. The most striking feature of the case - it includes medical records of a family from Hinkley. By digging for more information, uncovering legal papers and meeting people from Hinkley, who experienced an irreversible lasting impact of uncontrollably used chromium by the PG&E on their health, Erin Brockovich manages to put together a lawsuit and sounds the alarm of the company's dangerous actions which let all hell break loose and cause PG&E's distress. However, with a help of a lawyer she works for and deep trust from plaintiffs of the lawsuit, Erin successes not only in exposing wrongdoing, but also getting tangible results in helping people such as financial compensation.Finally, \"Erin Brockovich\" is a biopic which raises a problem of whistleblowers and puts an emphasize on sacrifices and challenges they expected to face with and courage they usually have predisposition to which regularly cause social contradictions. In the movie Erin is a woman that generally isn't taken seriously by her employers and colleges. However, it is she who has enough courage and will to make a lasting difference to PG&E's wrongdoing by prioritizing her and her children's peaceful lives over health and happiness of complete strangers. Although the film ends happily, you may think of several examples of the latest whistleblowers who seems to be judged a lot, but their intents and positive effects are not mentioned enough. In such conditions, I am convinced, our attitudes towards such people should be changed in order to focus on the results society gets more than on benefits of interested parties. 0.13580064380064383\n",
      "WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERSErin Brockovich is a well done and quite enjoyable movie, even if it does blatantly shout at the screen `give me an Oscar'. It's directed by Steven Soderbergh, who won an Oscar that same year for Traffic. So if you like his cool, hip style of directing then you'll probably like this film.Julia Roberts takes on the lead role and I'll give the devil its due, she gives a very convincing performance. But then again she was well overdue for one. Her performances in her usual run-of-the-mill rom-coms were giving me a strong sense of déjà vu. I still think that she's far from being the best actress of all time but this film has brought her one step closer. Albert Finney easily fits into the role of Erin's jolly despondent boss and seems to be enjoying it, for what it's worth. Newcomer Aaron Eckhart takes on a rather unrealistic role but does a good job of it.I'll admit I don't like films like The Parallax View and Arlington Road where the bad guys win but nonetheless, `Erin Brockovich' could have done with a bit of opposition from the company she was sueing.The film isn't exactly complex and lacks emotional power but it's still a brilliant film that holds your attention and has a very satisfying ending. 0.2246212121212122\n",

There is tremendous ensemble acting in this company and every actor adds to the creation of a very compelling and engaging movie.

      "It's always good a little introduction about the writer to put things in perspective. I've watched about 20 movies in the last 2 years. Before that, 1 movie per week. I've missed big movies and I'm from somewhere between Generation X and Y.Every actor plays a great role in it. I don't know much of each one past works, but even Julia Roberts seems like she is playing the first role in her career this time. Except she is now 30 and not 20 anymore.It starts showing, quickly, how bad she was in life in that moment. Not one second she gives up, but specially in the beginning, not one second she stops smiling at life even while life throw her away to the dump. That's until she gets of a job interview, broke, with 3 kids, divorced twice and suffer a car accident. Now she can't smile that easily anymore... But, that's one thing in the movie... She doesn't know what's going to happen, but definitely never give up. And that's just the first 7 minutes.The movie has 2 sides. At one side, there is a big case of corruption in PSE&G, the American supplier of gas and electricity. At the other side there is a bright woman, fighting to stay alive and getting life to push her in the hard way into solving that case. And she proves to be able to do the job and still keeping herself as a pretty woman, as she likes that.Along with that, there is, in each part of the movie, smart words being used. It starts pretty fast, then it slows down a little to normal to show details about the story itself. But while it slows down, it still keeps with some details about how's a good way to live life, specially added by Charlie, who seems like an angel, plus the smart way how Erin moves her life, almost unconsciously.--- spoiler --- While watching the movie I've cried, without knowing the reason, for the first time in my short 24 year old life. Other than that, I've only did it in funerals. It was when her child asked what was going on, why she was out of home for 18 months, and they could understand each other by using just a few words. Amazing kid.Despite of how real the story evolving PSE&G really is the movie gives one feeling of evil company. But I rather see it the other image the movie also shows which is PSE&G just acting as a big company who has human making mistakes, blinded by money and by keeping distance from reality. There's no specific scene showing that, but the movie as a whole does. 0.10403906792795682\n",

      "Made at the time Julia Roberts was the top acress on the planet Erin Brockovich is a reminder of the actress's immense charisma and talent. It helps that the director is the supremely talented Steven Soderberg. Erin Brockovich was a unique legal thriller in that, during an era when overplotted and contrived stories like those of John Grisham defined the genre, it wasn't littered with throw-away plot devices designed exclusively to generate tension. With only a minor exception, Erin is not followed by shadowy figures. She does not become the target of violence and terroristic threats. With a performance that shows off both her comic and dramatic aptitude, Roberts brings the title character to life with a zest and intensity that may surprise viewers who have pigeonholed her into the romantic comedy mold. Albert Finney is excellent here. Their scenes together crackle with electricity, and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. 0.24010416666666667\n",

Just a couple of days before watching this film, i watched Notting Hill, and now i can honestly say im a hardened Julia Roberts fan. But more importantly is the film itself, playing a woman who came from such a disfuncional existance, to becoming such a well respected woman has to be something to admire, her sheer determination and guts to stand up to anyone who questioned what she thought was right is how she became successfull in her own beliefs, and none of this was done for self gratification, but for the rights of the people, and to give her daughter the life she didn't have, good on her 0.3617216117216117\n",
      "ERIN BROCKOVICH- no introduction needed here, I guess, the enormous publicity campaign has done its job. As most stories which are based 'on a true story', this one deals with a poor woman, who stays herself and is able to do good work and become very rich at the same time. Julia Roberts is finally starring in a film, where the story isn't about being a love-interest or chasing one. And surprisingly she is well cast and doing a good job. She is emotional and aggressive when she ought to be, with the right amount of it, not overdoing, or lacking conviction. Also Albert Finney as the lawyer is at his best. The only thing in this film that raises question marks is Erin Broccoli's boyfriend; what is he doing there, and why does he stick around (he is her housekeeper and nanny)? And perhaps this film is a bit longish to some taste. There is not much what can be said about the film, it has everything one expects from it, a bit of laughter, a few tears, a happy ending. Not anything in particular that makes it a 'must see' on the big screen. It is a very good TV film. ** 1/2 out of five 0.3047562358276644\n",
      "\"Erin Brockovich\" is based on the true story of a single mother of three who successfully brought a civil action against a corporate firm guilty of poisoning the water of a small-town community.  Despite a formulaic plot and gathering of near-stereotypical supporting characters, the film succeeds through a good mix of comedy and drama.The film opens with Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) unsuccessfully trying to get a job at a hospital before breaking her neck in a car accident.  After failing to get compensation, she bullies her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) into taking her on as an assistant at his firm.  Whilst there, she discover some alarming evidence about a gas and electrics company, poisoned water and the illness-stricken residents the backwater village...Technically, the film works using early Nineties songs to liven up moments where Erin is investigating and enhances the mundane, everyday feel of the picture.  The film is also well-edited, making alot of the scientific and legal jargon simple and digestible.  It is never unclear to the attentive viewer exactly what is going on and why.Performances are excellent.  Julia Roberts deservedly won an Oscar for her winning portrayal of Erin: she's sarcastic, no-nonsense but not unsympathetic. There are times when she plays character as a little too nasty to the point where she nearly loses audience empathy. She's balanced out by Albert Finney as her harassed but honest boss who's not afraid to put her in her place from time to time.  Aaron Eckhardt turns in a fine performance as Erin's loyal but neglected biker boyfriend.  The interaction between these three characters forms the movie's core.It is in the script and story that \"Erin Brockovich\" very nearly falls down. Beyond the three central characters, no character is given any degree of depth and come very close to stereotyping on several occasions.  The people Erin helps out are honest but helpless victims; the corporation she's up against composed of and aided by greedy or inhuman opportunists and the lawyers who eventually help Erin and Ed are played as patronising and cynical.  It is an interesting but unambiguous stock of characters.There are currently allegations surfacing that the real Erin and Ed actually duped the Hinkley residents and the water was not as poisonous as was claimed in the case.  This has created an ambiguity around Erin Brockovich that would have been interesting to explore in the movie.Nevertheless, if you enjoy a good people-power flick, or want an example of some fine acting and drama, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this. 0.14075565687267816\n",
      "Don't be deceived. I really don't believe there is all that much to like about this flick. If you empathize with in-your-face abrasive characters with mega chips on their shoulders, then Julia Roberts' character is going to come over as 'ballsy' and 'brassy' to you.If you find that kind of attitude just too 80's to be at all endearing anymore, then her character is just going to come over as plain rude, hostile and largely detached from anyone else's feelings except other people who've had a hard hard time.Whilst the story may be true, it was profoundly dull, played out with little sense of suspense or tension building, and quite frankly is better suited to a 1 hour documentary than a 2 and a half hour snore of a cinematic effort. 0.0409313725490196\n",

      "This story was truly inspiring. I see the real Erin Brokovich hosting a show on Lifetime about women like herself these days. Anywho, the movie was a tad bit too long, but was a good film in itself. I liked the personal aspects of her family going sour as her aspirations and goals move up. That's often very true when a woman is trying to make something of herself with a family in tow. The story was just amazing. I thought Roberts was good, but all she did was cuss a lot, which doesn't take great acting because we all want to sometime. I think the character just allowed Roberts to speak what she would probably say if she wasn't who she was, if that makes any sense. Finney was marvelous and an engaging character who's scared to take on such a big challenge, but rises to the occasion. He kept it very real to me by not all of a sudden becoming all into the case. He took his time warming up to the idea that it could go somewhere. The cut and paste effect was a little lost on me and slowed down the already lengthy movie, but it was altogether good. A great message about not letting people take advantage of you and that there are some who are willing to fight for others.

Brockovich a try.  I'm sure this story would have made a nice 30 minute documentary on PBS, however, this did NOT make for an entertaining movie. Sure Julia was abrasive and carried her torch relentlessly, however this movie was simply dull.  There were no unexpected twists of plot, no unforgettable scenes, and the few moments of levity were forced in a cut and paste sort of way.  I'll spare everyone a plot summary because how much can one say about another tired, overdone story that centers around the common man standing up against the mighty corporate giant.  At least The Rainmaker had some excitement and didn't plod along in a boring, linear fashion like E. Brockovich did.  Frankly I don't know why Julia won an award for this role.

She said the \"F\" word in just about every sentence she used (that explains why this movie is rated R).

Julia played Erin character in a way that gave it a freshness and vitality that were necessary to show a story that reminded us a bible tale of a small David that faces the enormous Golias. In fact, the main character had to face two dangerous environments: big corporations and law courts.

Yes, as impossible as it is to believe the same man who gave us SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, OUT OF SIGHT, KING OF THE HILL, SCHIZOPOLIS, and THE LIMEY is responsible for yet another dumb Julia Roberts movie.  Uncannily bad acting, and a script that feels like a bad TV movie from the 70's.  One of the worst films of last year, so of course it's nominated for best picture.  Turns out the real Erin Brokovich is even dumber than the fictional version.  She just went bankrupt spending her entire $2 million on a dream house and drug rehabilitation.

      "Erin Brockovich is an inspiring movie about a single mother. The movies theme is that no matter who the opponent a person should stand for what is right. Erin has three children and is jobless and twice divorced and trying to make something of her life and provide a good life for her children. Erin Brockovich, Julie Roberts, is a stay at home mom who has no job skills because of her early marriage and her decision to stay at home with her children while her husband(s) worked and provided for the family. Six years later she is divorced and looking for a job to be able to support her three children.After being involved in a car accident she hires a small firm lawyer by the name of Ed Masry, Albert Finney, to represent her. The lawsuit does not go as planned and she is back to square one with not job and medical bills piling up from her injuries. She decides that she is going to talk Ed into giving her a job and accomplishes this by demanding that he hire her in front of the entire office. After working for Ed's law firm for a few weeks, Erin stumbles across a real estate case that has medical records in the file and decides to dig deeper.She discovers a cover-up that a large corporation, PG & E, has been trying to keep quiet while their statute of limitations runs out on their incident. The company had discovered that one of their plants has been leaking large amounts of a toxic chemical into the ground water and it has poisoned a whole town near the plant. PG & E has attempted to cover this up by attempting to purchase all of the land surrounding the plant that is now inhabited by the poisoned individuals. Erin pushes and researches this case. She fights for the people of the town. Ed's law firm takes on a big name partner and the two firms are able to bring a lawsuit against PG & E which is settled for an amount of $333 million. The amount was a national record for a settlement. The settlement is divided amongst the plaintiffs and Ed is able to move his law firm from their tiny little building into a downtown suite because of this case that they spearheaded. Erin fights for the people of the town throughout the film because it was what was right. To help convey the serious nature of the film lighting was vital for this movie. The lighting in the movie is very natural using high-key lighting thus making the film more real. The camera angle used through the majority of the film was medium shot. The medium shot also aided in the serious nature of this film. While the medium angle was used for the majority of the film for the intense debates between Erin and Ed, close-up shots were used to show the emotional responses of the characters (Boggs, 2008).A film with a similar theme is Legally Blonde. Even though these films handle their stories very differently in the end the themes are very similar. Both of the films focus on a woman who goes against the odds to take on a difficult challenge. They both take on the challenge because it is what is morally right and they will not bend. Both of the main characters are continually underestimated by people given their image and both prove them wrong.Resources Boggs, J. M. & Petric, D. W. (2008). The art of watching films. (7th ed).

      "I don't know how much of the \"based on a true story\" proviso is lip service, but the film's generally mild, sunny disposition at least FEELS like honesty. No one is ever particularly menacing or even mean to Ms. Roberts during her exertions, although there's a good deal of curt retorts along the way. The punchlines and feel-good moments are expected but welcome. The laughs are genuine. The ending is cute. Soderbergh plays the proceedings surprisingly straight for a change. No stunts, no gimmicks. \"All heart,\" I'm sure the marketers would hasten to add.

      "A solid, entertaining portrayal of a woman (who has absolutely nothing going for her except for heart and stubborn determination) fighting against incredible odds.  Erin Brockovich has every reason to give up the fight against a corporate giant who has successfully gotten away with polluting a small community's water for years.  But she will not give up.My only real problem with the movie is that it's a little too cute.  Albert Finney is cute, the biker boyfriend who loves little kids is cute, of course Julia Roberts is cute - even the streams of obscenities coming out of Julia Roberts mouth are cute.  You can't help but feel good after this movie, but the main characters are just so lovable you almost expect McDonald's to be handing out plush toys and Erin Brockovich happy meals.  Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie a lot.  But the characters and situations are a little bit too perfect to be believable. 0.3078525641025641\n",
      "I went to see Erin Brockovich expecting another cheap, cheesy Hollywood flick, but was pleasantly surprised by both Roberts' and Finney's portrayals.  Similar to Melanie Griffith's character in Working Girl, Roberts' character Erin Brockovich comes from the wrong side of town and is looking to improve her employment opportunities without the benefit of a college degree.  The big difference is that she does not sell out by dressing to please the Company Man, and her goal is not to make money for the Company, but to make the big-pocketed corporations pay for destroying the lives and health of the little guys.  Hopefully this is a sign of change in the moral climate from the 80's to the 00's. -0.09861111111111111\n",
      "This film is based on a true story.  Erin may have made some bad decisions down the road with men, but that does not have anything to do with a big corporation (PG & E) taking advantage of a small town.  Erin's quest to helping people is a sign of leadership.  I believe without raising her three children on her own, she would have not been capable to further investigate this case.  Any dumby with common sense would see that medical records and blood samples should not be combined with real estate files.  This was her job at the law office, to file these cases.  She got permission from her boss, Mr. Masry to further investigate this case.  This shows her intuition, which is effective decision making on her part to become an effective leader.  And in true life, with someone having only a high school education, shows that she has true determination to make a difference in the world. This movie is a must see!! 0.12229552469135803\n",

The supporting cast was also good; Marg Helgenberger, as one of the ailing residents, and Aaron Eckhart, who plays the biker who babysits Brockovich' kids.But Julia Roberts turns the film into damaged goods. Although the title character is not the brightest jane on the block, it seems anything Roberts plays is this arrogant, immature, obnoxious, loud bimbo.

Now, I'll be the first to admit I never thought much of her. Aside from pretty woman, I thought she was over rated, but here she shows me what she can do. I couldn't help but fall in love with the sassy, humorous, intelligent, powerful, determined, character she portrayed. I think she and Albert Finney (always amazing) lift the film to heights it would not have reached. Director Steven Soderbergh holds this movie together well, though at times it seems to be losing the narrative momentum. The screenplay is laced with wonderful dialogue and the relationships are well thought out.

      "[MILD SPOILER MAYBE]Big evil corporate America abuses little guy America.  What a novel concept, I hadn't heard that one before.  Perhaps we should plum this line of inquiry to see if there are other examples.  Once again Leftywood shows us just how lucky citizens of Mother Russia (until that stupid revolution), Red China, North Korea, Cuba, and other bastions of enlightenment really are.  There are no evil corporations or corrupt businessmen to harm anyone in those safe havens.  The fact their citizens risk limb and life to escape paradise and come to abusive America not withstanding.  If you read any defense of P.G.& E. and the corporate executives responsible for the portrayed acts and subsequent cover up in these remarks, don't.  Is it even necessary to say that these criminals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law?  No mercy.  No how. Well.then why.make such remarks? Would this be a sufficient reason?  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a silly and mindless one dimensional (poor people are good, rich people are bad) claptrap of a film that uses manipulative emotions, a rude and vulgar antihero, lies, and cleavage to tell it's tale.  The manipulative emotions are hardly worth exploring since they fairly drip off the screen in every scene.  It turns what could have been, no, should have been, drama into sap.  If our hero is not rude and vulgar then I'll just eat breakfast.  When you don't have much else going for you rude and vulgar is good cover.  Apparently kidnapped early in life by the CIA, or some other nefarious arm of American injustice, she was forced to marry a worthless man who beat her.  It gets worse.  After escaping this terrible fate (I think he left her) those same evil brutes tracked her down and make her do it again (Bastards!).  They also made her have three children, which she could not provide a proper home for.  Hey it wasn't her fault.  She was in no way responsible for her lot in life.  I'm even sorry I brought it up. Fortunately, she meets her prince charming (the slacker biker who doesn't work 'cause he don't by god have to) and he saves the day.  Well.for a while anyway until nature (the road) calls.  Before prince charming goes split-city we are treated to some tender moments of passion twix the two lovers.  One line I found particularly poignant, not to mention prophetic was ''Please, don't tell me that you are somebody I'm going to have to get over\".  Gag me with a spoon.  Did I mention the cleavage?  I like to think of it as the glue that holds the whole work together.  If God had created Woman with three breast instead of two this movie would not have been made for 200-300 years.

Don't give up without a good contestation. That being said, it is very admirable to see someone leading a hard knock life and realizing that there are people out there that have it much worse. Rather than in passing say that is sad, Brockovich set out to try to right a wrong that has been plaguing our entire country for decades.....destruction of our natural environment that brings on massive illness to a population.

      "There is no doubt that Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant and uplifting story; showing that what we (South) Africans call Ubuntu; caring for each other and assisting in anyway possible simply because we are all human and it is our fellow humans that make us who we are . I always liked Don Cheadle but his performance in Hotel Rwanda made it clear that he's one of the most underrated actors - The Brother is Brilliant! His performance in the movie is outstanding to say the least. He literally carries the movie on his shoulders. Sophie Okonedo (Cheadle's wife in the movie) gives a great performance. Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix are also brilliant. There some brilliant visual moment in the movie, for instance when the UN trucks are ambushed when trying to transport Tutsi refugees for the time and when the military rescues the trucks the second time the mission is taken. There are brilliant shots and brilliant acting.However, I have a couple of concerns (to put it mildly) Well, I appreciate that I do not know or understand the reasons for the director and producer's decision to do and use methods that I'm about to question. However, as junior director in SA who hopes to be able to tell African stories to the world at some point, I'm very concerned. Firstly, the story is based in Rwanda however, South Africans make up what appears at least 70% of the cast that has dialogue/lines in the movie. This is of course great for Our industry as Our actors are getting exposure and experience. The problem however, is that they have South African accents when they are supposed to be Rwandan; Fana Mokoena (although his performance was great,) only remembered to have an accent towards the end of the movie - same goes for Desmond Dube! Yes an accent might not be a big deal but language is an important issue; it helps the local audience identify with the characters and gives the characters a sense of originality. Yes, the international audience might not be as aware of the differences between a South African and a Rwandan accent but South Africans and Rwandan's know and I feel that it is not fair to them (Rwandans). I don't understand why they couldn't use Rwandan actors….There are one too many mistakes that again ruin the sense of originality, such as the use of English; it's used way too much! Yes this was made for an international audience but speaking from a Black South African's point of view whose first language is not English, there are times when you don't use it: when you've just been rescued from death by someone who understands your language, you'll thank them in that language! Especially with relatively old extras - I know for a fact that those in rural areas don't speak English to you if can understand their language they are more concerned about preserving languages that are being taken over by Western languagesWhat got me annoyed is that there's a scene featuring a red taxi in front of The Hotel and the taxi has a big yellow Alexandra (Johannesburg, SA) Taxi Association sticker on one of the windows - so what, do Rwandans have Alex taxis, we just didn't know about it?! What got me fuming are the names of the children displayed on boards at a refugee camp; Thabo, Buhle, etc. For crying out loud these are South African names! Again, someone from Canada might not know the difference but what does this imply to Rwandan's; that yes, this amazing story will be told but they'll be watered down as much as possible?!This annoys me because I believe that if one is to tell a story about a people, one has to do it right; in every sense of the word. What is the point of saying one is telling a South African Story then bring a whole American cast and props? I felt that I had to make an effort to convince myself that the story is based in Rwanda when watching the film because there are so many things that suggest otherwise. I guess this is another important sign (as in Amandla) that if we as Africans want our stories told and portrayed as real and true as possible, we have to do it ourselves.Having stated my concerns, I still say big ups to Terry George and the whole production team for telling this amazing story.

It makes the viewers question, \"Where were we about eleven years ago (I was about five or six years old) and why didn't we help?\" and \"How can people be so cruel?\" I can believe people are that cruel but at the same time I can't believe it. It is very touching and very moving and hopefully it will open eyes to the trouble around the world.

      "The movie was brilliant I had to see it for history class and I learned a lot. I wanted to see the movie Don Chedle is brilliant and is great at this particular role. His wife was great as well. This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war. The movie was so great but very sad I cried and I am writing an essay on the movie. I also want to see it again. It was so good and there is a lesson to be learned about helping and keeping peace between people. I felt very sorry for the people of Rwanda who lost family members. 0.2922619047619047\n",
      "This movie is an utter disgrace, falsely based on the antics of a supposedly ''hero'' of the Rwanda Genocide. As a film it does have a feel good thing going but as history it is a self serving, tissue of lies. In fact this Hutu ''hero'' was responsible for the death and blackmail of many Tutsis. He is now living in the US, a very rich man, making a fortune as a speaker by retelling these lies. If I could I would give this film no stars . 0.24791666666666665\n",
      "In 1994 tensions are high in Rwanda between the ruling Hutus and the Tutsis rebels while the UN tries to broken a peace agreement. This is of little interest to Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu with a Tutsis wife whose position within a leading hotel means he has to curry favour with many officials and smoothing over any potential problems at every turn. When the Hutu president is assassinated, a massacre of Tutsis begin  adults and children alike. With the UN unable to take action due to the indifference of the West the murders continue and Paul finds himself with a hotel, evacuated of important whites but full of Tutsis refugees as the Hutus seek to finish the job they started.I'm not entirely sure how one can review this film with a clear mind because no matter how good or bad a film it is, it is near impossible not to left shaken by the events it depicts. The plot follows the story of Paul Rusesabagina, who pulled all the strings he could to protect the Tutsis refugees who wound up in his hotel during the genocide by the Hutus. In this regard we are given a way into the atrocities through this specific story and this is both a strength and a weakness in the telling. The strength is that it gives us a focal point and a point of emotional connection that we can relate to and see a human face in the way that the terrifying numbers do not. However the downside of this is that it makes the story smaller than it could have been and puts the scale of atrocities outside of our direct view for the majority. It also means that it produces a \"happy\" ending that leaves you with a sense of some respite (not to mention the obligatory \"African\" song). This was a problem for me because the film had succeeded in gutting me at points and I didn't want to be left with any upbeat note  I wanted to go away feeling just like the foreign photographer did; \"f**king ashamed\".However considering what the film does well, it is petty and unfair to make a bit issue out of the fact that the narrative is occasionally a bit clunky and perhaps that the depiction of the genocide doesn't go far enough. Even without graphic violence and more than one scene of actual horror the film still sickened me to my stomach, had me almost shaking with anger and fear while at the same time failing to prevent tears rolling. Like many viewers I knew little more than a genocide occurred and couldn't have told you which side was killing the other  this is not ignorance on my behalf but just the fact that the West ignored this and stood by while it occurred while the media gave it little or no coverage. The film depicts this very well giving us enough horror and enough human emotion mixed with an understanding of the West's attitude to produce an impression of an event that is indefensible and truly, truly horrific. The characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough to give us an understanding of what occurred. While I do feel that the film could have shown more and been wider, the close focus on the hotel and the Rusesabagina's means that we are never far from understanding the true extent of horror and just how much of a reality death is  Paul does not discuss how his family will survive if the hotel is stormed, only how they will die in the least horrific way.Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.Overall this is not a perfect film; it didn't quite go far enough and the focus on a small group tended to conceal the scale of the genocide. However this is a minor complaint because the film is devastatingly effective and is impossible to watch without feeling lost, helpless and utterly ashamed for our inaction. This is not an easy watch and will not be a fun night out for the audience but for many reasons it deserves as large an audience as possible. 0.013000000000000003\n",

Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy.

      "I finally saw Hotel Rwanda and I thought it was good, not great, and not terrible. I agree that you didn't get the FULL horror of the genocide but I think there certainly was a sufficient amount of brutality to get what occurred across; scenes like the one on the foggy road were very disturbing.What annoyed me more than any problems I had with the movie was the level of pretension in some comments I read (this one not excluded). Where are the, \"the scene where Don Cheadle is shirtless was hot\" posts? Instead, I just see people writing \"I am better than everyone because I know what REALLY happened\" under the veil of a leading questions like, \"I liked the movie a lot BUT I would like people to share their thoughts on if the film's distortion of reality was justifiable in that it led to the ends of greater mass appeal?\" Hmmmm. 0.2653061224489796\n",

      "Hotel Rwanda has the merit of bringing to the western attention the amplitude and drama of the civil war in Rwanda between two local factions Hutu and Tutsi, a war that lead to almost 1 million victims, most of them non-militants, women and children. Don Cheadle portrays the real Paul Rusesabagina, the Hutu manager of the Belgium-owned hotel Mille Collines who, while trying to protect his own family (his wife being a Tutsi) from the irrational killing, ends up offering asylum and protection to about 1,000 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. Paul is an interesting character, a man who was cultivating his friendship with the powerful hotel guests, knowing that the time will come when he will require their favors. His virtual rope-walking is impressive and Cheadle's performance is up to par.However, the movie fails to deliver an informed unbiased view on the war in Rwanda, but rather chooses a heavy-handed approach which can be summarized as: Rwanda was artificially divided into Hutu/Tutsi's by the ruling European and now the Hutu want to exterminate the previously-ruling Tutsi's. The same European and UN do not care in the least about the genocide that is unfolding, and turn their backs after recovering their own citizens from the country. Furthermore, they probably supply weapons to the various factions. The Hutu's are exterminating villains, while the Tutsi rebels are the saviours. In truth, just to give one example, as the Tutsi rebels managed to overthrow the Hutu's and the Interahamwe militia, they drive approximately 2 million Hutu's into exile for fear of repercussions.Furthermore (some spoilers ahead) the movie itself falls into the typical handkerchief-drama stereotypes. There is an entire setup meant to lead us believe that Paul's family committed suicide as he instructed them at some point, in case they risk being captured. Did anyone fall for that? Or even if you did, wasn't it obvious from the moment Paul instructs his wife, that we will get to this point in the movie where he at least will believe they followed through? While the massacre is gruesomely portrayed, none of the characters that are introduced in the movie actually gets hurt. All the dead people are just nameless masses. The only named loss is that of Paul's brother in law, yet his two daughters are found against all odds allowing the movie to end with a high spirit-lifting tone as the main characters are happy embracing each other and singing...A missed opportunity. 0.02449999999999998\n",
      "This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's \"civil\" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about \"never letting it happen again,\" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago.

      "\"Hotel Rwanda\" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with \"Hotel Rwanda\", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out \"Sometimes in April\", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective.

      "''Hotel Rwanda'''is a very powerful and sad story showing the atrocities that happened in Rwanda in 1994,where almost 1 million people were killed in 100 days. The division of two groups, the tutsis and the hutus,made Rwanda's peace something to dream about. We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus. Even measuring the noses was a normal thing to do. Years after, the Hutus were the ones who stayed with the power and they wanted revenge by smashing the tutsis.This movie shows the history of a man called Paul Rusesabagina and his courage during the war in Rwanda, when he saved the lives of over a thousand helpless tutsi refugees from a big genocide. Paul is a hutu, but his family is tutsi, another reason to have experienced the terrible things the hutus were doing to the tutsis.Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are both awesome in their roles, and Don should have won the best actor award/Nobel.Ps: Jean Reno's cameo here. 0.23666666666666666\n",
      "It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, \"Shake Hands With The Devil.\") The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen.

      "This is a 'negative review', and I'm having a hard time explaining why I'm dissatisfied with this movie. I'll do my best. First off, it is a noble effort  the fact that this movie covers this topic of the Rwandan genocide, attempting to bring it a wide audience, is something to be commended. In the contemporary clutter of brainless, feel-good movies, anything that tries to be somewhat responsible and serious is to be commended for effort alone. But dealing with a topic of this magnitude is a double edged sword: the movie has a responsibility to making the viewer feel 1 million dead.Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies.When there are 1 million people being butchered, I don't want to see the main character hugging his wife, telling the audience how much his family means to him. I don't want to see the obviously sanitized gruesomeness that won't revolt the typical movie-goer. And please, I don't want to see the many, many cheap and improbable just-in-time rescues. Not here. That's too easy.I can see that in every other popcorn flick concerning concocted disasters befalling some typical hero. (This type of treatment has been cheapened by its predecessors, and it no longer genuinely reaches the audience - or at least this member of the audience.) Something truly original was needed here, a delicate mix between the irrationality and inhumanity of the conflict. Instead, it let just a little bit of Hollywood formula creep in, and for Rwanda, that is unacceptable. Despite its excellent attempt, the movie fails.Perhaps not surprisingly. This movie sets a huge expectation for itself by dealing with such a gruesome, REAL event. How do you condense into 2 hours something that no one can even begin to grasp, understand, explain? But the difficulty of its task still doesn't rescue this movie, because effort marks can only go so far. Even the slightest bit of over dramatization and the show cheapens  the lovely tale of the hotel manager falls apart, and the figure of 1 million dead reappears. It turns Hotel Rwanda from an attempt to make one understand and appreciate this bit of history",

      "A searing indictment of the West's complete refusal to do Anything 11 years ago. When the Rwandan massacres began, it was like a dam burst-the Hutu president's plane is shot down, and the violence tore across that country for 100 days. I remember the news--500,000, 800,000, maybe up to a million people were butchered. We did Nothing. White people from away got out, and that was all. I have always been a Clinton fan but that was his worst moment, being too scared of committing to another Somalia to do so much as send in a single GI.So here you have the Hotel, a four-star swanky oasis during the genocide's, w/ Don Cheadle bribing every general or bigwig Hutu in sight to stay alive, stay in business, and keep the huddled Tutsis inside alive for yet another day, a week, month, 'til freedom finally comes at the end. Cheadle is incredible in this. He deserved an Oscar.It's played very much as a Schindler's List goes Africa, from the point of view of the Hotel. You wind up only seeing the violence here, here, and there, whenever the sea of war hits the Hotel itself before moving on again.The most jarring scenes--the van load of Tutsi's surrounded by militia in the street, w/ a desperate Cheadle bribing them to their freedom, the 'bumpy road' which turns out to be acres of bodies lying hacked to death as far's the eye can see, and of course the separation from his wife. I found myself wincing especially in the 'bumpy road' section.

      "This review contains spoilers...Hollywoodization is a term used to describe the changing of factual events in order to make them more marketable to the masses, like changing the events, throwing in a love interest and always removing hard questions.In Hotel Rwanda's case, the hollywoodization occurred within this movie, when the theme of genocide was decided to be played down in order to appeal to a wider audience of moviegoers, this is ultimately the films demise.Don Cheadle gives an incredibly Oscar worthy performance in what would otherwise be a mediocre film that had the potential to be the next \"Schindlers List\" but failed. Cheadle plays a hotel manager and a good family man caught up in the events leading to and ultimately transpiring during the Rwandan genocide in 1993.The majority of the film takes place with Paul (Cheadle) and his family refugees inside the Hotel Paul is the manager of. The actual genocide that is the main plot device of the movie is given very brief screen time and the majority of the scenes dealing with it, is the aftermath of it.Joaquin Phoenix's character, a journalist does give us a quick look at a very distant and out of context shot of two Rwandan's murdering a young girl, but Joaquin Phoenix has very little screen time and as quickly as he came into the film, he is almost quicker out of it leaving Cheadle to occupy the screen on his own.However, Cheadle has his family with him, most notably his wife, Sophie Okonedo who is the epitome of the word \"melodrama\", her prescence is one of many anchors to the film and she could have done with much less screen time as she only brings Cheadle down in the scenes she shares with him. Her emotions jump backwards and forwards in all of her scenes, it's as if she suffers from Bipolar disorder, having just witnessed a massacre outside of the hotel she is outraged and crying, then seconds later is laughing and enjoying a drink with her husband who is trying to romance her, talk about inappropriate, it's as if there is no genocide occurring outside of the Hotel, and for all the film portrays, there is not.The next biggest flaw with the film was the decision to cast Nick Nolte, who is in my opinion a good actor, as long as he is playing himself (such as he was in Affliction), but this time he isn't playing himself, he is playing a composite of General Romeo Dallaire named Colonel Oliver, who has NONE of Dallaire's qualities as a human being. Nolte drags on with his dialogue and it is my opinion that he was most likely intoxicated while filming took place, he looks confused, tired and hung over the entire film, not exactly military material. He bumbles, is incompetent and gets drunk on duty, is this the film makers idea to make Cheadle a more effective hero? By disqualifying everyone else of the role? In 1993, 800,000 souls were murdered and millions of others died as refugees and instead of showing this and letting the world know, we see Paul and his wife enjoying cocktails with Colonel Oliver, while their countrymen are being murdered just outside their doors.A mediocre film that suffered from hollywoodization, for an actually emotional film that deals with the tragedies in Rwanda, I would suggest seeing \"Shake Hands With the Devil\", a film that does not suffer from hollywoodization and will leave you questioning humanity.Cheadle was good, the rest of the movie was not.6/10 0.055776289682539684\n",

Paul saw his responsibility to save as many people as he could, the majority being Tutsis, by sheltering them in his hotel, and bribing (with money and alcohol) police for protection.

      "After watching this movie last night in the privacy of my own home, I was left sorry and embarrassed. Embarrassed by the fact that in 1994 I was well old enough to have paid more attention to events going on in the world around me. I keep hearing the comment uttered by (Joaquin Phoenix's character)as they were leaving...I'm so ashamed! I had no idea! I am so glad I saw this movie so that now I personally can be more aware of similar tragedies going on in the world around me today!

      "Hotel Rwanda is an interesting movie to say the least. The plot revolves around the civil war between the Tutsis and the Hutus. The main character of the film named Paul has to protect the refugees of the war in the hotel he manages. I personally liked the character development with the U. N general. He first didn't see Paul as equal to him,but then near the end saw him like a being and saved him and the refugees. I personally did not understand the conflict between Hutus and the Tutsis. Was it like the tutsis being inferior to them or another aspect. I liked the ending where they find the nieces of Paul and his wife. 0.19666666666666668\n",
      "Wow. Do you want to go to a movie theatre and cry like a little baby? Well, then you should have gone to see Hotel Rwanda when it was still in theatres. Now, you'll just have to Kleenex it by yourself at home. I really wasn't expecting to cry at this movie because I hardly ever do cry at movies, but this was a completely emotionally draining experience. There are some instances (when Paul Rusesabagina rips off his shirt after riding over a sea of dead bodies in the hotel van, for example) that, while they may well have happened in real life, come off as cheesy and over-dramatic. All in all, though, it is supremely acted, well-cast, and disturbingly beautiful. I had the extreme pleasure of going to hear Paul Rusesabagina speak when he came to Eckerd College. He's a very nice man, and a good representation of humanity. 0.12715277777777778\n",
      "I was conflicted for about two seconds before deciding to give a film like this a bad review, a film that I really am a minority in since it was widely praised and reached by some miraculous flight to number 62 in the IMDb top 250. It's just a shameless and grueling piece of film-making, and I can't help but feel disgusted that the Rwandan genocide has been reduced and distilled by Hollywood into this.The injustice is overbearing. As someone who was in lower Manhattan on 9/11, I resented Oliver Stone for making his swan song 'World Trade Center', another hand wringing piece of garbage that was so disconnected from the reality of the event it was laughable, which is terrible because the last thing you want is to see such an inaccurate reflection of events to where you are forced by the director to sneer and feel uncomfortable at a film about it. Believe me, people, there were no violins playing in Rwanda while this was going on. I appreciate how people are waking up to genocide and injustice in Africa and how Don Cheadle has taken his research from this film and gone on to bring tremendous public awareness to places like Sudan, but that is all I can give this.For one, it does nothing to speak of the actual problems that led to the genocide in the first place, leaving an audience that might not know about the lead up to this story (and I do think the target audience for this film has no idea where Rwanda is on a map) to come to the conclusion that there is such thing as 'faceless evil', as arbitrary as some of the worst crimes humanity has ever encountered are, things aren't this simple, black-white, right-wrong. I think this kind of mentality has led the way for Bush's statements on 'good and evil' and 'evildoers' to be taken at face value, without questioning the social, political, religious, or moral conflicts that might have led to an act of genocide like this, or an act like September 11. I suggest instead of watching this film and thinking you have learned something about history, you pick up a book like 'The Graves are Not Yet Full' to understand the complex dynamics in Africa, dynamics that have led to generations being wiped out by ethnic cleansing and tribal conflict. I worry that a film like this closes out on a still ongoing argument, leaving the viewer with a feeling that even in the face of humanity's most vile action, 'everything will be okay' with people like Paul Rusesabagina around. This simply is not true.This film made me viscerally angry. This wasn't simply a 'bad movie', I feel like it stepped over a personal boundary, my own human boundary and insulted me, and literally millions of other people that have to endure life's struggle as it's given to them. I watch this and I feel ashamed to only have to endure the hour and a half of this film, and that is the stark low point of my day. I feel ashamed to even afford a ticket to waste on this movie. It's watered down, inaccurate film-making at it's most manipulative point, and that is what makes me angry, not to mention Don Cheadle's embarrassing attempt to 'be African' while driving in carefully placed advertisements for Volkswagon. Really he is a just sheltered like the rest of us, a Hollywood movie star sucking in fat paychecks while there is real, not dramatized, suffering in the world just adds to the pain of watching the film. I saw 'Sometimes in April' recently and found this to be much more believable and affecting a film, I would recommend this well above 'Hotel Rwanda'. The realities are still out there, this is fantasy. I know this is harsh, but this film insults my intelligence as a film-goer and as a human being. -0.06690613026819926\n",
      "10/10 Best way to describe this movie is a cross between Schindler's List and The Pianist - two of the most powerful films I've ever seen. While Paul's (Don Cheadle) situation continues to get worse as the movie progresses just like Adrien Brody, he does whatever he can to help the Tutsi and Hutu refugees at his hotel. Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine. I would give Cheadle the nod for Best Actor, and the movie is a must-see for people of all backgrounds. An amazing film. 0.24434523809523806\n",
      "This film is a documentary of man's inhumanity to man and is a very disturbing film. Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda. Go see this one you will be richly rewarded. 0.28215277777777775\n",

This movie has opened my eyes so much. I have only heard of the genocide on the news briefly, but this movie has made me more aware and I think it will make anyone who watches it more aware of what is going on over there.

This is one movie that Hollywood and the filmmakers of the world do deserve applause for, the main character, who is a real person- Paul Rusesabagina, who is a real world who is hero without weapons. The movie also did a good job in showing the plight of the UN Soldiers, who are often painted as unfeeling robots when in fact they do very much care about the refugees they are trying to protect and save.

Don Cheadle didn't win Academy Award for Best Actor because Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles was perfect!There are a lot of things that I can say, but still everyone has his own opinion, I agree with that, but those who put this film 4 or less, your opinion is stupid!So all haters and envious persons take your hands off of the film!!! 0.1202799479166667\n",
      "I just saw Hotel Rwanda on PBS, and after reading other reviews here, I must admit I felt let down. It was admittedly well made, but didn't leave any lasting impression. Probably because it was basically an excellent solo show by Don Cheadle. Sophie Okonedo was badly miscast; whoever saw a Tutsi that light-complexioned? Nick Nolte just wasn't believable as a General. Some may criticise me for being too bloodthirsty, but apart from the episode when Cheadle was driving over the bodies in the road, the depiction of the treatment of Tutsi was too long-range and detached. It seemed like a news report viewed from a distance, without any real involvement. This is the story of an horrific episode, but fails to press its point. -0.11186868686868685\n",
      "I can't even understand how this movie was not nominated for best picture in this year's Oscars. I can't say for sure until I see The Aviator, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance better be SPECTACULAR to have beaten Don Cheadle for the Golden Globe (drama). I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day. But as they say in the movie, people will see pictures of the genocide, say, \"how horrible\", and go back to eating dinner.... I recommend all people go see this movie! 0.1806926406926407\n",

You don't seat in a terrace having a romantic dinner with your wife while listening to rocket and gun shots half a mile away. That's confusing for the public but I guess that's how Hollywood works. They don't care to explain the story and tell that to the world as closer as they can. They are like UN in this movie: they just don't care about Rwandan people.I hadn't seen this movie before but I was told it would be good because I just saw \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" which is a new movie about the Serbian genocide in Srebenica (Bosnie).

      "This movie deserves every accolade thrown its way. Don Cheadle probably has never been better. Based on an event that seemed to escape the eyes of the rest of the world. Some of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century was like a rancid belch in the central African nation of Rwanda. In spite of peace talks between the Hutus and Tutsis; the Hutus militia broke the pact and started killing Tutsis on sight. Almost one million people were brutally murdered in their homes, in the street at will. In the middle of the madness, an ordinary hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina(Cheadle)summoned the courage to actually save 1,268 refugees by hiding them in the four star hotel he managed. HOTEL RWANDA is a testament to Paul's devotion and love for his family and mankind. Also in this modern day classic: Mosa Kaiser, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Fana Mokoena, Mabutho 'Kid' Sithole, Kgomotso Seitshohlo, Simo Mogwaza and Hakeem Kae-Kazim.

      "Some people say that this is like the African version of \"Schindler's List\" now I wouldn't go that far, but it still is a fantastic and powerful film. The movie is basically about the Rwandan Genocide that took place in 1994, where many Tutsi are killed by the Hutu extremists. Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once. If I can name one flaws is that you don't really care about the people that are trying to survive from the genocide, but maybe that is just the realistic aspect of it and why the message behind this film is deep.7.9/10 0.20795454545454548\n",

      "This is an excellent film, about a real, live hero. It could have gone over the edge into a really bad snuff movie - but it balances out the history with the story, so that you look away, but you look back.The Joachim Phoenix character - the journalist - pretty much epitomises the 'western' journey through the story - from 'so what is the story, anyways?' to 'how the hell did *I* end up *here*' to 'okay - so why has this never happened to my family? and how do I guarantee it won't?'And there are no easy answers. Not one.The saddest thing about this movie? I've read one review, by someone I respected right up until that moment, saying - and this is a paraphrase - 'well, but it's not like the holocaust happened again, because, you know, 'never again' meant 'worthwhile people', and didn't refer, in any way, to, well... Africans'.And this was someone who'd watched the film, and really believed they respected the message behind it - but, hey, Schindler's list had all of that, *and* like, a *white* star...Okay - so maybe that's not the saddest thing about the whole film, but it sure made me cry.Came as a huge shock to me, I have to say... 0.18272456709956714\n",
      "*NOTE: I will point out all points where spoilers occur, so those of you who wish to avoid them can still get a critical opinion of the film from me, but I apparently must mark the review as containing spoilers, so I want to let everyone know that much of the review will still not contain spoilers*The most noticeably excellent part of \"Hotel Rwanda\" is the performance of Don Cheadle, who gives a wonderfully subtle and complete performance. Cheadle is able to let us know much about Paul Rusesabagina that would be easy to skip through brilliant small gestures. (*SPOILER* Notice the way he discerningly watches the military men in the hotel before the genocide begins--we see what a calculating, thoughtful man Rusesabagina is before we have much of anything that can tell us anything about him. *SPOILER OVER*) Sophie Okendo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix also give wonderful supporting performances (especially a surprising Nolte), but none is given a significant amount of time to breathe, because the film is about Paul and it is VERY focused.Many have said that the violence in this film is too little and thus distances us from the genocide, but there are reasons for this. First of all, the film is not really about the genocide--it's about Paul Rusesabagina, and it's focused on him nearly every second. Paul *SPOILER* only sees it when he and Gregoire are out running over bodies *SPOILER OVER*, and thus it cannot keep its focus on him without losing some violence. It also makes a point that the violence is too much for people--*SPOILER* Paul himself, Jack, and Roger are all rendered essentially mute when they see it: Paul has his emotional breakdown immediately after, Jack is silent while setting up his tape, and Roger is reduced to hiding scared silently, not even capable of telling his parents that it's not his blood *SPOILER OVER*. If the violence is too much for people to see, obviously we can't see much of it. It also makes the little pieces of violence we do see that much stronger that they are isolated.The dialog is very real and yet intelligent and the direction quiet, not trying to force too much on the viewer. The film is also quite heavily without score, lending even more weight and realism to the events depicted. The wonderfully focused script keeps us identifying with and watching Paul throughout the story, keeping him in constant, very real danger. The film even manages to get the story of how the Hutus and Tutsis emerged into it without seeming terribly forced, by bringing in a news team (including Joaquin Phoenix, who is rather quietly building up a very impressive body of work) to cover the events.All told, \"Hotel Rwanda\" is a great film depicting a truly remarkable story of a man doing wonderful things in an almost unbelievably terrible situation. The acting is top-notch, the writing is superb, the direction is as good as one can hope for, and the story has a powerful resonance to the point that it makes one think again about what nations' obligations to the people of another nation are. In an excellent year in film (three films that I would rank in probably the top 25 I've ever seen came out in 2004), \"Hotel Rwanda\" is one of the standouts and definitely the most powerful film to come out in a long time.

After I watched the film, I was pleased with what I saw. Don Cheadle played a wonderful performance as Paul Rusesabagina which earned Cheadle an Oscar nomination. The whole film actually reminded me of Schindler's List. The film is almost an identical twin of Schindler's List. Paul Rusesabagina is an Oskar Schindler type person. There the same people. The only thing different them is that there from different countries and are a different race. That's it. Overall, I liked Hotel Rwanda and I wasn't disappointed with the movie at all.

I felt guilty the whole time I was watching it, because I didn't \"feel\" anything. In fact I found it to be a pretty boring/sterile film save for the moment in the middle where the hotel owner walks in the foggy cloud among dead bodies. I can't believe that this was supposed to be about the real, devastating events that actually happened in Rwanda. I bet most of people who gave this movie rave reviews are just compensating for their previous ignorance and apathy. It's a mediocre, shallow movie parading itself as a powerful film about the great feat of a man standing up for humanity and protecting refugees during a time of ethnic genocide.

This is another recent release and though I believe there is no distributor yet for the US, you should try to see it if you can. I left the theatre feeling many of the same things I felt when I saw Hotel Rwanda, but I was more sympathetic towards Voces because it portrayed war through the eyes of an innocent boy like I had never seen done before.

      "Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful. 0.32557142857142857\n",
      "Read complete Review athttp://screenart.blogspot.com'Hotel Rwanda' is the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a good, simple and a decent man. What's extraordinary about him is that he remains a good man, a simple man and a decent man when somebody points a gun at him. That takes extraordinary courage. It's not the sort of courage where he plots and fights to kill the bad guys, but a Gandhian courage where his actions bear his goodness signature and are devoid of any violence. Paul is the manager of the Milles Collines Hotel, Kigali, Rwanda. He belongs to the Hutu tribe, which has just come to the power (in 1994, when the movie begins) and a radio broadcast addresses the other tribe, Tutsi, as cockroaches.Because Paul is the manager of a star hotel, he has contacts with many high level officials and because of his human nature, he is in their good books. When the Hutus took the government office, there was a mild trepidation among the Tutsis and when the Hutu president was killed by the Tutsi rebels, the trepidation transformed into a strong fear. Paul takes his family (his wife is a Tutsi) and his Tutsi neighbours to his hotel. Good hearted Red Cross workers save as many victims as possible and they bring them to Paul, because he is the only one they know who can't say 'no.' Paul keeps the wagon spinning by bribing the soldiers with wine and money, but that doesn't help him after a while. What unfolds is a chronicle of Paul's desperate measures to keep the soldiers at bay and save as many as possible.There is a scene about halfway into the movie. Paul gets rice, beans and milk powder from black market and returns to his hotel on a very foggy morning. Suddenly they seem to have hit a bumpy road and the van is stopped. Paul gets out to check whats up with the road. He stumbles, falls down and slowly, shiveringly gets back to his feet realizing that the whole street is full of fresh corpses. Along with Paul, I too lost my balance, and gained my hold on conscience slowly. They were all hacked to death with machetes and gardening instruments. And it was just one of many such streets all over the country.The above scene is an example of powerful film-making. The movie is rated PG-13. There is no explicit violence. But we are allowed to understand the immensity of the genocide through such scenes, where we only get a glimpse, because it's hazy and unclear because of the time of the day and still we realize the cruelty of the massacre. There is another scene where Paul is unsure whether his family is dead or alive and he runs across the hotel rooms looking for them. The character development is so complete that I too was running with Paul desperately looking for his family. And when he finds his wife and kids hiding in a bathroom tub, they all cry and laugh and then I slowly settled comfortably into my seat with a happy smile knowing that his family is safe.Don Cheadle as Paul delivers a stellar performance. The beauty of his act lies in his simplicity. There is not a scene where he overacts or underacts. Sophie Okenado as Paul's wife Tatiana is equally admirable. There are so many close up shots of these two artistes and there is not a single wrong twist on their faces... every emotion they express is accepted without a question. The supporting cast, which comprises of Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Desmond Dube... are all top notch. Terry George is the director working on a script by himself and Keir Pearson. I was simply immersed into the story and that pretty much sums the quality of work by the writer/director. Music should have been good because it never drew attention to itself.Paul saved over twelve hundred lives during a three month hell where close a million people were killed. The UN didn't intervene because what happened in Rwanda couldn't be termed 'genocide' and if this isn't genocide, I don't know what it is. That reminds me of another recent sad story - Darfur, Sudan. Again, the first world countries and the UN turned a blind eye as trained militia went of a life-hungry rampage. I've read cover stories about the active role played by USA and UN in African countries - it's really uplifting. During the Rwandan genocide, a Pentagon bastard joked \"Is it Hutu or Tutu?\" I know that if something goes wrong in Nigeria, high level meetings will actively take place because it's the eighth largest exporter of oil. So much for world peace!! This cinema is about respecting another human being. This cinema is a showcase of the horror due to the unnecessarily deep-rooted distinctions based on caste, race, tribe, etc. This cinema is an attempt to shame the U.N and the first world countries for their callousness. This cinema is a reminder of the value of life. From an artistic viewpoint, this is a very good cinema. From a historic viewpoint, this is an important cinema. 'Hotel Rwanda' must be shown in the UN general assembly for a packed audience who call themselves diplomats. If this doesn't put them to shame, I don't know what will. 0.10701577853363567\n"

      "I thought it was very interesting to learn about the genocide. I knew very little about the Rwandan Genocide before I watched the movie. I can't believe there was nobody to protect the people in the hotel. Paul was my favorite character because he never gave up on his guests. He loved his family and just wanted to make them safe, but he was also willing to stay behind and help the people who stayed in the hotel. Paul was genuinely my favorite character I've watched in any movie this year. He was very brave and never thought about just saving himself. Moreover, it was crazy to think that nobody in American politics wanted to help. I think they definitely knew what was going on over there. America intervenes in so many conflicts it just doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't help. I was curious as to why people in America didn't help, so I decided to do some research. Not only did America abandon the Rwandan people but also other major powers, like France. When the killing in Rwanda intensified the major powers pulled out. The French set up a \"humanitarian zone\" which is where I guess the people from the hotel ended up in the end of the movie. I guess that was helpful but nobody wanted to go beyond and reach out to pull innocent people into the safe zone. Also, I found an article that said Bill Clinton knew about the mass killing of people in Rwanda but buried the evidence so America wouldn't intervene. The officers who were on the ground in Rwanda used the word Genocide when they described the situation; however, because Bill Clinton had already decided not to intervene the press never got coverage of the killings as a genocide. 0.2026785714285714\n",
      "Quite simply a brilliant movie. It has a great balance between style and theme. It is refined, artly, but at the same time it has that rare quality of a work of art that talks about something essential. It is simply a must-see movie, a lesson for all other movie-makers that thought that a horror-reality is enough to provide a quality end-product. Extremely well-played and directed, this is a movie that goes far beyond its context and will perhaps become a point of reference for several reasons at least: its treatment of image, pictural and subtle; the screenplay, concise and balanced, the whole product which offers the impression of something complete to which you cannot add or take anything from. 0.10098039215686276\n",
      "I went into this film thinking oh gosh i don't want to see a boring film about death and poverty and small cute children dying. I came out of this film thinking wow, what a sick cruel world we live in. It really made me think. At first i thought it was going to be like The Constant Gardner and be a complete bore, but i was so surprised at how well made and gripping it was. Although The Constant Gardner may have mystery, Hotel Rwanda has tension, which ultimately wins the movie over for me. Hotel Rwanda tells the story of the Genocide in Rwanda, Africa and how it affects a hotel manager and his family. The cast are great, especially Don and Spohie who give fantastic emotion and love as the husband and wife who come from different tribes. Not only does Hotel Rwanda give you information about the real story of the Tootsies and the Hotu's, but it gives us a story to follow and characters to follow and feel for. Although it may not look brutal as in violence, the fact that something like over 8 million people died is quite sickening, and the fact that no one did anything is even more sickening. I loved this movie and although its not a oh lets all sit down and be happy movie, it still has comedy moments and tender moments. One of the best films this year! 0.043050745550745555\n",
      "1.Hotel Rwanda (2004) is truly an \"African Schindler's List\" filmed in the back drop of 1994 civil war between Hutu and Tulsi tribes of Rwanda, killing 1 million people in 3 months.Lead Character is a manager at hotel who saves lives of about 1000 Tulsi children,men and women by using his links with UN and Rebel's General...Its a true story and quite moving one. The real Rwandan couple lives in Belgium now.2.Parallel Linkages: The movie has two parallel linkages:-a. It is linked thematically to mainstream cinema movies which are on the specific themes of politico/military conflicts......where UN peace keeping forces were employed to restore peace. Other movies include Beyond No borders (Bosnia, Cambodia etc issue),Black Hawk Down(Pakistani/UN forces operating in Somalia) and Blood Diamond(Sierra Leon).b. Also there are few \"conflict\" based movies in which the main characters use their influence and a \"place\" (factory/school/hotel) to help and save the lives of helpless people trapped in conflict. Three movies are particularly notable and Hotel Rwanda is one of them.Firstly,In \"Schindler's List (1993)\", lead character Oskar Schindler uses his \"factory\" during WW-II to save Jews from becoming victims of Holocaust.In \"Hotel Rwanda\"(2004) ; lead character Paul Rusesabagina uses his \"hotel\" to save lives of children and people of Tulsi tribe from atrocities of Hutu tribe.In \"Miral\"(2010) ; lead character Hind Husseini, a lady operating a school Dar Al-Tifel in Palestine uses her \"school\" to protect and educate Palestinian orphan children.All the above three movies are based on \"real life characters\".3.

An outstanding performance by Don Cheadle playing a Rwandese international hotel manager, who bought into the story that the UN would not abandon them. As Cheadle comes to understand that he was duped by the rhetoric Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a reporter assigned to cover Rwanda, suggests that the most likely reaction of the western world after watching the horrible footage on the news would be: \"They will say how horrible, and will go on eating their dinner.\" The lack of an international intervention force, in a situation when it was truly needed, is one of the main points of this movie.

      "Hotel Rwanda engages the viewer in a catastrophe of epic proportions while emphasizing the resilience of human dignity and the tenacity of love. Don Cheadle excels as Paul Rusesabagina, highest-ranking African official at a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Rwanda, who is left to run the place himself when European staff are recalled amid growing social violence. Paul's first concerns are to protect his family and to maintain a high level of service in the hotel. As the killing frenzy grows around him, so do his compassion and pragmatism, and he gradually opens his heart and the hotel's doors, converting luxurious quarters into a refugee camp. Nothing is overdone, and there is no preaching. But as the chaos spreads, turning neighbor against neighbor, the movie develops moral and artistic power. Private scenes are beautiful and convincing. Crowd scenes are authentic and riveting. Early on, as approaching guns explode and children huddle in fear, a small boy flinches in the crowd. You flinch with him. That's it. You're there.

      "2004, at least late 2004, may turn out to be the greatest period of cinema in the last 20 years at least. With the brilliance of such films as Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland and this heavy hitter but sadly under rated Hotel Rwanda. How does a film like this not get nominated for Best Picture by the Academy? Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina during the most turbulent time of Rwandan history. The two warring factions the Hutu's and the Tutsis are almost reaching a peace agreement when the Rwandan Presient is assassinated. Paul is big time businessman who spends his time making top connections in the event he needs to call in favors during war time. When war breaks out, Paul finds himself involuntarily harboring refugees in his hotel. As he is gradually immersed in horrifying images and war crimes against his own people, he stands strong and helps over 1200 refugees and saves their lives.Don Cheadle is amazing, he's always been a talented actor but Hotel Rwanda will launch his leading acting career. His leadership qualities and his role is amazing. I must admit, I find the supporting cast, including his wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, brief appearance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the hotel staff are certainly adequate but no one particularly stand out especially against Don Cheadle's role. But the cast really isn't what makes this movie a true astonishing film. It's the writing and the film making and the story, combined with Don Cheadle's role. Terry George focus's on the true horror of the Genocide situation, and Paul's struggle to save his own family but not at the cost of everyone else. He is determined to not let anyone die. The scenes of the bodies are disturbing and will bring tears to your eyes, and you feel Paul's compassion for this people. This might not be a well remembered event but after experiencing Hotel Rwanda, you won't ever forget it.

All that slaughter deserves a bit more than just calling the opposing tribes \"cockroaches.\" At first, I thought of Cheadle as miscast for the role - too stoic and businesslike to be a savior, but he did grow on me a bit as the film ran on. By the end, I actually believed him. (Unlike Nick Nolte, who was miscast for his role. Oh admit it, he's miscast for every role he's ever had -- he just can't act.)

No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story.

      "Terry George deserves much praise for being able to make this movie about a difficult time in the recent history of the world. Prior to seeing this movie I knew very little about the conflict that took place in Rwanda, and thus I am glad to have seen this movie to learn about the horrors that took place there in 1994. However, as a film itself, I believe Hotel Rwanda is very flawed. Everything in the film is milked hard for melodrama, which may be understandable given the subject matter. Nevertheless, I found the handling of this instance in time to be largely heavy-handed. Also, the characterization of many people in this movie felt very black-and-white, such as how the Tutsi Rebels were given somewhat of a hero treatment towards the end, despite the fact it was they who assassinated the President (though maybe it was not the rebels, the movie doesn't make this clear). Additionally, it states at the film's conclusion that the Hutu Army eventually fled to Congo as a happy-ending coda. But what went on in Congo after that? More chaos. The film fails to mention that many of the problems in Rwanda continue to exist in the African continent. Hopefully this will change, though whether it will in my lifetime appears debatable.On a more positive note, I do think the performances were very good, with Don Cheadle giving a very compassionate portrayal of the beleaguered hotel employee who strived to keep those around him safe. 0.11597900432900433\n",

      "Hotel Rwanda did not live up to my expectations. It was a decent movie, but it just isn't in the same category as Schindler's List.On the plus side, I thought that Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast did a fine job (although Nick Nolte was probably too old for the role that he played). I also thought that the movie depicted the Interahamwe militia in a chilling fashion. The most horrifying parts of the movie for me were the moments showing ordinary Rwandan Hutus being incited to kill the Tutsi \"cockroaches\" by Radio Mille Collines.On the negative side, I thought the movie \"disneyfied\" what happened in Rwanda. What happened in that country for 100 days was surreal. Hundreds of thousands of innocent Tutsi, Twa, and moderate Hutus were brutally murdered. Friends and neighbors killed each other. Doctors killed patients. Patients killed doctors. Teachers killed students. Students killed teachers. And supposed \"men of God\" betrayed their parishioners.Yet Hotel Rwanda shied away from depicting any of this. There was no scene like that in Schindler's List when the Nazis cleared out the Cracow Ghetto. We see the threat of violence, and we see the aftermath of violence. But we don't see the actual evil being committed. I think that one brief series of scenes depicting a massacre would have brought home the horror of Rwanda much more effectively than this movie did. Depicted (or non-depicted) as it is Hotel Rwanda, someone might think that there was some nameless force at work at Rwanda causing some people to act in a threatening fashion and randomly slaying others.My second criticism is the blame shifting that the movie did. It has become popular to blame the West, specifically the United States, France, and a few other countries, for what happened in Rwanda. The logic is that we knew what was happening was genocide, yet we did nothing to stop it.I was in the American Army at the time. Yet because I was over in the former Yugoslavia (where bad things were happening at a somewhat more leisurely pace), I was only dimly aware of what was going on in Africa. With ten years' perspective, I find myself wishing that we had intervened. Even a gesture as small as jamming \"Radio Genocide\" would have been something.Yet I totally reject that my country is at fault for Rwanda. The bottom line is this: the Hutus and Tutsis did it to themselves. I am including the Tutsis in the blame game because the Tutsi regime in Burundi committed enormous crimes against the Hutus living there before the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Those killings had dire consequences for the Tutsis in Rwanda.Assigning primary blame to people other than those who gave the orders to kill or were actually swinging the machetes is wrong for two reasons. First, it infantilizes the Hutus and Tutsis. They are human beings and have free will. Some of them did the right thing. Many more did not.Second, who can really say that the UN, US, or any other country could have stopped what happened? I would be willing to bet had there been an intervention by US military forces, some of the people here and elsewhere who are loudly damning the US for inaction would be just as loudly damning the US for \"violating Rwanda's sovereignty.\" Meanwhile people like John Pilger would be writing editorials accusing the US of trying to re-colonize Central Africa.I feel no guilt about Rwanda. Yet I wish that we had intervened anyway because it would have saved lives. That would have been worth having to put up with anti-war demonstrations and idiotic statements like \"this war is all about Congo diamonds, or uranium, or control of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest gorilla safari industry.\" -0.025259030586899437\n",

What HOTEL RWANDA attempts, and succeeds in doing, is bringing forth the absolute tragedy of a country driven to the extremes of decimating its own population in lieu of establishing the eventual dominance of the Hutus over the more \"esthetically pure and therefore privileged\" Tsutsis.However, where the movie really makes its mark is when Paul Russebagina, the smooth talking, subtle Hutu man who as of now has been able to get people to eat out of his palms faces the stomach-turning horror: no one will come to his aid, no one will even attempt to intervene to stop the madness that is exploding all around him. The U. N. has turned its eye away from the situation. Belgian soldiers within the country are escorting only foreign citizens. Paul and those left behind will have to fend for themselves and hope to find a way out.HOTEL RWANDA establishes the character of Russebagina as an essentially good person who gets caught in a situation that spirals out of control and forces him to face it head on: much like Clive Owen's character in CHILDREN OF MEN, or even Schindler in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his is a man who grows from being just an observer of sorts into a hero who goes beyond the call of duty while maintaining a brave face in the light of the sight of his people being massacred for the sake of genocide. Sophie Okonedo lends a strong support as Tatyana Russebagina, a role that could have been thankless but achieves a relevance all its own. Where Terry George's film succeeds is bringing a moral consciousness unto us, the people viewing this film which is a mirror of the events from over a decade ago without exaggerating the gore. It makes us aware that regardless of how distant these events might be unfolding, it's really unto us to lend a hand to those in need. 0.2181601731601732\n",
      "With reviews hailing this title as an African \"Schindler's List\", i gave this movie a go, expecting it to be very good.It was good, but not very good, and not excellent. Perhaps it was too hard comparing a movie like this to Schindler's List. Either way, do not get me wrong. It is still a compelling tale as one man struggles to save some 1300 refugees during the Rwandan genocide. I was impressed with Don Cheadle's portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, which demonstrated his versatility of an actor, having recently seen him in movies such as Crash and Traffic.

The story of one, brave man, that saved hundreds of people is really strong and breathtaking. All the actors are pretty good in it. And well done screenplay. Unfortunately, the film itself was hard to watch for me, because the music is just terrible (MIDI keyboard orchestrations and irritating melodic motives), the work of camera and generally visual work is boring and amateurish. If they gave such strong story based on such dramatic political situation to better director and crew, they could have made second \"Schindler's List\" out of it.

I liked how at the end of the movie when Paul is looking for Tatiana, it gives us false feelings that her and the children have jumped when in reality they are perfectly fine.

      "I have seen the movie and being a undergrad who has spent a year working on the Rwandan Genocide I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. I like that it is trying to bring some light on a subject that we have all seemed to forgotten or never really knew anything about in the first place. However, this movie never seemed to show the brutality or show the reality of the horrors that were occurring in this county at the time. Most of this film takes place in this hotel where they are drinking wine and one of their biggest problems is having to boil their drinking water out of the hotel's swimming pool. There are very few scenes where you are given the opportunity to see a glimpse of what the real horror of the genocide must have been like. I understand that the movie was trying to keep its PG 13 rating but I think that the rating of this film is not as important as the message. All that said this was a still a good movie and did a much better job with the historical facts then I had expected. 0.10523809523809524\n",
      "Having heard excellent things about this film I finally had the opportunity last night to see it before it left the cinemas here. I thought it was fantastic, extremely moving and well made. Don Cheadle excels in the lead role. The pacing and tension in the film is fantastic as Cheadle gradually takes on the role of protector for the Tutsi refugees, pleading and bargaining for their safety through his various connections forged as the manager of the luxurious Milles Des Collines hotel. His torn allegiance between his immediate family and the refugees he houses is at times both difficult and fascinating to watch. The ambush by Hutu rebels on the UN convoy with Cheadle's family on board is simply heart-stopping film at it's very best. Also the river road and Joaquin Phoenix's shame at being escorted to safety by the man with the umbrella are two of many unforgettable moments. The film opened my eyes to a wider world and I now feel ashamed of my relative ignorance and, more importantly, indifference to world events. It's true that I alone cannot make a difference but if more people are aware of incidents such as the one depicted to such breathtaking effect in this film then maybe in future people won't be left behind. Whoever, if anyone, reads this post, please either go or urge people to go and see this film.

Pheonix and Cheadle's conversation in the hotel quickly and simply explain the history without boring the audience.

      "Hotel Rwanda is a an amazing movie and a story that needs to be told. The Rwandan genocide, lasting just a few months, was one of the greatest tragedies among many in the twentieth century. The US, Europe and the UN stood by and watched and this leaves us lessons for current conflicts in Sudan and other parts of Africa. As a movie, Hotel Rwanda is wonderful. Don Cheadle is perfect as Paul, tough and determined but full of doubt and fear. Any of us could be Paul but few would have the guts and strength. Some reviewers have claimed the movie is too Hollywood or does not show the true violence, but the use of sound, facial emotions and scenery forces the viewer to put themselves in the place of a Rwandan, not an American viewer. The movie is almost a documentary of what happened but is also very moving and an appropriate length. All in our theater were choked up with emotion at the end. I spent time in Tanzania in 2003, next door to Rwanda. East Africa is still dealing with the repercussions of the Rwandan genocide and so should the world.

The story is easy to follow everything is understandable and Its a good historical movie that accurately shows what happened during the mass genocide of the Tutsi people.

Also Sophie Okonado appeared in this film who is also famous for appearing in 'Skin'. The whole film was made very emotional by the horrific and happy scenes.The film made me think about what people will do to save people's lives.I believe that Don Cheadle was the best actor in this film due to the role he played and the way he showed his emotions. the scene i remember most is when Paul is looking for his wife.The part of the film that made me feel good was when Paul's family were hiding in the shower.The best bad guy in the film is the leader if the interhamwhe.Paul was the best good guy due to what he did to save these people's lives.I would gladly recommend this film to people between the age of 13-16.I chose this age group because it is very informative of what really happened not long before their birth. 0.13641975308641976\n",

I remember seeing \"Schindler's List\", and all I could think about was how this movie portrayed Spielburg's classic as it occurred in Africa.Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Cara Seymour and Desmond Dube all gave wonderful, heart-wrenching performances. There are many scenes that gripped me so subtly that I didn't realize that I was holding my breath until I realized that I was still in the movie theatre. The movie draws the viewer in, especially in the scenes concerning the threat against the lives of Paul's family and friends.To think that so many stood by and allowed such a thing to happen puts me to shame just thinking about it. This movie raised so many signs in front of my face, and I was surprised to find that when I asked several of my friends about Rwanda, those that had not reached high school didn't even know about the genocide, or that Rwanda was even a country!Don Cheadle, the Academy Award Nominee for this movie, said that he wanted to \"prevent Hotel Darfur\" from being released. In Sudan, things very similar to this movie are occurring, and need to be stopped. I can only pray that this movie continues to bring awareness to those who were blind to the truth. I know that awful things are happening everywhere, but the fact that the genocide could have been stopped just sickens me.This movie is recommended for only the stalwart of heart, despite the fact that the carnage and bloodshed is kept to a subtle minimum.

      "A lot has already been said about Hotel Rwanda. Don Cheadle stands out as always, because he is one of the greatest actors of his generation - right up there with Jeffrey Wright and John Seymour Hoffman. Therefore, I only have a few points to add.The name of the movie is a play on Rwanda's other name, the \"Land Of A Thousand Hills\", or in French, \"Pays des Milles Collines\". The refugees are housed in the Milles Collines Hotel, or Thousand Hills Hotel. Therefore, Hotel Rwanda.The cast, although often excellent, is miscast because they are not Rwandans. In fact, half the cast have Zulu/Nguni clan surnames (Dube, Ndlovu, Sithole, Khumalo, etc.). I imagine it was filmed in South Africa? Durban, perhaps? :) This makes the comparison between Hutus and Tutsis a bit irrelevant though. Sophie Okonedo is not a Tutsi, but biracial and Nigerian/English. This is a minor point and not to disparage her acting achievement, but with the repeated statements that Tutsis have 'lighter skin' or 'longer noses' etc., it actually plays into the misconception of the 'difference' between Hutus and Tutsis.The Hamitic Race Theory, which is at the basis of the original discrimination by Belgian or German authorities is not clearly spelled out. It is not only applicable to Rwanda, but also to the present conflict in Western Sudan (Darfur). The pro-government militias are portrayed as 'white Arabs', horse or camel riding, where the population of Darfur is portrayed as 'Black African', and sometimes even Christian and Animist. This is the revisiting of the once extremely widespread Hamitic Race Theory, the theory that maintained that all culture in not only Africa, but Asia and the Americas should be explained by the diffusion of a mythical white race (which could be Black, Asian or Native American looking whenever it had to be). At one time, anthropologists tried to find the remnants of this race of 'blackened whites'. In some regions like South Africa, this theory is still taught in schools. Any nomadic, tall, cattle herding people (like the Masai, the Dinka or similar people) were classified non-Black and Hamitic and superior to the agricultural population of 'true Negroes'. The fact that 'superior' herders had the worst land, and 'inferior' farmers had the best land, which white settlers coveted, was of course an added bonus and an extra assurance of the popularity of the theory. Masai good, Kikuyu bad. Tutsi good, Hutu bad. Etcetera, because this kind of schism was repeated all over colonial Africa. People with bad land were pronounced to be 'superior', and people with good land were classified 'inferior', without any sense or irony or contradiction. This also has to do with the way colonialism functioned, which was no different than the way the Romans governed their newly gained territories - divide and conquer. A minority was picked out and proclaimed to be 'superior', and they were given privileges (education abroad, positions in local government, they were allowed to keep some land) and used to govern over the majority.Don't believe everything you hear on TV, but do your own research.

      "Recap: Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a luxurious hotel, Milles Collines, in Kilagi Rwanda. Deeply involved in the business the hotel does, Paul makes relations and friends with as many important and powerful people he can. Because there is trouble growing in Rwanda. Two \"tribes\" live together since the colonial time, and now there are a lot of hatred for the other kind. A Hutu-militia is already acting very threatening, and the Hutu-dominated army is not ready or willing to stop it. The peace is fragile. So when the president of Rwanda dies, everything breaks lose. Paul, a Hutu, ends up with his family, Tutsis and a lot of Tutsi friends at Milles Collines, where Paul bribes, collects favors, calls everyone he knows, lies and pulls every trick he knows just to protect those inside his walls. Outside, there is a genocide going on. The UN is powerless, and the outside world is only interested in rescuing their citizens.Comments: A very emotional, deeply touching, and very appalling movie. The tale (equal the truth I'm told) is told in a very realistic and plausible way. A lot of strong and frightening scenes are included, and a lot of them left me with a bad taste. That included when the UN and the Western powers abandoned the people in Rwanda. I'm old enough (unfortunately I don't have to be very old to do so) to remember the actual event, and I am dismayed by the fact that this move touched me more than those news did. In truth I am ashamed of it. So, as you surely can conclude, I think this is a very powerful movie. And it was made very well in all aspects. Especially a brilliant performance from all the cast, and mostly Don Cheadle that are mainly in focus. He brings us through all the emotions, love, hate, fear, terror, friendship, honor and actually happiness. Masterfully acted. I do recommend this movie to all and everyone, but I must warn you.

On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened.

Now, let us break down the word genocide, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines genocide as \"the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group.\" Does Hitler pop into your mind? Well, less then ten years ago (in your lifetime) this event happened. The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place. Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide. Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for over a thousand caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines. \"When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms,\" a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict.

      "Like many inhabiting this board I feel a deep sense of shame for my country and the West's abandonment of Rwanda to its fate during the 90's genocide. This film based on a the true story of Paul Russebigina a hotel manager who struggled to survive and save some innocents a la Oskar Schindler.Although Hotel Rwanda goes some way towards redressing the deliberate ignorance of the West over the genocide in Rwanda it is a far from perfect film. Its main flaw that undermines the film greatly is its sanitization of the dreadful bloodshed, naturally for commercial reasons. This 'chickening out' though counterbalanced at times by the bodies in the street and some mild violence makes the Rwandan Holocaust seem a relatively insignificant event.Come on! Millions died for God's sake and we are left with a director and a script pussyfooting around the real issues. Instead the film focuses on one man Russebigina and his family.I must admit the standard of acting in this film was very high with Cheadle and his wife in the film making a heartrending couple, whilst Nick Nolte plays a very believable UN Officer ashamed by the Wests conduct and doing his best whilst being placed in a tactical straight-jacket. It is not the fault of the actors that this film that could have been better then Schindlers List fails to reach those lofty heights and I hope that the next film in the genre of War Crimes (possibly about Bosnia, Iraq or Sierra leone) goes no holds barred and depicts man as he is at times: a terrible animal. 0.14200000000000004\n",

      "Hotel Rwanda is a remarkable film that borders between social commentary, documentary, and character study in the Main Character - Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed brilliantly by Don Cheadle.Filmed in South Africa, it includes documentary film of actual events woven subtly into the film.The film resists a tremendous amount of temptation to lapse into social preaching, shaming and condemnation of those nations that stood by or left in the advent of what can only be described as genocide; despite the unwillingness of those countries that fled, to use the word. The subtle nature of what does exist in that realm, is in fact more effective simply presented in the overwhelming imagery of the unimaginable, horrifying scope of events as they played out.It boggles the mind that the Western World could have been so complacent and indifferent. In the US at the time, we had more important things to focus upon in the media. The O.J. Simpson Trial took center stage and this did not raise to the level of importance to even be a lead story. Bill Clinton identifies this as his single greatest regret of his presidency that he did not use his power, influence and resources to act. There is no excuse that can be offered to justify that lapse. Bill Clinton in this instance, more than any other, had greatness within his grasp to act with the greatest impact upon Human History and demonstrate the values he claimed to possess. Yet he failed to do so. We in the US failed along with him.Paul Rusesabagina presents a rich study in Character and Leadership. Others examining this film have identified his leadership in the film as situational and there is no question that a strong progression takes place from the beginning of the film where he cannot go beyond his gate in watching a neighbor brutalized to the end of the film where he has taken personal ownership of the fate of over 1,200 refugees to the extent that he is willing to remain behind and send his family to \"safety\" without him.On may argue that circumstances dictated responses, and there is no doubt that incredible pressures skewed the responses portrayed. However, there were choices to be made and alternatives available that seemingly offered more direct or immediate results. What we witness is a man faced with impossible demands and challenges who must reach deep within to draw forth a higher level of leadership, a servant-leader who elevates the needs of others above his own.Overall, this is a remarkable film. One can only hope that the multitude of lessons available to the astute listener will be learned. There are few films that have the potential to impact one's life. This film can, if you will let it. 0.16040476190476194\n",
      "Regarding the fact that most people don't know that much about the massacres in Rwanda, this movie was necessary to show the shocking things that happened and the rejection of help by the western countries. However, I don't think people bring the critical acclaim the motion picture - not the documentary - needs: Many actors and actresses did a rather poor job, especially Nick Nolte was really disappointing in my opinion. I appreciate the directors job for delivering a movie with tension and the information every viewer needed, but after the parts couldn't make me believe they really happened because of the in some scenes crappy performances by the UN-Guy and Paul's wife which just let me realize that even if these things happened, they don't seem as real as they could if the actors would do a better job. That sucked the special quality out of a masterpiece: Great shocking film with information everybody needs to get, some errors in the performance that this story does not deserve. 0.015126050420168066\n",

Then the nurse telling them that there is no room on the bus and Paul (main character) says that there is always room and he is walking next to a lot of children. The acting in this film was okay.

      "This movie has some good moments, but it's mostly spoiled by the constant hammering home of the message: the West is racist because it didn't stop the massacres. If you accept this premise, then you'll probably find the film moving and meaningful; if you don't, then you may find it manipulative and rather shallow. Don Cheadle's performance is very good, and there are several moments of real tension, but I couldn't stop feeling that almost everything in the movie was designed to bludgeon the viewer and provoke guilt. As for me, I don't think France should be the policeman for the world, and neither should the United States. I see no reason that a boy from Kansas should have to die in Africa, Iraq, or any other place in order to make it safer for its own inhabitants. 0.2951666666666667\n",

The real aspect this film should bring to the viewer is how lucky or blessed we are to live in a republic of the United States of America. If nothing else, this movie should bring some awareness into your life.Don Cheadle's performance is so excellent in this movie, just brilliantly acted all the way around by every actor from top to bottom. It's said that close to 3 million people were killed during all of this in Rwanda.And then 2,000 miles away Somalia was having their ordeal as well during the time that this movie takes place. The film Black Hawk Down shows the struggles 'in a day in the life in Somalia'. Almost a million were killed in Somalia when it was all said and done and overall in Rwanda and Somalia about close to 2 million people went unaccounted for, and I can only guess that probably half of those people were dead and were just not found.A truly great movie that Hotel Rwanda is, so very thought provoking that it will make you think twice about how 'bad' it is where we live(meaning the U.S.) The United States isn't perfect, believe me, but it's truly a blessing to live here, and we shouldn't forget that.

As the manager of a hotel, at first Paul just wanted to protect the hotel from destroying. When he learned more and more Tutsis got killed, Paul made up his mind to save Tutsis refugees as possible as he could.The whole saving process was quite thrilling. Paul and his family also experienced the test of death. The following scene was impressive. Paul persuaded his wife to take the truck, though he remained in the hotel. What a touching parting.If Paul lost his conscience that human being should own, the story would be totally different. Only conscience can make the world peaceful. If conscience always exists, the unfair phenomena will disappear from the present crazy world.Don Cheadle's performance was full of appeal.

At the end of the day, this film is still poorly directed; has poorly delivered, cringe-worthy dialogue; some kind of product placement in every other scene; two dimensional characters; glosses over the genocide by only referring to it and never actually showing anyone getting killed; has gaping plot holes; and for some reason tries to put the blame of what happened on the Europe and America.

No person with a pulse could help but be moved by this movie. As a human being first and as a Black person second, I was grief stricken to see how people from the same country and of the same color could relentlessly kill based upon a stamp on an I.D. card.

In this movie there was bravery, cowardice, honor, humiliation, kindness, and ruthlessness.

Why fight in Iraq? They don't want our help. The Rwandans did. The story tells you about a true story about a man named Paul Rusesabagina Who opened a 5 star hotel to Tutsi refugees. He was brave and was willing to do anything to help people. Now Hotel Rwanda (Don Cheadle) Gave a great performance. Don Cheadle played Paul Rusesabagina. He is a hotel manager of the Mille Collines.

Tatiana's brother came and started to talk about the big war that is coming he said when they say their words The Big war would Start. Paul said don't worry We'll talk tomorrow. Couple of hours later the radio said their words. The elite squad the Interhamwae started killing. the killings got worse. They brought buses for the white people to go home safely while Rwandans are being killed. The friend of paul who's the leader gave paul some more supplies.

      "When I first heard about this movie I was very excited. Critics were comparing it to Schindler's List, which excited me further. But when I got to theater I realised that Hotel Rwanda was rated PG-13. I instantly knew it was going to suck. Generally, when you make a movie about a mass genocide in which nearly a million people died, your movie is going to be rated R at the very least due to massive amounts of blood and violence. Hotel Rwanda had nothing of the sort. The only time people actually got killed in the movie was when the family which the movie follows are huddled around a TV watching the news which portrays people being hacked by machetes from about 100 yards away. The rest of the movie featured people coming very close to death, but never actually getting killed. If you knew nothing about the mass genocide in Rwanda, and saw this movie, you would assume it consisted of a bunch of nancy boys running around not killing people. There is no blood in this movie at all. Comparing it to Schindler's List is like comparing Evil Dead to Legally Blonde - blasphemy. If you liked this movie then you are a mindless robot programmed by Hollywood to shell out eight bucks every time another blockbuster bore-a-thon comes along. -0.012023809523809518\n",
      "Obvious comparisons to SCHINDLER'S LIST can be made, and this is not the grim masterpiece that film was. This one plays it safe and conventional a bit too often, hitting discordant notes of forced Hollywood catharsis and grand moments and the like. I disliked Joaquin Phoenix's pro forma guilty white liberal, and I think Nolte was simply miscast as the impotent UN general.All that said, the movie succeeds far more often than it fails. For every wrong note there's a bunch of absolutely right ones, and some of the dramatic crescendos are riveting (the bodies on the road and Cheadle's subsequent breakdown, for instance). Those who would criticize the movie for it's conventional structure ignore the power such conventions have: an event like the Rwandan genocide is beyond any one viewer's ken to grapple with -- it is these very conventions which enable the viewer to engage with the subject matter.Cheadle is superb as the hotel manager who becomes a reluctant savior. Throughout he's a man consumed with the value of appearances; what's fascinating is we see him plausibly shift from believing in a phantasm-like symbol behind those appearances to using his skill with appearances to accomplish other, better goals. Unlike SCHINDLER's Liam Neeson, Cheadle is a real, plausible human being. I think this is the best thing he's ever done in the movies. As his wife, Sophie Okanedo does a fine job with a rather underwritten role: it's to her credit that she makes such an essentially passive character believable and memorable.Has it's faults, but mostly very fine, and shamefully does not seem to have garnered the audience in America it deserved. 0.1292792792792793\n",

      "Last summer, I watched a lot of DVD movies. I decided to look at this website for some good movies to watch, and I had come upon this movie, \"Hotel Rwanda.\" I heard that this movie is excellent, so I decided to give this one a shot.I thought everything about the film was excellent. This movie was based on a true story, and everything in this movie was all exciting and dramatic. Being a huge fan of movies and watching DVDs, I say that \"Hotel Rwanda\" is a highly recommended movie for those who have such an interest.Oh, and by the way, look for the odd thing out during the vault scene, too! 0.2971212121212121\n",
      "The story is familiar enough in its outline that I'll pretty much skip it. Basically, Don Cheadle's character, a hotel manager in Rwanda during the genocide, manages to save most of his family and more than a thousand Hutus who would otherwise have become victims in the slaughter.It's sometimes reminiscent of parts of \"The Killing Fields\" and \"Salvador,\" but it's more modestly done. No grand, sweeping shots of ten thousand extras; no repetitive shots of machetes hacking up innocent people. It's the story of one ordinary -- well, maybe extraordinary -- guy who wheedles, bribes, and blackmails until he gets his charges out into neighboring Tanzania.Yet, though we see little of it, the horror hangs palpably in the atmosphere. Cheadle's character is driving a van full of supplies back to his hotel in the middle of the night and the van begins to bump and lurch on a suddenly rough road. Cheadle gets out and discovers he's been driving over piles of corpses which cover the road as far ahead as he can see.The UN forces are present but almost (not quite) impotent. I lost track of who was doing all the killing -- there is the army, the rebels, various factions -- it hardly matters. The Hutus are killing the Tutsi children so as to wipe out the next generation. It's difficult to tell how this differs much from the Serbs raping rival women in order to impregnate them and produce a next generation that is at least half-Serbian.Perhaps half a million people were killed in Rwanda in 1994. The rivers and waterfalls were choked with naked and mutilated bodies. And little attention was paid by most of us, just as there is little attention being paid to events in Darfur as I write this. Our general view of human nature is that we are flawed but perfectible. Maybe we're just flawed. Maybe what we need is a signal of surrender, the kind dogs have, in which the loser rolls over on his back and the victor straddles him, looks around, and growls. Alas we have no such signal. The hand of the Intelligent Designer shook.Cheadle's performance is better than just good. He's VERY good. He darts about wearing the same expression, wheeling and dealing, being reasonable, until we think that's all there is to him. Until there is a scene with a corrupt general who swigs out of a bottle of single malt scotch and muses about his visit to Scotland. \"Good golf. I wonder if I will ever visit there again. Do you think so?\" Cheadle, meanwhile, sweat pouring down his face, has been frantically stacking bottles of scotch in a crate to bribe the general, paying no attention, and he replies unthinkingly, \"No,\" then looks up and adds quickly, \"I mean there are many things I believe we should all do in the future.\" The scene ends with Cheadle's man who embraces realpolitik finally losing his temper and shouting wide-eyed at the general that some day there will be an accounting for all this and who, if not Cheadle, will be around to testify for the general. The transformation of the character from polite and subservient to angry and threatening is shocking. And it is hard to believe that Cheadle could have been one of the undercover Narcs in \"Traffic.\" He's exceptional.His wife, Sophie Okonedo, is compellingly beautiful in a most ordinary kind of way with her plump pouting lips, her Egyptian eyes, and her narrow-shouldered vulnerable frame.But, really, all the performances are pretty good. If there were a temptation to turn the white folks into villains, it was successfully resisted. I'm not sure -- I'll have to look it up later -- but I don't believe the distinction between Tutsi and Hutu was created by European colonials. Probably the measurements and all that took place, and perhaps the laying on of hands ceremony, but if I remember the Hutu and Tutsi spoke different languages and were of different somatotypes to begin with. Not that it matters much.The movie is both gripping and instructive. A great candidate for showing in classes on international affairs and social change. Throw it into a philosophy class while you're at it. Let's see what they make out of human nature. 0.08264332399626517\n",
      "I was disappointed in every aspect of this movie. The events that were supposedly depicted, including the background of genocide in Rwanda, were insipidly portrayed, pure Hollywoood hokum. The casting was mediocre, especially Nick Nolte, but also including most of the smaller parts, although Don Cheadle and his wife were portrayed competently. It was an obvious attempt to take a single series of events--the actions of this hotel manager--and parlay them into a typical movie format, when the Rwandan genocide deserved, indeed deserves, much more significant treatment. The one redeeming feature of the film was its portrayal of the cowardly and bigoted manner in which the West dealt with the tragedy, but even that was done without impact.

In other words, I was one of those people who let this happen, and didn't even bother to notice. Cheadle deserves the Oscar, in a walk.

      "Simply stunning! After seeing Boogey nights I wasn't sure of Don Cheadle's acting ability, but he proved me dead wrong here. This film not only tells an important story in world history, that makes people aware of the atrocities faced by the people of Rwanda in 1994, but also shows the power of hope and how it of all things cannot be destroyed in a man. Don Cheadle and the entire cast of Hotel Rwanda is simply breathtaking in this biopic tale of the Genocide in Rwanda and the one man, Paul Rusesabagina, who risked his own life to save the lives of 1200 others.Though the story is very disturbing at times it is worth it to watch this film to make people aware of the interdisciplinary world so that something like this will never happen again. I don't know how Cheadle and this picture was almost completely overlooked by the Academy as it not only highlights the great acting ability of many actors but also tells a very moving and important tale.The film itself is almost flawless.

Maybe a bit too emotionally manipulative but powerful and unforgettable nonetheless. Exceptional performances and a look at a continent I had never seen presented in this way before. You may not be in the mood to emerge from a movie ashamed, depressed, and emotionally exhausted, but from a humanist perspective, this movie asks what I think is a fundamental question, that is, \"Why are people so cruel?\" There are no easy answers to be found here, only a politically charged slap in the face. 0.04166666666666667\n",
      "**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The Rwanda genocide were happening during about 100 days. As far as the authorities could count, about 1.000.000 were slaughtered, butchered, killed... a brutal hunt due to deep political issues between what we all define as upper class and lower class. Terrible.This is, as I use to say, an important movie. Shed the light on a genocide that took place in a country \"only themselves cared about\". With just those first words, the whole situation and repulsing actions could point to the darkness of insanity. Many thoughts were let through as I watched this motion picture. One of them were that I had only \"heard something about terrible events in an African country\". This is why these movies is so important. If movies can gather the whole global population in a good and human way, let the movies do that. It can be a fantastic change. I am so glad I turned on this film and were able to grasp what happened down in Rwanda. Mr. Paul Rusesabagina; was he a hero? In the aftermath, there were information coming from a hotel guest during the real activities that Mr. Rusesabagina took money to keep the people at the hotel, with priorities given to the wealthier people. Is it correct to call Mr. Rusesabagina a hero? Only taken consideration to lives, he helped people to survive. About 50 years later from World War II, another man took action and saved lives. In WWII, it was Oskar Schindler.I can perhaps missed myself information in this movie about exactly what the story and history behind the genocide were. Perhaps I just filtered that through as I enjoyed the movie. On the other hand, if the writers Keir Pearson and Terry George left out some of the background information, this movie may miss the target a little bit. I myself researched a little around this devastating event. With that background information, I could in a better way understand and grasp the entire story and motion picture.Let's all make an effort to create a world where we wish each other well and treat each other well with good will. Where we desire that we all feel good. Where we all should take the chance to be the best versions of ourselves. Where we care about each other. Where the conditions are created to become competent adults and good individuals.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Authentic scenery. A soundtrack that gives the film a little push to enhance the drama. Editing in some scenes could have been better. A few times I could see some errors and strange things from cut to cut. Especially one time, the acting were suffering due to bad editing (quick talk between Paul Rusesdabagina and madame Archer). - The actors : Academy Award nominees. Questions to that one? - The story : Magnificent work to bring light upon the genocide. - Entertainment : Left me with both a sad and happy emotion thinking of all of us humans on this planet. Important and entertaining. - Age : 15 due to brutality and blood7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

      "This true story shows audiences both the best and worst of the human race as we see a man use every bit of his wits and tact to save 1,200 lives while the rest of the world turned it's back and ignored the atrocities that were taking place. Story is set in 1994 in Kigali, Rwanda where death squads are formed by the Hutu's after their leader is murdered and they engage in genocide against the Tutsi tribe. The manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines is Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who is a Hutu but his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is a Tutsi and she and the lives of their children are threatened so they take refuge at the hotel.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The hotel chain is Belgian owned and many Tutsi refugees end up coming there until the count reaches about 1,200 but the Hutu armies start to come around to find them. There is a United Nations presence led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) who does his best to protect them and try to get them out but his hands are tied as his orders are strict in that he cannot get involved with trying to maintain peace. Paul talks to Generals and death squad leaders and uses bribery, lies, and tact to keep everyone alive until the United Nations can get them out but the roads are blocked and supplies have run out.This is only Terry George's second effort as a director and with this powerful film he has clearly shown everyone that he is a director to watch from now on. The strength of this film comes from different sources but along with the true facts that this is based on the performance of Cheadle is one that is extremely crucial to the story. Cheadle gives us a character that even amid horrible circumstances (and even his own safety) he uses his clear thinking and controlled nature to keep not only the hotel running but to keep everyone alive. In a powerful scene Cheadle changes his clothes and attempts to tie his tie but with everything that he's witnessed he finally breaks down but the key is that it happens when he's alone. After he emerges from changing he proceeds to run the hotel as any manager would and I believe this moment in the film sums up what the character is about. George has made an important film that people should view just so that the genocide that took place will never be forgotten and it also marks a career defining role for the versatile Cheadle who after giving audiences many good performances in previous efforts shows that he is indeed a very special actor. 0.15662287903667213\n",

The straightforward and by-the-numbers direction of Terry George service this tale very well, as it allows the fact based and ultimately uplifting story to speak for itself and allows the actors (most notably Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo-both rightfully honored with Oscar nods) to shine. There's a lot of heartbreaking stuff here both of a personal and political nature.

      "Hotel Rwanda is one of the best movies of 2004! This story recounts the true story of a Hotel manager who harbors several hundred refugees from a rival tribe during an intense Civil War in Central Africa. Marred by the compelling events, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) is forced to risk not only his own life, but the lives of family, friends and co workers in his attempt to save the lives of the helpless refugees.

      "Worth Watching Once - Disappointing. After hearing so much about how fantastic this was supposed to be, it was just so mediocre. Absolutely everything is stereotypical \"drama movie\" setup, drilling into our heads how \"sad\" we should be. Secondly, Paul (the main character) is not a hero. He does the absolute least he can all through the movie unless his wife yells at him to do more. He is a coward and I felt completely unsympathetic to him. The only good parts about the movie are the pure truth moments (usually when Paul isn't talking) informing us of the horrors of the actual situation. That alone makes it worth watching, just be warned of the other clutter. 0.02409297052154195\n",

We are shown that mankind is capable of acts of unimaginable horrors but also of incredible bravery and selflessness.

On the other hand, I thoroughly respected HBO's handling of this most sensitive and disgraceful Rwandan situation which was effectively portrayed by a virtually unknown cast of extremely talented actors. This is not to say that Don Cheadle and his supporting cast did not perform admirably, but I feel that the caliber of overall acting certainly did not warrant Academy Award consideration. 0.12595238095238093\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda, directed by Terry George, is an American film that depicts the genocide in Rwanda. The Rwandan Genocide arose from conflicts between two ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis. When the Belgians originally colonized Rwanda, they choose the officials to lead the country according to skin color and nose size that agreed with people in the Tutsis ethnic group. This caused a rift between the two groups thus leading to the genocide. Paul is a Hutu hotel manager for an upper class vacation hotel. His wife and most of his family are Tutsis which eventually leads to their endangerment. After the genocide starts, Paul is dumbfounded by the atrocities that are committed by the Hutus. With the safety of people in mind, Paul decides to help protect Tutsis people by letting them stay at the hotel after all the white vacationers fled from the violence. Paul continuously pays off the generals for protection and calls upon all his resources to help his family and all the refugees as well as stop the genocide. Paul eventually is able to help many of the refugees escape along with his family and two stranded cousins whose parents had been killed. This film is an amazing film that helped me learn and understand the Rwandan Genocide. I would recommend this movie to everyone in order to help educate people so that history does not repeat itself. 0.2527777777777778\n",

      "Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the actors, some who are famous did a really nice job by acting out exactly how the people in Rwanda were feeling during the Rwandan genocide. Although this is not a foreign film, it is very educational, because one who has never really heard about what exactly happened during the Rwandan genocide or know anything about it, can learn something new by watching this film. I particularly liked Paul the best in the movie as he was also one of the main characters. He took the risk, by taking in refugees that were going to get killed, and let them stay in his hotel, which I thought was a very audacious thing to do. I really liked the way that he cared for the other Rwandan people, since he was the one to step up to save them. There are many things that I enjoyed about this movie like, the way it was filmed, and the scenes and emotions that the people showed, but it would have been even better if this film showed the effect that the Genocide had on the Rwandan population and the younger children. This film stressed Paul as a heroic character, not only did he protect his family, but he protected others. I thought this was a great movie, and based on this reasoning I would give it a 5/5 . 0.31062121212121213\n",

We never get a bird's eye view until the end - we have no idea of who's alive, what's going on or what help is arriving. The violence is horrifying and the reactions are palpable.

Even so now thinking back on it, the portrayal of such an event with so much compassion is so smooth that the desired affect is reached.

A brilliant job capturing, on a personal level, the horror of the events (although, from what I understand, the horror was actually far worse than what we see in the film).

That was a great decision, all of people understand Paul can easily save him self and his family, but he still save all of them, even he have a chance to go away, he choose to stay here and help everyone here who can't go away.

But I did go and it turned out to be a compelling political thriller, on a par with famous ones like \"The Quiet American\" or \"The Comedians.\" The twisting story helped elucidate the political complexity. To the extent that the story is true, it showed the remarkable courage and ingenuity of Paul, his wife, and a UN peace-keeper, all operating under unimaginable pressure. A compassionate corporate CEO provided critical support. We see how these societies are controlled by corrupt officials until power struggles erupt among the corrupt. Ironically, Paul was only successful because he knew how to play the bribery game. As has been pointed out Cheadle and Okonedo, and most of the cast, were perfect.

      "It's films like this, whether one hundred percent historically accurate or not, that convince me that any suggestion of 'world peace' is merely a pipe dream. Here you have two warring tribes within the same country that can't get along with each other, resulting in death and bloodshed involving over a million people. And for what? When you come right down to it, what was the essential difference between Tutsi and Hutu? None that I could tell, and quite honestly, none that most of the evil Interhamwe could tell as well unless one admitted to being one or the other. It just makes me so angry.And as for the United Nations, what exactly is their purpose if they can't take a principled stand in the face of genocide and slaughter? Any minute I was expecting Nick Nolte's character, General Oliver, to take matters into his own hands as he witnessed the persecution and beatings, but no. He was handcuffed by a set of principles laid down by distant bureaucrats with the threat of losing his command if he didn't follow orders.It's hard not to wind up being cynical after seeing a treatment like this. I have a t-shirt that states 'Losing Faith in Humanity, One Person at a Time', and this film is the embodiment of that sentiment. The real life Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed by Don Cheadle, is a living saint in my book, having the courage and selflessness to look beyond his own family and personal circumstances, to put his life at risk to help both Tutsis and Hutus escape an impossible situation. His most powerful scene, in my estimation, was when Paul realized that the world community was not moving forward to help the Rwandans, challenging his hotel guests and the targeted Tutsis to reach out to anyone they personally knew who could possibly help their situation. It was such a travesty that he had to implore them all to 'shame the world into sending help'. 0.03808106575963719\n",

It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country. I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped. If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can.

His accent, his emotions, his courage and integrity were impeccably executed. Sophie Okonedo, who played Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana, was also excellent.The film seemed almost like a documentary at times (hand-held camera?) and crystallized the dilemma of man's inhumanity to man as only pictures can do.Over 800,000 men, women, and children were slaughtered in a period of a few months.

This movie is American made so we get the happy ending that we do not usually get in this class. The film uses great camera angles. For example I remember seeing a pan of all the dead bodies. Horrible sight to see but very well filmed. I understand that the UN has the job of keeping peace but they should have done more earlier in the film to help the Tutsi. The UN is a lot more helpful towards the end of the film rather than the beginning of it. It is very mind blowing how the Hutus just wanted to wipe out all of the Tutsi just because they were different than them. Tsotsi are smaller, lighter colored and also referred to as cockroaches. I believe that the world should be ashamed of what happened in Rwanda. None of the superpowers helped at all. It makes no sense that America did not intervene because we stick our heads in literally everything.

I watched this movie with my teenage son, and felt it was important for him to not just \"see\" but to \"feel\" the sense of dread and fear that the people of Rwanda were feeling-which this movie portrayed very well. Some movies go over the top with the graphic scenes for the shock factor, and some movies portray unrealistic heroes-the knight in shining armor that saves the world-but this movie was very real for me. The actors did an excellent job portraying emotions of fear, horror and confusion of the Rwandan people along with love, graciousness and humility.This movie kept our interest from start to finish. I think this is Don Cheadle's best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role, but one very powerful statement that I believe hit home for many people.

It was explained as a really horrific thing which had mass killings of people, that's why going into this movie I was interested in what I would be shown. The way the movie started gave me the American movie type feel, having a successful man with a family running a hotel and of course the language of the film being in English. As soon as the killing started I couldn't quite see why it did, but it turns out the reason was that one ethnic group disliked the other, that's all. In my opinion, the most horrific scene in this movie was when Paul was driving down the \"clear\" road and it was really bumpy and foggy out. Then they discovered that the road was full of dead bodies.

Don is on screen in just about every minute of this fabulous film, and each scene is acted with strength and emotion, and the fact that he was on in almost every scene while doing such an incredible job was alone enough to give Don a best actor bid at the Oscars.

I think that it did a really good job of portraying the horrors of the genocide to the viewers. On top of that, it showed that no country came to the aid of the Tutsis. The UN was there, but they did nothing which really shocked me. I thought that in a humanitarian crisis like the Rwandan genocide the UN would be very concerned and have a lot of involvement in helping the people, but they did not seem to be doing anything at all. I hope that in future crises, the UN would have much more of an impact to stop deaths from occurring.

      "Hotel Rwanda was a well- made film, with some famous actors. It was interesting to see Hollywood actors in a film that seemed foreign, although it wasn't. I did not know very much about the Rwandan Genocide, or the history of other Genocides. Overall, I liked this film, but it was definitely not my favorite because I did not understand it as much as I did the other films; I found myself lost during some parts. My favorite character was Paul because he was so determined. Paul was such a big part in this movie, since he showed that he was not only a good person and hero to his family, but those living in the hotel.His issues made my stressors and issues in my life feel like nothing. Not only was dealing with the genocide, but he was living in the middle of it, AND had to manage an entire hotel! Although it was not his fault by any means, It must've killed him to see all of the families and their children sleeping in the hallways of his hotel every time he was trying to get by them. He must've felt some responsibility and guilt for them having to sleep on a cold floor, especially since he had a wife and children of his own he probably thought of when he saw these people. I also liked his wife, Tatiana a lot as well, because she was so devoted to Paul, and she seemed to keep him in line. I liked that she was a loving wife and mother, but also was not afraid to die for her kids or Paul, since she was so tough. Although we saw struggles of both Paul and Tatiana through their eyes, I would've liked to see more of the kids' struggles and how THEY viewed what was going on. I kind of wish that there was more interaction between the kids at the hotel and Paul and Tatiana's kids, because they were a big part in the movie too since they were so vulnerable. The difference in this movie compared to most of the others, was that there was not violence in the sense that the community was so troubled such as guns and gangs, but because of war and the genocide. So what is the crime really like in Kigali, Rwanda? The crime that is most prominent today is theft and vandalism, at a rate of about 36%, which is considered low.Next, at a rate of 26%, is drugs and people dealing drugs. Violent crimes are less common than petty theft. Interestingly, violent crimes are less likely to happen to a foreigner than a local, as well! A study done in 2015 shows that there has been an increase in robbery in homes, but it mostly happens when people are not in them. Overall, Kigali is a pretty safe place, compared to the other countries in the films we have watched. 0.11642701525054462\n",
      "There is a certain sadness, a certainty of sadness in stories like this, and the movies that tell them.It reduces to us being made to care for a very few souls and then celebrate when our chosen people escape the fate of many others around them. The cost of this dynamic is straightforward: we have to make the others die, often horribly. It is a cheap sort of drama, the cheapest, the basest. It dehumanizes us because we become complicit in dehumanizing those that are sacrificed so that we can have a perhaps challenging but comfortable theater experience.We'll see it in blockbuster movies, when some alien invasion or natural event kills millions (or billions) but we follow a few that escape. We'll even see it in the shootouts of ordinary magical gun movies where the others drop one per shot while our guy wondrously and gracefully kills.But in this case, the tragedy is real. It really happened: a million people killed in as much time as a summer vacation: killed by neighbors with machetes. A million people killed because we stood by. The film does make a very central point, but not clearly enough. There are two warring tribes here, Hutu and Tutsi. But genetically they are identical. They speak the same language and culturally are the same. The difference? Belgium race theorists created the difference so that they could turn over the country to those they believed genetically superior, and that superiority determined by body and facial proportions. The accursed \"golden mean.\" (The distinction until then was one of class.)We do have Nick Nolte in the role of Privileged-Non-African-on-the-Spot. Joaquin Phoenix as a reporter supplements his role. They have the task of letting us know these facts and also that the genocide was easily preventable if a few troops had been sent in, which could have happened but for French and Belgian obstruction. No more than ten bureaucrats in Europe — whose names we know — killed a million while the local church helped.With that sad background, we have a hard time celebrating the survival of our hero and those he saves. This is made harder because the drama is poorly constructed and executed. It not enough that the wife be a good soul, or that the hotel manager be resourceful, or that many cliffhanger episodes are pulled back from near disaster. It is not enough that two little girls are found at the last minute and whisked to an adjacent country with laws and safety. It is not enough. It almost is not anything.The camera could have been used. We know how to do that. We had a camera on screen in a ready role. There could easily have been the power of effective cinema brought to this event, this reportage,When you make a film that involves political events so significant, you take a responsibility.

      "For starters, I really enjoyed watching this film. The first time I watched it, about 4 years ago, I didn't really pick much up from it. The second time I watched it (this time), I understood so much more and the movie left a much greater impact on me this time. I never really knew there was a genocide in Rwanda, or in any countries really except for the Holocaust. This really opened my eyes about third world countries and in how horrible of a condition most are. One thing I really enjoyed about the film was production quality in general. It has definitely been the highest quality movie we've seen so far in my opinion, aside from films like City of God. I also liked how there were some famous actors in this movie like Jean Reno and Don Cheadle. I feel like these actors helped the movie a lot in terms of how many people would go see it. Since people want to see movies with the actors they like in it, why not make the movie about a serious global issue to bring more eyes to it? There weren't many things I did not like about the movie, if any at all. I felt like some of the not famous actors didn't do the best job, but they still made the movie great. I really liked in the end how Paul and his family found the lost kids of their family friends and how he adopted the entire group almost of lost kids. 0.2338888888888889\n",

Would recommend it to all who are tired of the run of the mill movies out there. The tale is of courage,of cunning, of survival and is true.

How he deals with having to juggle his position between the factions that he belongs to and that of his wife. In bits and pieces, it is all there. And the end is amazing.

Credit where credits due, the actors did an absolutely spectacular job when it came to showing the emotions of their characters. Don Cheadale did an absolutely amazing job as Paul, not only being able to convey the stress and worrisome emotion but also by showing us just ho Paul struggled with many decisions during the entire Tutsi and Hutu conflict. Sophie also did a spectacular job playing Tatiana. The way her anger was portrayed on screen as she screamed at Paul about how he left her almost made me feel as if I was being yelled at personally.While this movie does touch on the subject heavily I just wish they did a bit more to explain the situation between the Tutsi and the Hutu. Sure, we get a tiny explanation about it during the beginning half of the movie but we never dive any further than the surface level information to understand just the basic plot; one side hates the other which causes genocide to ensue. 0.1198412698412699\n",

      "Fairly accurately, I suspect, 1994 Rwanda is depicted as a nation where intimidation and bribes control everyday commerce. Don Cheadle in a superb performance is Paul Rusesabagina, the assistant manager at a Belgian hotel in Rwanda. Paul becomes manager after the president of Rwanda is killed by insurgents, and the white manager flees. Instead of trying to cover the whole conflict, with millions killed by rival tribes, this movie focuses on this person, Paul, and his efforts to save over 1200 by welcoming them into the hotel, while doing what he could to stall the insurgents who wanted to kill all the \"cockroaches\", their name for those being killed. They especially wanted to kill all the children, to prevent that generation from growing up.I suspect the movie is mostly accurate, as the real Paul Rusesabagina was a consultant for making the movie, and he is also featured on an interesting DVD extra, where he takes us back 10 years to the places and events depicted in the movie. Nick Nolte has a key role as Colonel Oliver of the UN peace keeping force. As was described, they could not do much to stop the genocide.Not a pleasant movie to watch, but an important one as it shows a dark side of the world we live in.

The film, a true story, is set in 1994 when the Hutu and Tutsi's began a bloody civil war. The main character is Paul who works in a fancy hotel. His wife is a Tutsi and her race is the target of the Hutu who intend to kill every single one. With the UN pulling out and the world deserting them, Paul ends up hiding about 1000 Tutsi's inside the hotel. This is not a pleasant film to watch, I sat there full of dread waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. There is one scene that is even more horrifying when you remember that it really happened; Paul and Gregoire are driving through fog along a very bumpy road.

How could the great powers not have intervened? What is going on today we should be more aware of?I'm confused on a couple of points: How long a period did this cover? Swimming pool was almost empty in one scene. Was is made clear or were we left with an impression of what happened to those remaining at the hotel at the end? If so, I missed it. Did the hotel ever re- open as a Belgin (or other) enterprise? 0.12302083333333336\n",
      "It is a powerful portrait of a slightly befuddled man who, when inhuman demands were placed on him, found within himself an unexpected response. The owner (Don Cheadle) of a hotel in Kigali opens it as a refuge for imperilled Tsutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Hotel Rwanda is a powerful slant on a crisis that shook the world, but not to the extent of stepping in: it works mainly as a conventional salute to one man's bravery, but Cheadle handles the demands of his role superbly. The film was nominated and won several awards in 2004–2005, including those from the Berlin and Toronto International Film Festivals. 0.1738095238095238\n",
      "I watched it recently, the plot of the story was fantastic but also shocking. Every scene had suspense. The movie painted a picture of what all people need to realize, that other countries are at risk, and this movie tells a lot of that.Genocide, violence, death, and murder, teach us all that the world is not perfect. The movie really touched me and startled me to find that so many places have stories like these, and we don't have to time to recognize them. This movie taught me to see the bad things that happen around me.Many people can benefit from this movie by learning about what really happens in other countries, and what we can try to do about it. -0.11500000000000002\n",

      "I loved this film. After living in Sub Saharan Africa for many years it was refreshing to see a film that portrayed people there as humans rather than caricatures. It also should shame us in the West for the complacency over situations there, often caused by our own selfish politics.This film intersperses the sadness and tension with wonderful flashes of humour and little touches that remind us that people are people even in the most horrific circumstances. The film also assumes no prior knowledge of the reasons behind the genocide, but explains the situation in a way that is understandable and natural rather than getting in the way of the narrative.See this film, if it moves you great, but if it causes you to question why the West can treat large populations of the world as less than human then even better! 0.19324229691876751\n",
      "I am going to be honest, I had no idea that this even existed before watching this movie but after watching it I feel as if something has been kept from me. I cannot believe something as horrible as the Rwandan genocide was something I did not know about until now. I will say however that as of the movie itself it was very entertaining an definitely pulled on your heart strings a little. A lot of the time it made me aggravated at certain characters but that was definitely on purpose. I hated how gregoire acted the entire time. He was probably my least favorite character in the entire movie by a long shot. -0.036401098901098904\n",
      "When Terry George decided to make this film he did so in order to tell the story of one man's struggle to protect the lives of his family and of those taking refuge under the roof of the hotel he managed. The manager, Paul Russesabagina (Don Cheadle) awoke each new day to find an ever changing set of rules to follow and new rulers to appease with bribes. Paul only learns about the massacres taking place outside of the hotel through radio broadcasts, photographers, medics and UN peacekeepers.I don't believe it was crass (as it has been stated on some reviews) to focus on the story of an individual who survived the massacre as opposed to the lives of nearly a million who were murdered. I think the viewer gets the idea that a genocide is taking place, we feel it as the boundaries surrounding the hotel become breached and any semblance of protective help is being pulled out of the country. In fact, one of the most heart wrenching scenes takes place during an evacuation of all non-native people. On the bus to safety we can see every type of person on board who isn't a Tutsi. Even dogs are allowed on the bus, just not any of the Tutsi people. As the bus pulls away from the hotel, the gravity of the situation is all very clear to those left behind. And as this is the story of the incredible survival of Paul Russesabagina and those he was able to save from a certain death, his story becomes all the more remarkable.Terry George has helped to shine a light on a massacre that went largely unnoticed or ignored by millions of people. He did so by focusing the story of the movie onto one man's struggle for survival. Perhaps by making this movie he may have also helped to make us more aware of our place in the world at large, so that we may better shape any upcoming acts of genocide to occur in the future. Or perhaps we'll stay insulated in our own heads with images of celebrity, comfort and consumerism where \"the tragedies of today are tomorrow's bargain matinée\".For those who have read the above header and think it to be crass, you would be correct, it is crass. However, that doesn't make the header any less true. I could have titled it, \"Shop Hotel Rwanda\", but the thoughtful people from Amazon.com have already beaten me to it (look over to the right for the advertisement link). I really don't believe that Amazon.com put any malicious thought into the shopping link for the movie consumers that surf IMDb, the link is a completely automated provision that is supplied to every movie in its database. But you could understand that someone, perhaps most people, would be offended by it. I'm sure the header I've thought up for this movie review will offend someone, but I can't say that was my truest intention. It may be a cynical thought, but it happens to be true. What light it is seen in is entirely up to interpretation. I believe Terry George had the best of intentions, I don't believe he made his movie to be crass.The important lesson to be learned is that of learning any lesson at all. Even after watching \"Hotel Rwanda\" and being deeply affected by it, I wonder if I'll be able to live outside of my own head. I hope we have learned, but I realize that there was a time when the world at large looked the other way while a million people were slaughtered; now they can click on a link and 'Shop Hotel Rwanda'. 9/10 Clark Richards 0.22786353797717435\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda tells the harrowing, and as far as the West is concerned, disgracefully story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel owner in war torn Rwanda who shelters over a 1,000 Tutsi refugees from certain death from the rampaging Hutu people in 1994.Don Cheadle is an acting tour-de-force as he as proved when given the opportunity (Traffic) and not given roles which waste his considerable talent (Oceans whatever).The supporting cast is also excellent, Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife, Nick Nolte as a helpless but strong U.N peacekeeper and a small, but excellent role, for Joaquin Phoenix as a U.S war reporter.powerful, shocking, dramatic and uplifting, films like Hotel Rwanda should be compulsory viewing as a testament to man's inhumanity to man and the West chooses to ignore these events when it's Governments see no 'profit' 0.10119047619047622\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda is a great motion picture. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in these kinds of issues. Don Cheadle leads an excellent cast who bring you deep into the story. The story of the Rwandan genocide is a deeply touching story and this movie fully represents that. Although much of the violence that occurred in the Rwandan genocide is cleaned up for rating and audience reasons the movie still alerts the audience to the issues of the genocide that were hidden at the time. The reaction of the western world is surprising but true. The scenes can be disturbing with graphic images but its all worth it to understand this piece of history. This movie was deeply touching. It can get a little intense at times so i would recommend that you are prepared for this before seeing the movie. Hotel Rwanda is a great movie and the actors portray this harrowing tale brilliantly. 0.31365740740740744\n",
      "Synopsis: Set in the middle of a civil war brewing in Africa the world glares on as men, women and children from the Tutsies are butchered and massacred. Paul, a businessman and Hotel manager is forced to take people into his hotel, a UN safe haven and no go zone for the Hutu rebels.A compelling story with powerful performances especially by Don Cheadle who plays Paul as the protagonist. This film shows us the true meaning of compassion and tyranny as two opposing forces on the ontological spectrum of our existence as humans. Paul goes through hell and back to ensure the safety of his family and friends, moving us and taking us deep into the abyss of the morass facing mankind.

      "This is a very amazing movie, this movie is about species fight, I like it very much. It is Hutu and Tutsi's fought, the cause is Tutsi, because they shot the airplane which has Hutu president. Then Hutu counterattack, but I don't think Hutu power is good, because they killed Tutsi refugees, not Tutsi rebels. I think Tutsi power is not good, but is also not bad. It is not good, but they shot the airplane which has Hutu President. He is not bad, because they didn't kill Tutsi refugee, and they would not kill native people, but Hutu power also killed native people which didn't kill Tutsi. I like this movie because of it is a real thing, so the plot will not like the main chapter is very strong, and he always win. The plot is good. You will felt shock first, because one scene was Paul and his employee drove the car, and when they entered a path, Paul found the path was bump. Then he got off, and found the reason. He found many corpse was on the path; I was feeling shock in that moment--the path was full of corpse. But you would fell amazing at last. Because Paul used his own power to save Tutsi and Hutu refugee, first, he bribed many people to help them. Second, he imperiled general to let general had to help them.

      "Finally, a movie that is based off historic events that were brushed under the carpet a long time ago. In this case, the movie takes place during the Rwandan genocide in the year of 1994, the moment when the world turned its back of the Rwandan people. But one man opened his arms for the refugees and protected them from the genocide until help arrived. The fact that this actually happened, just boggles my mind.Ah right, the movie. Well as far as the story goes, its perfect. It has drama, action and describing of historic events. Now the only thing left is the acting. And honestly Don Cheadle is the perfect pick to be the main character, they both share similar characteristics between each other.This movie had me on edge the whole time and i definitely recommend watching it. 0.17011904761904764\n",

Whilst watching this film, the most important (but hurtful) emotional experience for me was the reliving of the pain I felt when I saw a documentary about Rwanda a few years ago. This movie really hurts - in a good way. But that will probably limit the business prospects. The good acting pulls you into it because you feel with the main characters. And it makes you think a lot about how this world has to change and how we could find instruments to minimize cruelties like the murders of hundreds of thousands of children, women and men that happened down there in Rwanda and in other places. 0.06324955908289241\n",

It shows the continue corruption of the political system all of the world.Also how lives depending on race and culture does not have as much value as others. Even within ones owns race.

      "Obviously Hollywood can't really show what the violence was really like during the Rwandan civil war but even what this movie did show it would be enough to frighten any kid who happened to watch it. However, even with the restrictions of recreating the war the cast did a great job of showing the intensity of what happened at the hotel staff, the UN soldiers and the refugees there. There were times that the movie had me on the edge of the seat and so I cannot imagine what it was like to actually experience the genocide personally. While the movie focused on Paul Rusesabagina, it did a great job portraying the other important people at the hotel like Madam Archer and Colonel Oliver. While this movie can't show everyone who fought against the genocide the few people it can show it does an amazing job and I would recommend it to anyone. 0.22291666666666665\n",
      "The world needs to know what happened in Rwanda in 1994. This film is an emotionally powerful and true account of hotel Milles Colline's manager Paul Rusesabaginga's (Don Cheadle) wit's and bravery in saving over a thousand lives from being slaughtered during the Rwandan genocide. Although the film deals with difficult subject matter it wisely does not concentrate on the most gruesome of details. Perfectly cast Don Cheadle puts in the performance of his career. When the genocide was happening the world turned blind and deaf. Terry George speaking at the world premiere of this film didn't have an easy time finding support for this film project. In an age today where most films are mindless we need to be reminded of our humanity and it's capacity for bravery and inspiration.

      "Hotel Rwanda is the amazing and heartwarming true story of Paul Rusesabagina, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle. Paul owns a hotel in violent Rwanda during the civil war. The Hutu and Tutsi people are at odds and Paul is a Hutu and his wife, Tatiana, is a Tutsi. In the midst of the war Paul sees the atrocities being committed to his fellow Rwandans and makes his hotel a safe haven for refugees. The film is incredibly moving. Although it shows the horrors of life in Rwanda during the war, with people being dragged from their homes, murdered, and living scared for their lives, there is also a humanity and uplifting aspect. The compassion that Paul and his wife have for the refugees and the risks they are willing to take to keep those within the hotel is heartwarming. One of my favorite things about the film is that it doesn't shy away from portraying the Rwandan conflict and the genocide that is occurring and brings the country's issues to light. The film has raised awareness of the genocide and telling this true story brings some hope to the situation. Cheadle is amazing in the film and carries it. His performance is convincing and moving, he is the perfect man for this role. 0.4035714285714286\n",
      "Everything you could expect out of this movie comes at you. It is a very perfect way to show everyone what occurred during the rebellion. The story all starts when Paul is working at the Hotel and everyone that is there is somewhat very powerful and has a great influence on what goes on in the world. I was surprised seeing it was only a 4 star hotel. An anonymous voice is always heard on the radio that seems to be very angry and filled with revenge. Now, before you watch this movie, you should get a back story on the Rwandan Rebellion between the Hutus and the Tutsis. I'll help explain a little bit, but mainly, the Belgians came in and decided who was to be a Tutsi based on their looks and they were given their position instead of earning it. Due to this, the Hutus eventually had enough of it and the man on the radio said something about falling trees and then instantly the rebellion began. Every Hutu was instantly killing the Tutsis, all based on the separation that occurred only based on a different countries opinion. To me, this is ridiculous, but it is what it is. Another main point is the fact that no other country would get involved, or saw it as a huge problem that they needed to stop. Paul was left at the hotel and eventually it turns into a refugee camp for the Tutsis, now you will have to see the rest. It is a must see! 0.1042857142857143\n"

      "Hotel Rwanda is just amazingly moving and devastating. Many critics believe that the real complexity of the history between the Tutsis and Hutu's is far too simplified into goods guys and bad guys. However, watch and listen closely, then you do hear about the background information. Still, the movie was trying to make a point, and that was done extremely well.I don't care what your view on it is as a movie, although I did think it was a great movie to watch, but one thing is true, you have to watch the movie just to face the reality of today's world. The Rwanda genocide happened only ELEVEN years ago. It makes me wonder, about the problems in Sudan right now, will we be having another movie about that genocide in 11 years from now again?!?!

      "This movie was absolutely horrible!!!!!! Horribly good. I cried so many times. I cried for the Paul, the main character and his family. I cried for Rwanda and the innocent people slaughtered. I mostly cried because of my ignorance and the ignorance of America and other influential countries/province. I'm sad to admit I was not even aware of these issues. This movie puts you IN Rwanda. One moves from watching this movie in their comfortable chair to being there in the madness and corruption. Many compare the movie to Schindler List. Horrific wise, sure, any holocaust is just that, horrible. I do not think it is fair to do so production wise because the former is a Hollyowood produced film while the latter was independent. Furthermore I thought the director did an excellent job engaging the audience. With just enough slaughter shot to familiarize you with the environment without making it a gory movie. I'm so glad a the common face of Denzel Washinghton was not present. That would have completely moved the focus from Paul struggle to \"Denzel Washington with a funny accent\" struggle.

It's a very emotional movie and at some stages you find your self on the brink of tears. Other times your body is full of hatred towards those cruel and horrific Hutus. I highly recommend this movie as its an important part of understanding the cruelty of this world and learning to stop and do something to helps those struggling throughout the world.

      "\"Hotel Rwanda\" tells the story of a local hotel manager, who becomes a hero when he lets countless refugees, whose lifes are at stake, stay in the hotel in order to save them from persecution during the civil war in Rwanda. At the same time he has to face the destiny of his own little family and learns the hard way that his country is not within the western focus.In many ways this is a typical Hollywood production and it sure doesn't push barriers in terms of filmmaking. But what it does is putting a conflict on the map that most westerners barely know as a news headline and giving both the victims and their persecutors a face. In times like these it is ongoingly important to be remembered how absurde and horrifying war really is and also what responsibility lies upon every one of us in order to do what is within his posssibilities to do good. The main character here is not an angel, he has his own interests, trades with the worst people and prioritizes. But when he was needed he took action and saved many. It also shows that such people need help and that we as westerners have possibilities to grant it to them but too often don't care enough to do so.All in all this is a movie with an important message and some very intense scenes, not a gamechanger artistically but a strong film. 0.1190432098765432\n",

The movie started when the war was already pretty much in full swing so the context of why was missing.

Hotel Rwanda was a very important film and it will stay with me.I am shocked and angry there was no coverage of this atrocity. I can't believe someone could make a decision to not call this \"genocide\" and not attach \"newsworthy\" to this event. The writing was excellent but the acting was unsurpassed. Sophie and Don really captured the realism and fear from this terrible massacre. I saw Ray and Foxx was great. But my vote would certainly go to Don Cheadle!! This movie is worth watching. It's very disturbing. But you can learn a lot from the DVD behind the scenes look with the real Paul. He goes back to Rwanda and actually sees the lime-coated real human remains of the children and adults killed in 94'.

Based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who sheltered more than 1,200 Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan massacre, Terry George's \"Hotel Rwanda\" -- beautifully constructed and directed, with a career-defining performance by Don Cheadle and exceptional supporting work by Sophie Okonedo -- is one of those pictures. \"The Passion of the Christ\" was the movie most alleged Christians were hyped up about this year, probably because it allowed them to feel self-congratulatory about their willingness to wallow in their savior's suffering. But \"Hotel Rwanda\" is the picture that really captures the essence of Judeo-Christian values: It takes the measure of our compassion for our fellow human beings, and demands that we hold ourselves accountable for the things we might have done and didn't. 0.2716117216117216\n",

Don Cheadle gives a great performance playing Paul the hotel manager during this terrible crisis. The most disturbing thing about this truth, is it was in 1994. Something this barbaric and senseless could actually take place and did. While America was busy watching the OJ crisis, this was taking place and getting little if no attention. Sadly things of this nature have happened or are happening all over the world every day and yet goes unnoticed from other countries because it doesn't pertain to them.

      "This is one of the best movies I have seen. Certainly the best so far this year. I am embarrassed to say I was ignorant of the events in Rwanda in 1994. Like one character in the movie said, people in other countries will see this on TV and say it is so horrible, but then they will go out and eat dinner. This movie skillfully tells of the horrors - the conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus, the genocide, without overdramatizing it. It was more like telling the facts. It held my attention from beginning to end.SPOILERS AHEAD................I remember one scene is particular. Paul (Don Cheadle's character) and his van driver are returning to the hotel late at night and suddenly the road is bumpy.Paul asks the driver to stop the van and steps out. Actually he falls out because he has just stepped on a corpse, and then the horrifying scene- he is surrounded by a very large number of corpses.There are also some very warm moments in the movie- Paul's family, his friends, employees, acquaintances, and the 'powerrful' people- his relationships to them are portrayed beautifully. He uses all his negotiations skills to save lives of over 1200 people. Without him they would have certainly died. He was a real hero who never gave up.The acting and direction were great. Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul. I hope he will be nominated for the Oscar. He gets excellent support from the cast, and particularly Sophie, who plays his wife in the movie.It is hard to describe in words how effective this movie is.

      "I think Hotel Rwanda is a movie in a category of its own. It was so well done that it sent chills up my spine. It made me sickened, seeing the roads scattered with bodies, seeing the callousness of everyone in it. The whole world turned their backs on the country when it was in need. The movie did show, what I think, is an accurate account of how people acted during the time. I've only read one book about the genocide between the Hutsus and the Tutsis and that was more about the groups in Sri Lanka so it can't really be compared.The movie was very well done and I'm glad I saw it but I can see why some people wouldn't want to see it. It's so real that when you're done watching it you're disgusted with everyone. I especially feel like the few blurbs on the news and in the newspaper that glossed over the situation is a sick joke. Never had I heard about the gravity of what happened until I saw the movie. Millions of people died and it seems the rest of the world just didn't care. Even here in Canada (which is normally interested in world issues, not just our own) dropped the ball.Anyone who failed to report the war and what was happening was almost as much at fault as people doing the killing. Because, if we had done something back then, then maybe so many people wouldn't have died.After seeing the movie I was left feeling emotional and I think a large part was Don Cheadle's acting. He was incredible in it and I think he should have won the Oscar that year (even though Jamie Fox did do a great job too). 0.15400000000000003\n",
      "Excellent movie. Great play by the actors. This movie will be remembered. It shows the constant and repetitive errors that the human kind does time after time. It it also a reminder that even if the world decided to not intervene in the conflict between the Hutu and the Tutsi, this could happen everywhere. Hatred, bigotry, racism and territorial preoccupations fueled this conflict but the abandonment of this part of the world after an avid exploitation by the European countries did not help either. Ultimately, the conflict depicted in this movie shows the terrible consequences of previous acts on a complete civilization. 0.1111111111111111\n",

One man opened his heart, while the world closed there eyes. This is the best film I seen in a long time. Its uncut and honest. And you feel the fear true the hole movie. How one nation can suddenly dived like in Rwanda is not easy to understand. Insects has more value than people in this film. If you want to watch a film who you never forget, this is one of them!

      "Hotel Rwanda (2004): Dir: Terry George / Cast: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Fana Mokoena: Powerful film about the security found in one place. Set in 1994 where war runs rabid in third world countries Don Cheadle plays a hotel manager threatened with death when soldiers and tanks patrol the streets in search of refugees. Bodies litter the street until Cheadle opens his hotel for others to seek safety although he is running out of resources to bribe protection. Director Terry George captures the conditions and emotions of the event but he also portrays a Biblical allegory with regards to one man risking all, including his own life for the benefit of others. The performances are in top form although Joaquin Phoenix is too brief to warrant necessary. One wonders what he is doing there in the first place. Great performance by Cheadle who pulls off all the stops while struggling to survive himself. He is backed by Sophie Okonedo as his wife who shows support and concern. Then we are given a scene stealing performance by Nick Nolte who appears as a soldier whose best scenes appear towards the end when all chaos breaks loose. This is a well made film that technically conveys the atmosphere these people were stricken with. Strong themes of self sacrifice rewarded in this tense and suspenseful independent film.

      "This was an amazing movie, incredibly made, and is definitely Oscar- material. But I just wanted to say, this movie should NOT be rated PG-13. I went to see it last week (I'm fifteen) and was sobbing throughout the whole feature. It is really thematic and intense, and, although I'm glad I saw it, it should have been R. They never show too much, just enough to get the story across, but some of the scenes are really emotional and disturbing. If you think you're up to it, by all means see \"Hotel Rwanda\" but don't bring ten or twelve year olds unless they're really mature. \"Hotel Rwanda\" puts small children in dangerous situations and has many dead bodies. It is kind of telling that our rating system puts movies like \"Billy Elliot,\" \"The Matrix,\" and \"Motorcycle Diaries\" in the R category because of homosexuality, swearing, violence and leprosy but won't rates a movie about real-life murder and genocide PG-13. 0.11842105263157894\n",

This movie is certainly a true master piece, a corner stone in movie history. Don Cheadle is in general a great actor but his performance in this movie is far more than excellent. Character development, story telling, directing and acting is truly professional. You can feel the drama as the story progresses. It reminded the cold face of the truth. Our humanism, democracy and all other nonsense that we like to talk about is nothing but a pile of lies. We all watched millions killing each other and we did nothing. 0.12307692307692308\n",

The film quality was great and the movie got you emotionally attached through the vivid use of emotions by the director to display the hardships these people went through. The movie also helps to display the massive change that occurred as a result of the Hutu movement and how the country was affected. Overall, this was an excellent historical movie based on a true story that was portrayed excellently by the director and the cast of this movie.

By pretending that somehow the African lives were not worthy. Don Cheadle portrays the hotel manager with such dignity, trying to keep calm in the face of the most distressing circumstances. Go see this movie. Haunting, sad but uplifting. This reaffirms my faith in the African continent. Most times we hear of the many who wreak such havoc and terror on their people but we need to be reminded that there are many Africans who strive to maintain the age old tradition of loving thy neighbor and extending kindness to others.As a west African (Sierra Leone), I thank the director for choosing to bring this story to the big screen.

      "Today,I've seen this wonderful movie which should be viewed by every people I consider. The film is about a history of Rwanda where it had been independent in 1994. At that time,the country has just parted into two sectors by the last reigning country,thus making the country trapped into the tremendous ethnic disaster. The hero of this story, Paul Rusesabagina,is a diligent and virtuous man worked in the utmost luxurious hotel in Rwanda. In the end,It is Paul who uses his property to assist the grieved people to get rid of their dilemma. To be honest,Hadn't Paul utilize his ability,the people in the hotel would not be secure.

      "Of all of the performances nominated for best actor in a lead role, Jamie Foxx's is the only one I've yet to see. However, after watching Don Cheadle give the performance of a lifetime/career in 'Hotel Rwanda,' I can say the Oscar voters got it wrong. This movie, which pulls no punches in rightly laying the blame for the Rwandian genocide, was staggering in its emotional impact. It, like 'Schindler's List,' is one of those movies you need to see again despite the fact that it is a emotional roller-coaster. I commend all involved for making it and think it should be mandatory viewing for high school social studies classes. 0.12238095238095238\n",
      "I am a bit surprised that those who write here have not seen how this film is reminiscent of Schindler's List, but rightly portrayed as current and urgent, as opposed to the safety of a long gaze and reflection back in history. I am not a Don Cheadle fan, but if he continues to turn in performances like this (and \"Crash\"), I may become one.The brutality and greed of chaotic modern Africa are aptly addressed here, and realities of circumstance make the main character's courage all the more palpable than, say, silly Hollywood action flicks might have us believe the nature of courage to be.The only reasons I did not give that tenth star were that I thought Nolte a bit long in the tooth for the role he was given, and the fact that many scenes are dark and hard to discern. I believe that both of these were intentional; the aging struggling colonel, and the sweaty dank feel of breaking news. But, I might have enjoyed it more if they would have been moderated in degree. 0.12053571428571427\n",
      "This movie was very personal for me because as a little kid of 4 I lived briefly in one of the Refugee Camps in Tanzania before moving to a house in a town nearby. This was an excellent film and I really enjoyed watching it and hope that the people who see it will remember what happens to people in a situation like Rwanda and act upon it next time. This movie should raise awareness for the plights of people across the world who are in trouble right now. Places like Sudan and The Congo are in the same dire straits as Rwanda was 11 years ago. Watching that movie brought back memories of the people who were fleeing the fighting and living in such primitive situations. This is a must for people. 0.12711038961038962\n",
      "I first heard about this movie when I was in college. The class I took was called Genocide literature... most of it was focused on the Holocaust, but the genocide that struck me was the one in Rwanda. No one ever talks about these things because no doubt it's a very hard subject, but the thing that sucks was the fact the Rwandan genocide was never shown on the news or the fact that the United Nations did very little in Rwanda.This movie about a hotel manager who saved over a thousand Hutu and Tutsi refugees is very much like Oskar Schlinder who saved over a thousand Jews during the holocaust. If you want to see more about genocide I strongly recommend that you watch Schlinder's List (this movie has many similarities to Hotel Rwanda) and Ararat (this one is about the Armenian genocide that happened during World War I). I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it was very well done and the fact that there were some excellent actors. 0.2128125\n",

I really never knew what happened in Rwanda before i watched the movie.The movie is much like a documentary which just don't let you go till the end.

      "What do I have to say other than I am speechless after seeing this movie and man do I love happy endings. I just bought the DVD and I saw it in the theater, it was such a great pacifist version of Black Hawk Down.Storyline: 9.5/10 The storyline starts with the spark of the Tutsi/Hutu battles in Rwanda and leads up to Paul Rusesabagina housing over 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees in The Milles Collines Hotel in Rwanda. The story was told fantastically with Drama, Romance, and brief periods of action.Characters: 9.5/10 The characters in this movie are actually believable and follow the stories of real people. Paul is a completely believable character and has nothing but love for the people that are being hunted by the Hutu people. His wife is compassionate and actually resents Paul at points in the movie.Soundtrack: 10/10 This is possibly the best soundtrack since the Lord of the Rings soundtrack in my opinion.Overall: 9/10(since i can't post a 9.875) If you haven't seen this movie please do.

      "Before watching this movie I didn't know much about the Rwandan genocide. I did a little research before watching this film in order to get some background to what I could expect. Google had told me that at least 800,000 people had died. This shocked me but the statistics didn't start to come to life until I watched the film. I cried about 3 times during this movie watching so many innocent people and very young children being killed. Paul Rusesabagina was put into danger countless times and was called a traitor by the radical Hutus. I think this movie does a great job at describing his story of saving many Tutsi refugees. I would recommend this movie to anyone because I think everyone should learn about history; however, I would warn them that this film is pretty graphic.

It will leave you assured of the ineptness and effectiveness of the UN. And it will leave you challenged - what responsibility do we have to help countries that are being dominated by evil? What is that quote? All that it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to stand by and do nothing? This is story of one good man and his heroic efforts. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

The acting in this movie invoked all of my emotions. I was glued to the screen. The acting by Don Cheadle was amazing. I was captivated by him throughout the whole movie. The whole cast did a great job reenacting the crime against humanity. I don't think that I could have done any of those scenes without crying like a baby. The bravery that Paul Rusesabagina showed was selfless and I wish that more people could be that brave. The fact that this happened and nobody would help these people was horrible.

The movie itself is plain and not a \"showcase.\" It doesn't have to be.

Sophia is amazing as Cheadle's wife, so natural. While Pheonix is OK, doesn't get a meaty role here. Nick Nolte is good too, in a well written role. The screenplay is outstanding. The Editing is sharp. This movie is FLAWLESS. Mark my words. This film will shock you. It's very emotional at times, so if you going to go see it, make sure to take tissues.

      "This is one of the better films that I have seen lately, and well deserving of the Academy Award nominations that it received. The film stars Don Cheadle portraying Paul Rusesabagina in a role in which he was nominated for Best Actor, also well deserved. The story is a retelling of the true events which occurred in 1994 during a Rwandan uprising which the Tutsi population of Rwanda was almost annihilated by the Hutu militia.Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is a hard working Hutu, who serves as the Hotel Manager of a Belgian five-star hotel, the Hotel Milles Collines, in Rwanda. He is married to Tatiana, a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo. Paul lives in a neighbor populated by both Hutu and Tutsi. As the movie begins, tensions are rising as altercations between Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels escalate. Rumors start circulating about a possible Tutsi coup, as Hutu military soldiers begin rounding up possible Tutsi spies in Paul's neighborhood.A full fledge genocidal war against the Tutsi population is ignited when the plane with the Rwandan President, a Hutu, is shot down by Tutsi rebels only hours after a peace treaty between the Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels is signed. Paul's neighborhood as well as much of Rwanda becomes the battle ground for the war, where only bribery, blackmail, and payoffs are your only survival.Paul is able to get his family and a van full of neighbors back to his Hotel in hopes that United Nations soldiers will protect these refugees. However, just the opposite becomes apparent. The U.N. soldiers are forced to take no stand on the situation before them. What's even worst, at one point of the film, the U.N. forces arrive at Paul's hotel in mass only to help to evacuate the European guests stranded there, thus leaving behind the Rwanda refugees to fend for themselves without any protection whatsoever.Paul becomes a one-man army whose only mission is to save the lives of these people. He is forced to plead to foreign nationals, manipulate generals, bribe the Hutu militia, and grovel to U.N. peace-keepers. He is willing to do whatever it takes in order to keep the atrocities, which are occurring just outside his hotel compounds, from entering their confines.This story is brutally told; it's both gripping and ghastly. Director Terry George pulls no punches; and emotions run rampant as scenes such as \"the U.N. forces departure leaving Rwandan refugees behind at the hotel\" just tears at the heart. It's a story of how one man overcomes insurmountable odds to make a difference, and it's graphically depicted. Again, this film is not for the squeamish; however, I highly recommend seeing it. http://farisreel.com 0.022577160493827172\n",

Terry our heartiest gratitudes for you and your crew for making such a touchy movie. You looked things in a different way. We must express the truth for future generations.

The massacre of Hutus against Tutsis recreated this very well and very real. Don Cheadle is superb, simply embodies his character and delivers this true hero was Paul Rusesabagina; Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic, her character is the most credible and he is unrecognizable.

Although million dollar baby was strongly dominated by excellent acting (Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank) but he overall theme and pace of the movie is completely opposite to this one.

It appears to me that when blacks are targets of genocide, this government suddenly becomes too helpless to assist. The movie was an eye opener, this is a film that everyone should see.

Don Cheadle acting was up to par and the realism was good with the AK-47 and the RPG that were used in the time. Something that got me was if they got back on the bus or it left without them. Also I was not aware that it was the FRench who supplied the Huto army. This was a surprising fact. Also what I liked was the sense of comedy that sprung up at tense moments. What I felt to be the most powerful was the scene with the bodies on the road. It shows what Pele do when it is supported by others.

The scene where all the orphanage children show up at Paul's hotel and are informed they can't leave the country and the scene where Paul's family and some of the other refugees are almost murdered by the Hutu militia were extremely painful to watch. The movie is powerful even from the beginning with the jarring scene of a box of machetes spilling out and the Hutu militia leader bribing Paul with more half priced beer. Nick Nolte also gives a powerful performance. You can tell he really feels bad about not being able to do anything about what's going on around him.

Let me just quote a few verses from the song that's ending the movie: If the USA can be the United States of America Why can't we be the United States of Africa If the England can be the United Kingdom Why can't we be the United Kingdom of AfricaThis is a movie you don't want to miss, trust me! 0.22724786324786325\n",
      "This was an amazingly wonderful heart-wrenching movie I watched in my seventh grade Social Studies class. I loved it. It was romance, action, perfection and truth all in one. It was a beautiful movie that told the whole story. By the end, many of my friends were crying, and they will not talk about Rwanda. I will, especially to help those in Sudan. In Sudan, the Janjaweed troops: white Muslims are killing black Muslims. It is a similar situation in Hotel, a very painful movie describing in almost no graphic images, the horror on such an event as a genocide for no apparent reason. In the movie, nobody really knows who to trust, but Paul trusts only in himself and survives. Also on the DVD is a documentary about Paul returning from his new home in Belgium to his old country of Rwanda. It is also amazing, you see real people from the movie, dead bodies, clothing, the hotel, the whole country unfolds as Paul himself tels you the story 0.13272121212121216\n",
      "I think it's a shame that this movie didn't win best movie at the Oscars. I really had my hopes up for it, not because I consider the Oscars that much of a deal but, because at least more people would've been interested in watching it. It is sad that people just don't know what happened in Rwanda in 1994, and that still are completely ignorant about what continues to happen in Africa. In cases like this you can't help but wonder if everything that the current US government says about helping other nations be \"free\" is just B.S. and realize that in cases like Africa there are no political or economical interests for them to intervene. This movie really makes you understand what people went through and how we thought in current years a thing like this wouldn't happen and it actually did without anyone doing anything about it. I also have to say, Don Cheadle's performance is amazing. 0.20138888888888892\n",
      "I recall seeing the previews for this and thought \"Oh God, they CAN'T make a Hollywoodized version of this tragedy.\" I had read Fergal Kean's book \"Season of Blood,\" which detailed the horror and violence of this event. Kean was a correspondent for the BBC and provided perhaps the most detailed account from a Westerner's perspective. The book is harrowing and hard to get through. It's not pleasant, and with the images from his account still haunting me, I didn't trust Hollywood to do things right.Thankfully, with Don Cheadle in the lead, and director Terry George at the helm, actively recruiting the involvement of the actual Paul Rosesabagina (portrayed by Cheadle), there was a responsible effort to NOT exploit the horror. I also think it was a good move to edit this to a PG13. Some scenes push the rating limit, but restraint allowed the events to emerge and not get overwhelmed by the violence. This film should be seen by young people, especially those who entertain themselves slaughtering thousands in realistic video games.The DVD has a strong commentary by both Director Terry George and Paul Rusesabagina that is truly enlightening. This was an embarrassing event for the World, and the fact that the UN and Clinton Administration did not classify this as a \"genocide,\" despite what news footage showed, is shameful. As I understand it, and as discussed on the commentary, if a genocide is recognized, the UN is REQUIRED to act and put it to rest. But politics of the time intervened. The Clinton Administration was still stinging from the mess in Somalia, and the UN really doesn't amount to much without the US providing military logistics.A good companion piece to this is HBO's film \"Sometimes in April,\" but it's far more brutal in its depiction of genocidal scenes. For a written account, find the above mentioned SEASON OF BLOOD; A Rwandan Journey by FERGAL KEANE, winner of the 1995 Orwell prize and published by Viking. Amazon or eBay should have it.I'll show Hotel Rwanda to my kids, but I'm waiting a couple years until they are both over 13, since I think the age rating should be heeded. The character of Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed by Don Cheadle is truly a heroic one. Here's a guy who didn't set out to be a hero, he just took responsibility. Scenes with his family are truly painful to watch, and anyone with children can relate to scenes of children gone missing and the desperate search for them. This film is a nightmare, but since it happened, and we know we don't learn much from history, it's good to see the \"other\" side of war. This is bigotry at its worse, on par with the Holocaust. Had the victims been white, I'm sure the reaction from the UN and the West would have been far different. Thankfully, Hotel Rwanda doesn't wear accusations of racism on it sleeve, but it's clear, especially when white tourists are hand-escorted from the crowd by UN Soldiers, even nuns carrying children, the black children pushed from their arms.This is certainly not a fun, dinner & date movie. It's not meant to be. It's quite a downer. I'd put it on par with The Killing Fields, Under Fire, and Salvador. There are a few films out there that can present serious events responsibly. Hotel Rwanda is one of the very few. No Rambo came to save everyone in the end. Tom Cruise doesn't hop from a tank or Porsche with a thumbs up and toothy grin. This story doesn't fit the Hollywood FORMULA.Tragically, I don't think we've seen the final chapter to Rwanda's sad story yet. Many Tutsis had no choice but to return to their homes, many the site of the slaughter of loved ones, only to endure neighboring Hutsis returning, the same who actually killed their relatives. What writer can create such an ending? The New Yorker covered the \"homecoming\" of both victims and murderers a couple years back. I don't recall any follow up.This film should be seen by young people. It shows how bigotry unchecked does destroy us as a species, and we cannot be defined alone by pigment or cultural heritage. It's cheesy, but we all bleed red. Thankfully, Hotel Rawanda chooses to not focus on the blood, which lesser filmmakers might have done. 0.053328523328523315\n",

      "One of the inspiring movie of the year. A must see movie to open your eyes about the reality.Usually American war movie shows only the good side of westerner. They help other country at war and becoming a hero, Even though most of the time they \"only\" help others when they want something from that country or under a big pressure from the world.This movie shows that westerner is the one who start the whole thing, which happen in other countries too.

      "The danger with movies like Hotel Rwanda is that the history swamps the story or the story doesn't do justice to the history. The story achieves a perfect balance between the 2 by not forcing a view of events on us rather showing enough of it's impact on the characters to allow us to form our own opinion.The characters are thoughtfully built up without being one dimensional and the acting is out of the top draw. Each of the characters evolves as the movie develops. We see the superficial being peeled away to reveal the betrayed Paul, the impotent yet heroic UN captain and tens of other characters that will stay with you.Don't go expecting to enjoy the movie rather go expecting to be moved deeply by it.

      "When a film chills to the bone, it is easily among the best of the year, and that's exactly what this film did to me when I saw it: chilled me to the bone. It's rather disturbing that so many people have no idea what happened ten years ago in Rwanda. I know I knew limited things about it. I knew people had died horrible deaths and that's about it. Seeing this story unfold about one man who wants nothing more than for he and his family to survive is something that everyone needs to see. Don Cheadle is that man and his work here left me speechless. I say the same thing regarding Sophie Okonedo. They had such great chemistry together and when apart their acting chops were just as strong. Terry George has done a great thing by bringing this story to the public. We are so selfish and we take so much for granted. This movie will make you realize that and so much more. Best scene: Paul staying behind and not leaving with his family. 0.1802277432712215\n",

      "Hotel Rwanda, the true story of Paul Rusesabagina and his unyielding endeavor to save over 1200 refugees of both Huti and Tutsi parties, is a poignant cinematic work of art. Though IMDb classifies this Drama, Thriller, etc., the best way to sum up this movie would be Documentary - Interesting Documentary, to be exact. The movie definitely got its point across with unspeakable acting. It's wonderful for a class setting - in fact, I am a student that has watched it today in World History class.Some may wonder why this movie was rated PG-13 at all; this movie obviously does not have sexual innuendo (with the exception of a few kisses here and there). One or two bad words were slipped out of anger and malice towards each other. It does not glorify racism nor violence; in fact, it shows clearly that violence is not okay. With the exception of a few historical errors, I trust this movie to be 100% legitimate in facts.Before you rent this movie - be sure to have a box of Kleenex; you will definitely cry unless you have no emotion. The last 30 minutes of the movie are the most poignant and heart-wrenching - something about those refugees drinking water out of the pool and huddling together in times of strife is sad. Paul's final beseeching to the general is the climatic scene, executed with emotion. But most of all, the slides after the ending credits is what breaks you down the most.This movie made me think about how malicious and selfish the UN as well as the US has been in that time. It just hit me after watching this movie that the situation in Darfur needs more help and could use it as well. I will be of age to have a voice in this country soon and will do everything to help save the Paul & Tatiana Rusesabaginas and Fendenses of the world.Watch this movie with an open heart, a steady mind, and prepare to be changed. 0.07388888888888889\n",
      "I generally do not enjoy films that, in essence, put the moviegoer in the auspicious position of being heartless if they do not empathize with the main characters or the story. This film is one of my few exceptions to that rule, and it is impressive through every frame. The story is inherently dramatic, played out like a chess game with meticulous pacing and an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina by Don Cheadle. The slight flaws in the film I can attribute to cultural differences which may cause certain scenes in the film to seem flawed based on my understanding of the Rwandan culture. Overall, it is an emotionally moving portrait of the Tutsi uprising and the struggle of Paul Rusesabagina to save his family and the lives of both the Tutsi and Hutu whom he had come to love as his own family.9/10. 0.04863945578231292\n",

The story begins with the Tutsi rebels and the Hutu army fighting and the Hutu president being ruthlessly slaughtered, this movie really shows how there are no good guys in war, it just depends on what side you are on.

      "Hotel Rwanda like any film of its kind, dealing with such huge subject matter (the slaughter of millions of Rwanda's people) has chosen to focus in on one story and use the human angle to explore the larger picture. So we have the story of one hotel manager who by saving his own family inadvertently becomes touched by the plight of many and turns the hotel into a kind of make shift refuge camp for the thousands fleeing the onslaught. Based on a true story the film is a classic one mans struggle against the inevitable with death the only other option if he fails in his plight. The film is well directed, scored and acted (special nod to Don Cheadle and the British actress playing his wife) my only criticism is that by giving the film a 15 certificate it almost dumbs down on the slaughter, not that I want to see loads of violence, but the bit we do see is so tame it never really has that much of an impact on you. It felt like a slap to the face when it should have been a hammer to the head. Saying that the story is still a harrowing one and not an easy thing to watch especially when you know it was the west who left those people to die.

What impressed me is that you don't get a lot of graphic shots - actually no graphic shots. There is less blood in this film than most episodes of CSI. The film assumes you are capable of understand the horror of the event without showing it to you. Don Cheadle has worked in crap like Mission to Mars, Ocean's 11, and Swordfish so the way he pulls out his role Paul Rusesabagina might shock. He really brings out the character who isn't some crusading hero but a normal man who brings the same talents to saving Rwandans that he used to serve guests at his hotel. He plays the role with such grace and ease that the character is wholly credible. The film's biggest emotion for me was less one of sadness than anger. Listening to an actual US State Department broadcast talk about \"Acts of Genocide\" get interrupted by a reporter asking, \"How many acts of genocide does it take before something is genocide.\" was maddening.

Colonel Oliver was a great addition and was cast perfectly. He played a strict, worrisome, yet caring UN Colonel and was perfectly placed in the story line. The characters that were supposed to irritate me certainly did there job. Gregoire and the other irritating Hutu's bothered me. This movie would've been a 10/10 with a little more historical context. I felt a little lost in the root of the conflict. The ending really rounded out the movie when they found their nieces. What. A. Great. Movie. 0.3133786848072563\n",
      "There is only one thing I can say after seeing this movie. They made reality too real. The horror lived by the Tutsi's was put on the silver screen with shocking realism and in gruesome detail. Hotel Rwanda represents bravery (about those who helped solve this conflict, focused on saving as many people as possible without concern for their own wellbeing), it cant also represent cruelty (about those who killed thousands of people because they had a different nose or lighter skin). Basically, It's a movie that symbolizes humanities strengths and weaknesses. It also shows us that African countries cannot overcome their own problems without asking Europe or USA (for example) for help. Through the entire movie bribes and favors are a constant subject. For me, reality doesn't make me cry, doesn't make me laugh, but It does make me think: How/Why is mankind capable of committing such atrocities? How/Why are there men capable of not respecting the meaning of life? How/Why are there men capable of respecting the lives of others more then their own? 0.073015873015873\n",

She is not pretty for starters; she is even taller than her husband. Have you ever seen an American movie with a star like this?

Next Sophie Okendako was also great as Paul's wife. She showed how hard it is to be in the situation that literally ripped there lives apart. The children were also very convincing and you could really see the how it traumatized them. There wasn't much gore but it didn't need any. It showed the horror of the genocide in Rwanda through the feelings of those who were affected. And what wasn't shown in gore you could envision in your mind.

      "Hotel Rwanda is a great movie and I enjoyed it thoroughly, I haven't seen many movies about conflicts in other countries, I do not think I have seen a war movie that did not include the United States. I never even knew this happened so it opened my eyes a little bit that other countries also have conflicts like the US and it was most likely even worse because it was a complete genocide and not just a regular war. Paul Rusesabinga is my favorite character in Hotel Rwanda because he saved everybody know matter what tribe they were from and what they represented, I also enjoyed how much he valued his family and his friends and would do anything to keep them safe, I also enjoyed the relationships he made with people and how if you are friendly and do right it will come back to benefit you, In conclusion this was an amazing movie and I would recommend watching it to everybody, at first I didn't know what to expect because of the difference of this movie to everything I have watched but I learned a lot from this movie and also learned not to judge something or someone without knowing the full story, so overall this was a great movie and I would definitely watch it again. 0.2569285714285714\n",
      "This movie is not what I expected from a movie with such a subject. You hear about genocide all the time, the UN colonel says it and I think the news team says it, too. But words alone won't do, not in a movie. All you see is a few hundred bodies scattered on the street. There are no close ups, almost no scenes where you actually see how the Hutu shoot someone and there is only little blood (genocide and no blood? Hallo?!). And as for the role of the UN I can say this: Colonel Oliver behaves like a small child whose lollipop was taken away. You get the impression all they do is standing around, waiting for some other team of soldiers who protect the citizens. This is so ridiculous. I was too shocked at the image of the UN to be shocked when I should have been. Furthermore the movie shows a short time span, so you don't get the context in which this war takes place. Only once it is mentioned that the Tutsi (who are now slaughtered) suppressed the Hutu. But of course the Hutu are the bad guys and we are not to like them. At this point the movie pushes the audience's sympathy in one direction. Although Hotel Rwanda is not a documentary, I would have liked to think about the conflict and decide who is right (if indeed anyone is) and who is not myself.There is one scene that really stunned me. After Colonel Oliver has learned the Quick Reaction Force won't stay, he talks to Paul. He then says something that made me feel ashamed. We don't care about what happens in Rwanda. Personally, I don't even know where this country lies and I didn't know about what happened there in 1994 until I saw the movie. Maybe this is the real theme of the movie. Our attitude towards conflicts in Africa or pretty any country in the world apart from our own and the ones next to us. We see the news, say how terrible war is and that was it. I am ashamed and I love movies which make me feel this way. Hotel Rwanda really is a must-see. -0.0478688350340136\n",
      "I can't believe this movie got made. It is so searing in its portrayal of man's inhumanity to man including ours. I felt so guilty that I had had no idea of the true horror of this civil war. It actually reinforces the accusation that the Western world never cares much what happens in Africa. Our media barely covers the wars, famines, droughts until millions of people are dead and then it seems like it is too late for the U.S. politicians to do anything. Great, great movie. Don Cheadle is a master actor. I wish I would see him in more films. Another thought I had about this movie is how it reminded me of the holocaust. America sat by and allowed 6 million Jews, Catholics and gypsies to die before intervening and it had nothing to do with the annihilation of the these people that got us finally into WWII. My own country embarrasses me. When will we ever use our great power to help others rather than accumulate as many material things that we can before we die? Why are we leading news broadcasts with someone like Paris Hilton instead of Nelson Mandela or the Dalai Lama? 0.24000000000000005\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda is an incredible description of the human race. A development of a film of reality of separation of race and power. Hotel Rwanda was filmed/released in 2004 reflecting a true story of one of the deadliest rivalry between the Hutus and Tutsis. The genres is a biography, dram and history of war of the Hutus and Tutsis; Paul Rusesabagina who is played by Don Cheadle become in charge of Hotel Des Milles Collines in Kigali. The twist is that he is a Hutus and married to Tutsis played by Sophie Okonedo(Tatiana Rusesabagina).This movie showed the struggle that we still have today as a society, division and power. Hakeem Kae-Kazim as George Rutaganda and Fana Mokoena as General Bizimungu are great representation of power and greed. Both individuals used their power to gain favors or take advantages.The theme of the Hotel Rwanda is main racism, which is the differences which acts as justification for a non-equal treatment. In the movie you experience general problems for discrimination including age, color, ranks, nationality.The Hutus focus on younger kids to eliminate the next generation of Tutsis. Color, the whites or other not from the country was treated differently. Ranks, individuals like George Rutaganda, Fana Mokoena and even Paul were separated from others because their ranks. One scene that describe privilege is when Paul was in trouble and knew everyone at the hotel would be killed and he made a phone call to the owner of the hotel and had the Hutus army removed from the property.Overall the writers Keir Pearson and Terry George did a great job capturing the violence and brutal death of 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsi. The editor had some great sounds effects and dramatic change of sound to alert the audience of danger.One scene that really hit home for me is when Paul and Hutus driver was returning to the hotel and started driving on a bumpy road and realizing that it was human bodies. This when Paul finally broke down from all the hurt and pressure to keep everyone alive. 0.1199074074074074\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda was the first movie that we have watched in English and it didn't really stand out that much. The other movies were just as easy to follow which was surprising to me. This movie provided a wonderful, yet frightening, reality of the genocide in Rwanda. It went into depth the struggles that all of the Tutsi citizens when through as well as the harshness of the treatment they received from the Hutus that were out to kill them. Paul was a very friendly and loving character who always was the center of most things and was nice enough to overflow his hotel with Tutsi guests who had no where to go. He seemed to know most of the people and have connections that were able to save him and others lives when in need. I was kept on the edge of my seat most of the time because really anything could happen at anytime.

Through my point of view I think this movie will be one to cry through. This movie shows us how thankful and grateful we are in the United States. For years in Rwanda under the Belgains, the Tutsis ruled and killed not but a few Hutus.

He was able to convey the emotions and tension so well. The entire movie was well shot, the audio and soundtrack was terrific and the scenes were honestly and truly moving. One of the best scenes was when the priest accompanied by a sea of nuns and orphaned children poured into the hotel. I was honestly and truly crying there. It was that moving. The only other time I've cried during a movie was during Schindler's List where Liam Neeson is departing the factory and he looks at all of his clothes and comments on how each article of his could have saved more people. I truly believe that these two movies had a lot in common. Both men were in positions of power and safety, yet they used their influence and money to benefit human kind.

What a Performance ! not to mention the charisma and energy of the his co-stars. Beautifully executed, splendid movie..Wars and clashes normally keep people away from such movies but this is one movie nobody should miss.

      "I watched this movie the other day and it was a knee-slapping, roaring, hilarious film. One character, named Paul, gets a huge load of customers for his small Rwandan hotel. The movie plays like a classic sitcom, with shenanigans committed by nearly every guest at the hotel. One of the funniest parts was when some guests didn't like the hotel water or something so they drank from the pool! Later there was a huge party, but it got out of hand and I think someone threw a firecracker at the hotel, comically freaking everyone out. I gave this movie a 9/10 because Paul's wife tried killing some guests or something with a flashlight, which wasn't really that funny. In all, this movie is a great film that surpasses even some classic comedies. I would review the actual plot instead of jokes, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to any comedy fan. 0.21955555555555556\n",

      "This film is based on a real event, the Rwandan massacre. Millions of people died in this huge massacre, Rwandans killing Rwandans. If you don't want to see some of the history introduce,(some may not be real) skip next paragraph.After WWI, The League of Nations give Rwanda to Belgium for their colony. At first Belgians distinguished Rwandans into two major groups, Hutus and Tutsis, and hand sone power to the Tutsis. Tutsi ruled Rwandans for lots of years. In about 1990, thee are a civil war between Hutus and Tutsis. At 1994, after the president has been murdered, There is a genocide to all of the Tutsis and Hutus which keep natural or towards Tutsis. The film is base on this events.Is our teacher who introduce us the film, and before the film start, even when we're watching, he would always say, \"Please don't laugh, be serious, this is a very serious film.\" In fact, no one laugh at all, we barely speak, though. Not because that this film don't have the \"laugh\" part, it's all of us knows you should't laugh even if you want. So what this film give to me, is serious, complete serious. Every move, every decision, every word they speak, will affect all of the refugees and even the hotel's safety. All of us stays in a serious mood, waiting the miracle to begin.The reason why I call it a miracle, is that the main character, Paul, he always save all of the refugees from danger. He is a real-life hero, I think. Apart from superheroes, Paul is real. They both save people from danger. But Paul is the one who is saving real life, he's not influential, but the decision he make, is a hero move.Sometimes people will think they're the hero, but in that time, I may not do the heroic move as Paul did. At first, I'll be a foreign passenger at the time, may be taken to the foreign airplane and back to China.

He gave his last savings just to save people that he didn't even know. I didn't really get the whole tutsi and hutu thing because it didn't really make sense but the whole thing was just stupid. Paul was a very good person but nobody really gave him much credit for it but im glad that they got out of there and moved to where it was safe.

      "A film of this proportion covering the 1994 Rwandan conflict would have to stock its shelves with a dominant and talented cast to create the sense of emotion that such a topic deserves. This film forms the harsh contrast of terrible truth in a world that we thought was civilized.Don Cheadle plays the role of Paul Rusesabagina, a real-life hotel manager in Rwanda who begins the film simply trying to save his wife, Tatiyana (Sophie Okonedo) and children. Supported by a UN General played by Nick Nolte, Paul becomes a savior, and his hotel is the only \"oasis\" for over 1,200 people in a nation filled with turmoil. As the world turns their back on his country, he realizes that he cannot turn away from the hundreds of people who look to him for strength.Cheadle gives a commanding performance in his portrayal of Rusesabagina. One realizes the ignorance of so many people in this third world country, and Cheadle shows a sophisticated and intelligent difference from this norm in each one of his actions. From his treatment of the orphanage children to the way he makes the President of Sabena stand up and listen, his presentation is truly inspirational.In comparison to the high-strung UN general played by Nolte, Cheadle is the \"eye of the storm\"; he beautifully illustrates the emotional strength and clarity of thought that had to be the only traits that saved the real Paul and his refugees.Okonedo, who plays Paul's wife Tatiyana, delivers an outstanding supporting role as a strong wife and mother who is a member of the Tutsi tribe that is being attacked. She is the main reason that Paul even allowed refugees in his hotel; begging him do save their friends and neighbors who gathered at their home. Okonedo excellently conveys the emotional strain of a woman in such a difficult situation.The story of what happened in Rwanda needed to be told by something other than the film camera crews that were on location. But to display the magnitude of what really happened, the resulting would need to put the viewer right there, in the middle of the action. This film provides the viewer a true story of Paul Rusesabagina who is a hero and a victim at the same time. Terry George creates a dramatic and emotional film with the location, the special effects, and the hundreds (possibly thousands) of extras that give the viewer a sense of how cruel and ignorant humans can be to one another.A difficult, but realistic film to watch, I have not seen something so powerful since The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Such a high-quality story accompanied by several commanding performances deserved more than a few award nominations, and many more wins; I expected to see the entire main cast on stage for the Oscars and Academy Award nominations. 0.11524725274725273\n",

The foreign power put the 1s in control and pretty soon they think they are really superior to the 2s. The 1s kill a million of the 2s (calling them cockroaches) before the 2s rise up and push out the 1s.While all of this is going on, a particular 1, played magnificently by Don Cheatle, becomes a Schindler of sorts and saves not only his family and other 1s but a bunch of 2s as well from the militia/military 1s before escaping behind the approaching \"rebel\" line of the 2s.Unbelievable?

The film is an utter masterpiece and is packed with suspense and sadness (not in a good sense, but representing the feelings that were happening at the time)The movie is a real \"eye opener\". It will probably make you want to investigate Sudan, where similar autrocities are happening as I type this. It will make you question humanity, and view humans no greater than a drunken dingo. It makes Titanic look like a Disney movie and in fact, you probably wont care about the people who died on the titanic at all when you finish hotel rwanda.The fact that this is a recent event happening little more than a decade ago brings a sort of sickness to your stomach. You realize that you were probably at school, or a child eating ice cream cones when 1 million men woman and children where gunned down and hacked up with michettes in rwanada in a 3 month period.As for the film itself. The acting was superb, the atmosphere was intense, the fear was lingering and the imagery was tremendous. I think however, Hotel Rwanda is more than a movie, way more, way way more. Its a true story... and the film itself is worth as much as the paper history books are printed on.I feel that if anybody doesn't watch this movie they would be disrespecting all those who died needlessly in 1994. as said in the movie by the Canadian luitenant working for the UN \"nobody in the West gives a S**T about African N***rs\".

The situation in itself was already so strong that we didn't need tons of blood splattered all over. They told a very violent history focusing on the human drama, the doubts, hopes, envy and so on. The most dramatic scenes were always happening from a certain distance. That made the film even stronger. It's a nice example of how it is possible to make movies about violent themes with sense and sensibility.

      "This movie is astounding. The events which it depicts are horrifying and astounding. Don Cheadle delivers an excellent performance and deserves the Oscar, the movie deserves the best film of 2004. It is so critical that a movie like this gets wide viewing in the Western world so people wake up and realise the kind of injustice that goes on outside their borders and in the world around them which they cannot see. With a topic as sensitive as this it was critical to display sufficient amount of horrifying massacre without making it so much that it overpowers the movie and seems like a Save the Children advertisement. The director did a superb job of balancing out the right amount of violence and did so extremely well. I was crying for most of the movie. The light humour interspersed between the tragedy was well placed and essential for both the audience and the accurate portrayal of the scene.

      "Hotel Rwanda was about the Rwandan Genocide that occurred recently. Almost a million people were killed in this conflict, many of them being innocent people who were blamed for crimes they did not commit. The Hutu extremists wished to exterminate the population of Tutsi's in their country, as well as any sympathizers to their cause. As a result, thousands were killed and the governments of the world didn't help to stop all of the killing until much later. This story instead focuses around a hotel manager who wants to get his people to safety and has to struggle against the Hutu extremists who wish to wipe out everyone in the hotel. After convincing others and offering them bribes and blackmail, he manages to extract everyone from the hotel. It was both a very sad and uplifting movie to watch.

The reasons behind this disconnect could be largely political, or simply due to general apathy or ignorance, but no matter what it is disturbing. This is a very important film that duly raises awareness to the atrocities that exist in today's society, and we must not turn our heads. -0.02318181818181817\n",
      "Dialogue over a radio opens Hotel Rwanda hinting at the impending genocide of the Tutsi people. The next few scenes play out with a sense of terror in the air as various snippets of dialogue encourage violent action. Paul Ruseabagina (Don Cheadle), a hotel owner and a Hutu, is married to a Tutsi. His marriage has caused tension with certain Hutus. Historically the Hutu and the Tutsi have not had the best relations. One morning this violent tension explodes as the Hutu begin killing all the Tutsi. Paul flees to his hotel and begins to hide and save the lives of as many Tutsis as he can.The film's tension creates a sense of danger throughout. The deaths depicted in the film are usually off camera or in the distance, allowing the viewer to imagine the horrific deeds. Unlike other films of violent events in Africa which play up the violence for \"entertainment\", this film turns the volume down, allowing for a more impactful viewing experience. Brutal images are not needed to confirm this.The theme of genocide raises questions we can ask ourselves after the film. Exactly what makes people hate each other? After the Holocaust, many thought we would never see a similar incident again. Pol Pot in Cambodia and the violence in Yugoslavia have occurred within the same generation,confriming that the human race has not learned frm past mistakes. The incident in this film occurred two decades ago. Hopefully this film along with other films (Schindler's List) allows us to see the horrors of genocide caused by hatred perpetuated by manufactured differences. Most importantly, the film encourages one to read and learn, so we as human beings do not repeat the horrors of the past. -0.07552483358934972\n",
      "The film Rwanda Hotel tells about the conflict between two races, Tutsi and Hutu. They have lived on the same land for many years. But later, in Hutu's view, the Tutsis were invaders of Belgian colonists. They plundered Hutu's land and flogged them. They called Tutsis \"cockroaches\" and \"murderers\". So they plan to drive Tutsis away and decide to \"eliminate cockroaches\". In this way, under the vigorous propaganda of Hutu Power Radio, a vicious massacre began.\n",
      "After the signal of \"Cut down the tall trees!\" the Rwandan militias killed, set fire, smashed houses, etc., and drove the Tutsis to their death. Even the orphans in the orphanage did not let go, many people died. Rwanda has always been in a state of turmoil, which has attracted the attention of the United Nations. Therefore, it has long dispatched troops to mediate in order to maintain peace. However, when the massacre began, foreign troops stationed in Rwanda were withdrawn, and the only hope of the Tutsis was dashed. With Paul's strength, he offered bribes to officers many times. Finally, hundreds of Rwandan Hotel Reed were sent to safety, so they held their lives. Eventually, the massacre was stopped, the Tutsis were rescued, all reactionary activities stopped and peace replaced everything.\n",
      "This is a war between nations. For a long time, the state has not handled the relationship between the two nationalities properly, has not implemented a reasonable national policy, and has not formulated a complete constitution of the national army, so the massacre occurred. In my opinion, there is no fundamental difference between Hutu and Tutsi. There is no cultural difference, no difference in customs, no need to be racial. Before the incident, Hutu and Tutsi were neighbors, colleagues, friends and lovers. There is no racial discrimination, not to mention the constraints of inter-ethnic interaction. However, after the Hutu incident, they lost their humanity, abandoned friendship, love and family, and carried out massacres irrationally.\n",
      "Hutu people have always regarded Westerners as intruders, with the majority dominating, and the Tutsis have become ethnic minorities. Within a country, there must be different nationalities, just as there are different people in society. Such a country is a complete country. With the exchange of different nationalities, the culture can be integrated, and the country can have a long history. It is incorrect for Hutu people to expel and kill the Tutsis in order to remove their hatred. War is not the best way to solve all problems. War only brings pain to people. Peace will win war in the end. Hutu people should remember history, but they should strive for peace instead of rewriting it. In response to the massacre, the national government did not intervene in a timely manner and did not formulate a clear system for the management of the army. The national government can carry out regional national autonomy on issues between the two ethnic groups, and each ethnic group can elect its own leaders, which will eventually be under the unified management of the state. A complete set of ethnic policies has been formulated and strictly implemented after reaching consensus on the unity of all ethnic groups. It is essential to arouse people's patriotic and peaceful consciousness, strengthen national patriotic education, deepen cultural exchanges between the two nationalities, and make them live in harmony and peaceful coexistence. 0.1274843024843025\n",
      "I think this movie did a really good job at showing the stakes that the people in this live have to go to, and getting you attached to the main family and guy, because they are genuinely good people just trying to help out one another. I think they did a good job of showing the hopelessness that this situation must feel like, and how people working together can change something even if it's small, and it will go a long way. I liked this movie for it's characters and I thought the acting was pretty well done too. Overall, it's a pretty good movie that is about something you don't usually see, but it's good that it's been shown in a movie format for people to learn at least a little bit factually (though movies aren't always factual) about events around the world. 0.2273841354723708\n",

      "I first watched this film only recently and after it was finished my overall feeling was of depression. Before I go any further I should say that it was a very disturbing and moving experience and I am glad that I spent the time to watch it properly. The film is very well made and the storyline is strong and ultimately as in most of this type of film the end result is whatever you make of it. This description sounds extremely vague but in my opinion the positive way of looking at it is that at least someone stood up to be counted and actually tried to save some of the people. If you look at it in a negative way only a small percentage of people were saved and perhaps it could be seen to be a futile attempt at trying to do what you can when virtually nobody is willing to help for numerous reasons. The way I sum it up is that one person saving one other person is an achievement and if everybody who was able tried this who knows how many more could have been saved. Anyway this film portrays people in the very worst of circumstances and this lofty ideal has its merits but when you are in a position of death being just a heartbeat away it doesn't really figure too highly in the minds of everybody under this sort of pressure. This film has been compared to Schindlers list and when you have watched it you will probably see why. This film represents an example of what happens when a group of people try to impose their will on another group of people. In my opinion unfortunately this situation will keep happening somewhere else because the United Nations and other organisations cannot act soon enough and when they do their frame of reference is so limited any peace keeping forces will not be able to interfere. At some point somebody in authority hopefully decides to do something helpful and if as in this case it is successful the world and its dog can watch in awe as someone cares enough to risk his or her life for others. Sadly it simply doesn't happen often enough and that is ultimately why this film is depressing to me. However as a shining example of a really brave person trying to do the right thing I would recommend this film to anyone. 0.06987837559266132\n",
      "I think Hotel Rwanda is better than Schindler's list.I give a 8 out of 10. Retrospecting human history,genocides seem everywhere.so we need films such as Hotel Rwanda to remind us the horror ,we must avoid the massacre,but sadly it happens again and again.Seeing this movie,I thought a lot about the massacre happened here in China during the World War 2nd,the Japanese army killed about more 300,000 Chinese people,but we haven't made a single big movie to reveal that history.there are lots of movies talking about the killing Jews,and there is a Hotel Rwanda telling the world what happened in Rwanda,but why don't we Chinese make a movie showing the world what the Japanese done to us back in the 1930s in Nanjing? About Jean Reno in the movie ,he seems a bit rigid in acting,I think he should be more passionate .The art direction is good.Terry did a great job.The screenplay is good too.the music is OK,Jean Wycle sung the song well. anyways,I am going to show my family this movie. 0.1281512605042017\n",

I had to ask how people could be so vicious. Hotel Rwanda was a truly moving film and I highly recommend it. Some of the scenes that were most moving were not even the ones that were graphic in nature. One of the most moving lines came from the Red Cross worker who was only a minor character. I didn't particularly want to the see this film but I am glad that I did. This was a story that needed to be told.

      "I saw this one yesterday, after a long day of work at the local theatre. I expected a lot of this one, and what I saw was even better. From the beginning until the end I was emotionally involved in the movie, and it never bored me a moment. --SPOILERS-- In the middle of the movie, when people arrive at the hotel, children being carried in helping hands, buses arriving, this moment -when you hear the African children chant- is one of the most gripping scenes ever captured on film, I almost cried how emotional this scene was, and it repeats itself when all the white people are being evacuated and the blacks look at the buses, completely helpless, being abandoned by the rest of the world. What a great piece of cinema! This will stick in my mind forever. The only thing that makes this not a top 20 IMDb is that I was waiting for such a moment to finish the movie, which stood out. The movie ended a bit to early for me. I missed something at the end, a feeling that leaves you in awe when the movie ends, I didn't felt the emotional impact the movie gave me in the middle of it. Rusesabagina will always be remembered as a great man, who saved the lives of hundreds, but still, the movie hasn't pushed hard enough on that emotion of being the 'hero' he really was during his life at the end. Maybe it's just me, but that's how I left the movie. Nonetheless the best drama I have seen since Mystic River. It could have been one of the greatest movies ever if George had worked out a more emotional impact in the end, but like I said, maybe that's just me. 9.5/10 great movie! Watch it! 0.22527777777777783\n",
      "The film Hotel Rwanda, Paul Rusesabagina who oversaw the Hotel des Mille Collines in Rwanda and lived with his wife Tatiana Rusesabagina, and they had three children who were all Tutsi. War began to kick off once Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana was assassinated which triggered the Rwanda Genocide. The Hutu politician, army officer, and military who had control over Rwanda for over 20 years began losing all that control because Hutu uprising led to assassinating all Tutsi tribes along with any Hutus traitors. Paul Rusesabagina had everything at the hotel under control until they start killing off the UN which were the peacekeepers. The united nation eventually departed and took all white Americans with them to ensure their safety. Paul Rusesabagina did everything he could to save the Tutsi citizens that came to the hotel. The word spread fast that it was Tutsi refugees living in the hotel and they continued trying to break into the hotel to kill them all one by one, especially the children because they did not want more generations. Eventually, Paul was about to saved more than 1,000 Tutsi and Hutu refugees.In Hotel Rwanda the film has various of themes but the one that mainly stood out to me the most is genocide because the Hutu began murdering numerous amounts of Tutsi. Genocide means having the intentions to massacre partial or a whole cultural group. Colonel Oliver does everything he can to come back an protect the refugees and help them get away, but one of the hotel workers Gregoire betrays the refugees and informs the Interahamwe on the radio that they were planning to escape. In the film you see glimpse of genocide occurring in one man's point of view. General Augustin Bizimungu is later accused of killing the president and starting this war. Paul went out to collect more supplies for the 1,000 plus refugees staying at the hotel because they began running low on supplies and as he returns back to the hotel, he went down a road that was full of dead bodies.There are two techniques in this film that are relevant to the theme Editing and lighting. In my opinion editing has some relation to the theme because it shows scenes in the film to create a cohesive storyline in what is happening. Editing not only shows clips of un-alive individuals, but it shows them it groups. The second technique that has relation to the theme is lighting because the lighting being displayed in the film usually dictates how the next scene will go. If it is daytime throughout the fil there is a eight out of ten chance anything serious is going to occur. However, when scenes are being presented and it is pitch black a lot of bodies began to drop left to right. \"The nature of the story and the shooting location have a significant effect on the contribution of lighting to the look of a film.\"\n",

      "This happened. To what extent this was \"Hollywoodized\" I may never know, as I have would have a very hard time looking up the full story - meaning what (if anything) was added, left out, etc. - just knowing this really happened was enough - and even going into it, knowing what I'd be watching, I had no idea how deeply I'd be affected.I was so happy they added the familial affection and points to the story about the main character's love for his wife, children, and not to mention every human being, it's gut-wrenching to identify with him - having to choose who to save and who not to.It's actually difficult to even review, remembering what I saw and that this is not just a made-up story. What I can't stop thinking of though, is the awards show I'd seen with Don Cheadle. His words had basically been \"before you saw this film, you probably didn't know it happened and couldn't do anything. Now, you have no excuse\". Some could take that as being poor timing or whatever nasty thing they'd want to say - to me, that was unforgettable.

      "Hotel Rwanda was a very inspirational movie. I knew little about the Rwandan Genocide, so this opened my eyes to the horrors did ensued during the 1990's. It was heartbreaking to see how much the UN wanted to help, but they could not do anything. Paul was an amazing character, who did everything he could to help as many people as he could. He would bribe people, risking his life in the process, and the fact that he held over 1000 refugees in his hotel was amazing. It pained me to see the army treat Paul and his people like dirt, not even attempting to help with the thousands upon thousands of Hutu murders. The armies came, but they arrived to tell the people that they could not help. Most of the Tutsis did nothing to deserve this hate, but they still received the full force of the genocide. On the other hand, some Hutus also did nothing to be involved in the genocide, but they were still blamed for the murders of the Tutsis. It was very good to see that the Hutu General was sent to a war crimes prison after the genocide, because what he did was horrible. No group of people should be mercilessly wiped out, no matter what happened in the past. 0.08649999999999998\n",

      "Cheadle is infinitely moving and Sophie Okonedo is quietly magnificent as his wife. The sensitivity of their performances is matched by the script and direction, which make their points, both personal and political, with grace, not bitterness. Like Schindler's List, this film takes us deeply into the horror of one of the 20th century's greatest tragedies by allowing us to focus on the illumination cast by one small story of grace, courage, and humanity. The film works because Cheadle, Nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation.

Myself having have lived in Kenya, east Africa for 17 years and my uncle having worked as a doctor in Rwanda during the genocide makes me proud that this film has been produced for the world to see. The Rwandan genocide was something that should never have happened and I am almost ashamed to live in a world where these things are overlooked.

      "This is the true story of a hotel manager called Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who harbours Tutsi families in a hotel from certain death (at the hand of the Hutu). Initially, Paul's focus is to save his own family. However, as he realises the extent of the massacre of the Tutsi people he tries to save as many as he can. He has the opportunity to leave with his family at the expense of the Tutsi that he is harbouring, but has the moral integrity to refuse.This film is an exploration of how one man's humanity is able to shine so bright when those who surround him have lost all sense of humanity themselves. Paul goes above and beyond what anybody could have expected of him. He uses his personal wealth, bribes people to gain favours and risks the lives of his family to do the right thing.In my opinion the themes of this film are very reminiscent of Schindler's List. They are both examples of films which show the difference that one man can make. If you sometimes despair at what a mess humanity is making of the world, I recommend that you watch this film to show that there is always hope. 0.185\n",

Also i didn't like how paul didn't want to help the people at first but then at the end of the movie he finally was A okay with helping them and wanted all the people to be safe and not be killed i honestly loved this movie and how everything was set of and everything. 0.26\n",

Don Cheadle was marvelous and thoroughly believable as a dignified man of strength that had to juggle the demands of protecting his family, his hotel, his people, and his identity. Sophie Okendo, who plays his wife, was equally superb as was Nick Nolte in a limited role as UN peacekeeper that really takes his job seriously.Second, the movie was thoroughly riveting from beginning to end and managed to maintain the suspense throughout - we never really knew how this was going to end for the Rusesabagina family and yet we really cared and hoped for the best against all odds.There was a moment in the film in which I cried but whether it was because of the horror the Tutsis experienced or because of the depravity latent in the heart of all mankind, I do not know.There are two moments which will stick with you. First, the memory of the bombastic radio speaker challenging the Hutu militias to \"cut the tall trees down\" is a haunting angry voice of intense evil.Second, the memory of the unwitting \"friend\" that spoke so callously about completely annihilating all Tutsis. When Paul indignantly retorts something like \"surely you can't think you can kill all of them,\" he replies \"Why not?

The writing is very realistic and the story is heart-wrenching.it takes place in Rowanda during the Tutsi/ Hutu civil war. the Tutsi minority are discriminated against and victimized by the Hutu. the character Cheadle plays is normal, everyday hotel manager, who is put in an interesting position where he becomes able to help the Tutsi. i don't want to give it away but this movie is great and it sends a strong, anti-genocide message.this movie was one of my favorites of 2004! 0.3840277777777778\n",

Just to be clear the film never touches on thatI can't imagine how the real Paul Rusesabagina felt when his hotel was hijacked and outrun with refugees whose houses were burnt down by the army. The scenes were very shocking with such killings and corpses lying around, even it makes you forget that this is a movie! I was very surprised and shocked that the U. N. were complete buttheads for not bring the Africans into safety at first, this happened the year I was born. Didn't they realise what filth and ignorance did they think of leaving the blacks out of it and bring the whites instead? I was honestly angry and they said no to safety in their country. Who do they think they are? The U.

I was frightened by how Hollywood may distort the story of the Rwandan genocide for commercial reasons. Well, I have to admit that I think they did a wonderful job. Don Cheadle really rises to the task, despite being American. It feels right to have concentrated on one person's remarkable story and allowing the horrifying conflict ( and the world's guilt ) to remain as a backdrop. I find this an important film in the way Shindlers List was important in telling a man's story and reminding us of the flawed humanity which caused it to happen in the first place.

So anyways.

      "***minor spoilers included***All it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to stand by and do nothing.The genocide in Rwanda is a stain on every western nation that claims to hold to ideals of justice and freedom. While U.S. diplomats debated terminology, nearly one million Africans were systematically slaughtered. A self-crippled United Nations was forced to stand by and watch as even its own forces were murdered by hate-filled thugs. Is that a slam on the United Nations? No. Any problems that the United Nations has are directly linked to those member states that compose its ranks. If the UN was ineffectual in Rwanda it is because the United States, France, Germany and other member states made it so. The Bush administration has shown that a nation can get a job done if it wants it bad enough. In 1994, in Rwanda did anyone really want to stop the killing bad enough?Why did this atrocity happen? It happened because, in the words of Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the people of Rwanda were not even n***ers. They were Africans. They were worthless. That is what western nations thought of Rwandans in 1994. I would like to say that is not the case any longer, but I cannot. Here is it in the year 2005 and U.S. diplomats are still arguing about terminology and innocent people are being slaughtered in the Darfur in the Western Sudan. See, we can talk all day about how we as a nation stand against tyranny. But apparently, with many western nations, there is fine print. We stand against tyranny, restrictions apply, not valid in all 50 states, results may vary.\"This is ethnic cleansing, this is the world's greatest humanitarian crisis, and I don't know why the world isn't doing more about it.\" BBC - http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3549325.stmColonel Oliver would have answer for that question. It appears that not much has changed in the decade that has passed since the Rwandan genocide.All right, I shall get off my soapbox now and get to the review of this movie. Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu who risked his life and that of his family to save over 1200 tutsi refugees, by sheltering them in the hotel he managed.The acting is superb and Cheadle shows just why he should be considered as one of the best actors of his generation. He plays Rusesabagina with a restrained dignity. Rusesabagina is a man who knows how to get things done. Bribes to officials are an everyday fact of life for him and he knows how to play the system to get what he needs for his hotel. When violence breaks out and the killing begins, he is forced to use his talents to not only save the life of a large group of refugees but the life of his own family eventually.Joaquin Phoenix has a small but wonderfully played part as cameraman Jack Daglish who is able to shoot footage of some of the atrocities as they happen. When Daglish is evacuated along with the other Europeans in the hotel, he speaks for western nations, saying \"I feel so ashamed.\" At least that is what the leaders of these nations should say. Nick Nolte's Colonel Oliver is a man trying against all odds to make a difference but who finds that the system knocks him down and stamps on him at every instance. Nolte plays him so that we almost start to feel the man's weariness just by looking at him.You really cannot come away from this film and not be affected. If you come away not feeling a sense of outrage, you must be a republican. Even though the atrocities that are depicted in this film do not hold a candle to what actually happened, director Terry George is able to get us to feel the outrage, as well as the helplessness and the impending doom these people must have felt as they wait to see if they will be able to escape death by machete purchased for a great deal: 10 cents each from China. It is a slow-burn.These days, the title of hero gets slung around far too often. I started this review with a paraphrased quote from Edmund Burke. Good men stood by and let this atrocity happen. In Rwanda one man, at least, did not stand by. For 1200 people the evil did not succeed. They survived because one man refused to give in to fear and hatred. One man did what was right. That man is a hero. That man is Paul Rusesabagina.  Deanna Carmichael  www.2-hours.com 0.12493894993894993\n",

It also gives a very important message in an absolutely non-rhetorical way: war is the worst the human being can do and/or have. No winners, only losers. The movie also criticizes the rich West (Europe & North America) which cares about countries which can make worse our standard of living, but does not care at all about so many other countries who suffer a very bad social, economical, political situation.

      "The Hotel Rwanda movie is based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina. This role is played by one of the famous actors, Don Cheadle. In the movie, Paul works as a hotel manager in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, a war between the Hutu and the Tutsi. Another famous actress in the movie is Sophie Okonedo, who acted as Tatiana Rusesabagina, Paul's wife. The movie focuses on Paul's amazing efforts to protect over a thousand Tutsi refugees, including his family, from being killed by the Hutus in the 1994 genocide war.The theme of courage is one of the central themes of the film. Despite the dangerous violence and danger in the movie, Paul shows remarkable bravery as he risks his own life to shelter and protect those seeking refuge who were actually the Tutsi in the hotel. Don Cheadle delivers an amazing performance in the movie by portraying Paul as very determined and caring, and he never gives up. He truly cared about people and helped them with all his heart.In Hotel Rwanda movie, we also see how scary and awful the genocide was. The movie shows how innocent people were hurt and killed by bad groups who were actually as the Hutus, who called themselves militias. But we see Paul helping everyone, even when things are really bad. He teaches us that it is very important to be brave and stand up for what is right, even when it is really hard. Paul's bravery shows us how strong people can be when they stand together against bad things.One of the most important techniques used in the film is the use of lighting to create a sense of tension and reality. The difference between the darkness in the hotel, where the refugees seek shelter, and the brightness of the outside world symbolizes a clear difference between safety and danger. This technique actually shows how dangerous things are for the Tutsi people and how much they need help from being killed by the Hutu.Another technique employed is how they keep showing how the radio spreads lies, causing the Hutu and Tutsi to fight. This reminds us how powerful and influential the news and the media can be in making the citizens believe things that are not true and making things even worse. It actually tells us we should always think carefully and not believe everything we hear around us, especially in the news or any other media.Lastly, the movie Hotel Rwanda shows how brave and courageous Paul was and how he helped everyone, especially the refugees, which really teaches us that people can be really strong, caring, and ready to sacrifice their lives even in really tough times. It really reminds us that it is important to be brave no matter how old we are and to treat others with kindness and understanding. 0.08783650793650796\n",

He learns to use his charm and wit to save over one thousand Hutus and Tsutsis who are being sentenced to slaughter as traitors or cockroaches. Paul, a Hutu, is married to a Tsutsi, and much is made in the film of how a name label is sufficient to condemn one--there is really little physical difference between the Tall Trees (Tsutsis) and the Hutus.

Watching Cheadle's performance is like watching a drowning man try to keep his head above water, and I mean that in a good way--there are situations that look absolutely hopeless for Rusesabagina, but he finds ways to keep people alive at the last second. Nick Nolte gives a good performance as the exasperated Colonel Oliver, a man that is handcuffed with what he can do, but ends up being noble to the end.

      "I first heard about the genocide in Rwanda from A Tutsi friend of mine in 1994, so I was a bit skeptical about whether Terry George would be able to accurately depict the sheer terror and sense of hopeless that was relayed to me by someone whose family was experiencing these events firsthand. I must say that not only did Terry George and Don Cheadle effectively convey to movie-goers the sheer horror of these events, but they were also able to convey the sense that regardless of what was shown on the screen things were significant more horrific and troubling. This is a magnificent film not just because it depicts the deeds of a truly honorable and heroic individual, but also because the acting is outstanding and the script helps conjure up images that allow the movie-goer to momentarily experience the feeling of desperation and hopelessness of the Tutsi refugees. 0.225\n",
      "I watched this film last night, and it was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager, as he took in Tutsi refugees during the Rwanda Crisis. The film does not use graphic violence to portray it's message, it just portrays events simply, and in a realistic manner. I did not know too much about what had happened in Rwanda in 1994, but this film made me stop and think. The scene when the van was driving over the road full of corpses was especially effective in that it brought home the reality to the viewer of what was happening. This is the only film I have ever watched that has made me cry. The acting is superb, and I am not surprised that Don Cheadle and Sophie Okenedo got Oscar nominations. They turn their parts into completely believable roles. They become the characters they are playing, and that is the mark of the best movies. 0.33111111111111113\n",
      "Seriously this movie wouldn't let you breathe for even a second, that's because you concentrate on hoping that Paul Rusesabagina and his family wouldn't get killed by the Hutu army. I have to admit, I am still shaken after watching this movie twenty minutes ago, it's such a heart stopper!I can't imagine how the real Paul Rusesabagina felt when his hotel was hijacked and outrun with refugees whose houses were burnt down by the army. The scenes were very shocking with such killings and corpses lying around, even it makes you forget that this is a movie! I was very surprised and shocked that the U.N. were complete buttheads for not bring the Africans into safety at first, this happened the year I was born. Didn't they realise what filth and ignorance did they think of leaving the blacks out of it and bring the whites instead? I was honestly angry and they said no to safety in their country. Who do they think they are? The U.N are still cowards today especially with Korea in trouble!Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo did such great African accents, you would think they are from Africa when they actually aren't! They were excellent and I applaud this film for not being so Hollywood. I applaud it for what we are facing in reality and I definitely should think it deserved the 3 Oscars! Excellent movie! 0.028148148148148137\n",
      "I had the opportunity to view this film via the Philadelphia Film Society. This film is exceptionally written, directed, and acted. Don Cheadle delivers a stellar performance as Paul, a hotel manager that risks his life to save the lives of 1,000 Rwandan refugees in 1994. This true story gives a comprehensive background to the horrific genocide that occurred in Rwanda and brings the fear and violence to a personal level. Thankfully, there is no gratuitous violence in the film. The director (who attended the screening, along with Paul) indicated that the film would be in limited release in NY and LA and other cities before Christmas. I highly recommend this film and it gave me great honor to be able to shake hands with the man who inspired the story. 0.16183982683982687\n",
      "An Amazing story of Real Genocide .....with a great interpretation of Don Cheadle.....Powerful and Touching ...... United we will be alive ...Like Don Said .....Great Movie ...Good job Don... 0.44000000000000006\n",
      "Unfortunateley I found that the people outside of the main characters were made out to be either a \"bunch of\" sheep wishing to be saved or a \"bunch of \" power hungry monsters..The film failed to show the complexities of how such a situation unfolds...In comparison to \"The Aviator\" we see a major difference where the lead character feared the masses, who played a subtle but more powerful role..They definitely weren't sheep or monsters..I would like to see films that show the complexities of the human grapevine a little more..The \"great hero\" who comes to the rescue is a worn out theme that is told by those who see themselves as saviors and the multitude as someone who \"needs\" them..Give me a break.. 0.06736111111111111\n",
      "Based on the true events of the massacre that took place in Rwanda during its civil war, Hotel Rwanda is a tale of how a simple man went too far & risked his own life to save as many people as he possibly could even when he had the chance to simply walk away unharmed. It's a disturbing, violent film that also shows how the entire world deserted this nation when it needed them most. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who housed thousands of people in his hotel & his performance was, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the strongest of the decade and he single-handedly carried this film throughout its runtime and was brilliantly aided by other supporting actors. On an overall scale, Hotel Rwanda is a sad, disturbing, heartfelt tale of loss & genocide but also a very important film. Like Schindler's List, it shows that nothing is more valuable than a human life and just like Oskar Schindler, it shows a compassionate human being who stood up against all odds to save a race from complete annihilation. Highly Recommended. 0.085625\n",
      "WoW-This movie is great. Compared to the movie Blood Diomonds, this movie doesn't contain lots of violence and shootings. This is also based on a true story. From this movie, I learned how important it is to do the right thing. The main character, Paul, hides about 1300 africans from a certain tribe from the other tribe that want them dead. He sacrifices everything he has to keep these people alive and his family safe with him. Thesse types of movies really make you understand better about the wars, conflicts, etc., going on in Africa. It makes you want to know more about it. Don Cheldle, who plays Paul, did such a great job acting out the part. IN the end credits, it says that, today, the real Paul- Paul R. lives in Belgium with his wife Tatiana- their 2 or 3 biological children and Tatiana's 2 adopted neices. 0.2759803921568627\n",
      "I have not seen this movie. From the comments I did read I feel Hollywood has once again taken facts and Hollywood-ized them. The main character had only a minimal role and pretty much didn't have a choice to help out. To make a factual assessment of the Genocide in Rwanda you should read the book \"Shake Hands with the Devil\" by Romeo Dallaire. He was the General in charge of the UN forces there at the time. It outlines the complete futility of the mission, the inept UN Organization in New York, the lack of cooperation and lies from the waring parties. Most importantly the way the world turned it's back on Rwanda, specifically the United States. These brave Countries had assessed there was no \"value\" or \"gain\" in helping Rwanda. Read the book. 0.20858585858585857\n",
      "First I would like to say, \"I give this movie two thumbs wayyyyy down.\" Boyz 'n' the hood and Menace to Society have nothing on this movie. Why you might ask, because once again you have non-white people killing each other and on top of that, by the thousands.It's upsetting to see non-white people slinging it out with each other and people who have the power to stop it before it start, do nothing about. Think about it, would it be a movie coined as \"Hotel Rwanda\" if the people who stopped the massacre, stopped it before it happened? This movie, at most, sends out another image of non-white people killing each other. Therefore should be condoned as good or worthy of any Grammy. 0.19475308641975306\n",
      "The first time I've seen the film I've been really taken aback. How could we had allowed occurrences of this kind to take place ?!? For this message and the film realization I put 10.On the other hand I've been about to demonize the Hutus. But after reading about the backgrounds of the conflict, un upset has arisen: why did the film makers haven't even tried, even with a few sentences of the main character to describe the origin of the conflict? Moreover there had been genocide on Hutus in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda before. This is really an angled point of view, bringing up a political film partially displaying a situation, out of context. For this I put 5.Again the humanitarian message, thanks God and probably the filmmakers, prevails. 0.13416666666666666\n",
      "I was first asked to see Hotel Rwanda for school as an extra credit assignment. I am so thankful that I did indeed see it because I never have felt the feeling that I had after this extremely moving movie. Never in my life have I felt so ashamed of the rest of the world for not stepping up, never have I felt so guilty for not being aware. I can not begin to imagine the pain these innocent people went through.It is most likely that today is a birthday of quite a few people murdered. Think of all the potential that was so cruelly thrown away...This movie is so valuable and important. I now wonder why I sigh at doing a simple task like washing dishes!?! This movie, as corny as this my sound, truly affected me... now, that's a movie everyone ought to see.God bless the those and the families of those who died for those 21 years. Allow them to rest in peace and please give the strength to those who need it most. 0.065\n"
