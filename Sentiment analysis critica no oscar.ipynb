      "Although the first half feels a little devoid of direction, Eastwood takes out the jump leads and kicks it into life, giving the second half of the film a better pace, vibrancy and gentle humour that makes Gran Torino worth at least one ride. 0.032916666666666664\n",

      "Directed by as well as starring Eastwood, this is the expected well-tooled, well-produced machine, effortlessly bringing into play big themes of age, race, religion, death, war, vengeance and cultural identity with humour, tension and pathos. 0.0\n",

      "He never manages, though, to penetrate to his character's much-touted depths, and it's left to young non-professionals Vang and Her to infuse the action with a spry, casual liveliness that offsets the film's rickety set-up and pacing. -0.07500000000000002\n",

      "Gran Torino is made without fuss and acted out with the kind of natural grace only a real titan of the cinema could manage. And Clint is a titan - one of the best directors in America and a performer whose range has extended mightily throughout his career 0.3833333333333333\n",

      "Gran Torino has much to recommend it, not least of which is Eastwood's enjoyable and slyly self-deprecating performance. And the supporting cast holds their own every step of the way. 0.34\n",
      "If you can survive the F-bombs and the near-constant ethnic invective, Gran Torino is not to be missed, if only as the gutsy, thoroughly unexpected valedictory of an icon fully willing to spend every bit of his considerable capital. 0.11249999999999999\n",
      "With Gran Torino, Eastwood has taken what might have been the likable last gasp of his iconic persona and turned it into the dullest, most heavy-handed sermon of his career. 0.255\n",

      "A thoughtful work that continues the actor/director's remarkable late-career surge. 0.575\n",
      "Eastwood's foursquare directorial aesthetic tends to heighten, rather than camouflage, a screenplay's shortcomings. He may well win the gold for this one. But we'll have to assume he's winning it for richer assignments en route. 0.65\n",
      "Gran Torino is about two things, I believe. It's about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. And it's about Americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century. 0.22727272727272724\n",
      "This is the better by far of the two movies Eastwood has made this year, a stripped-down alternative to the overupholstered Changeling. 0.3\n",

      "Gran Torino is defiantly old-fashioned, and occasionally, albeit endearingly, self-indulgent. Most of all it's heartfelt, and for me the feeling was mutual. 0.25\n",
      "A very funny and touching movie that delivers its message of tolerance with a most agreeable light hand. 0.43125\n",
      "In front of the camera, the 78-year-old actor still appears able to demolish anyone who messes with him, which is why this showcase works as well as it does. 0.5\n",
      "Its preoccupation with the burden and self-destructive ramifications of violence is given acute resonance by Eastwood's presence. 0.6\n",
      "These spectral figures, totems of masculinity and mementos from a heroic cinematic age, are what make this unassuming film small in scale if not in the scope of its ideas -- more than just a vendetta flick. 0.2375\n",
      "Gran Torino, whatever its flaws are, is a movie about what America looks like now, and it posits that the work of living amicably together is sometimes hard but always worth it. 0.004166666666666652\n",
      "Eastwood directs with his usual relaxed pace and bursts of intensity, a style that's pleasing to watch -- and which, also as usual, never fully compensates for any shortcomings of the script handed to him. -0.25\n",
      "The first two-thirds play as comedy: Eastwood grumbles, curses, and insists on being a right bastard. This is Dirty Harry gone geriatric, Eastwood parodying himself. -0.021428571428571425\n",
      "Part modern-day Western, part vigilante flick, part after-school special, Clint Eastwood's oddball drama Grand Torino remains entertaining right up to the end credits, during which you can scratch your head and wonder what you've just seen. 0.32857142857142857\n",
      "Still, as movies about crusty old men whose hearts melt through their friendship with young people go, Gran Torino is mostly a hoot, thanks to Eastwood's Archie-Bunker-with-a-gun performance. 0.22499999999999998\n",
      "A lifetime in movies runs through this prime vintage Eastwood performance. You can't take your eyes off him. The no-frills, no-bull Gran Torino made my day. 0.0\n",
      "The problem, a somewhat depressing one, is that Eastwood has grown into a director who thinks he's superior to his mentors. A hint of pretension has crept into his filmmaking, and his exchanges with his young cast feel overwrought. 0.06666666666666667\n",
      "Gran Torino becomes more intriguing as the journey its takes us on evolves and grows darker, albeit with Eastwood's trademark, no-nonsense aesthetic. 0.4\n",
      "A movie at once understated and radical, deceptively unremarkable in presentation and ballsy in its earnestness. Don't let the star's overly familiar squint fool you: This is subtle, perceptive stuff. 0.020833333333333343\n",
      "Caps [Eastwood's] career as both a director and an actor with his portrayal of a heroically redeemed bigot of such humanity and luminosity as to exhaust my supply of superlatives. 0.0\n",
      "Gran Torino being a Clint showcase helmed by the Last Movie Star himself, Walt's reformation is nearly inevitable, but skirts being cloying on the strength of the 78-year-old icon's raspy brusqueness. 0.0\n",
      "An unstable affair given to overemphasized points and telegraphed punches. 0.0\n",
      "The actor-director's second release of the season is his most stripped-down, unadorned picture in many a year. 0.3333333333333333\n",
      "Wonder is a sentimental family film. While it's not devoid of clichés, these are offset by solid performances and a winsome, uplifting story told with tenderness. -0.06666666666666667\n",
      "Wonder is a well-crafted, well-intentioned movie. But it also downplays some important economic, emotional, medical, and psychological realities...it missed a chance to better represent the experiences of children who are already so widely misunderstood. 0.11875000000000001\n",
      "It sometimes over-plays its hand but, anchored by a terrific Jacob Tremblay, Wonder is a warm persuasive argument for tolerance. 0.3\n",
      "It's a little mawkish, but Chbosky, a YA institution himself, has a gift for understanding young people and the nuances of their relationships. -0.04375\n",
      "If in the end the film feels a little too tidy, a little too contrived in the way the plot elements are neatly sewn together, this is perhaps a small price to pay for a film with its heart firmly in the right place. -0.06275510204081634\n",
      "Nonetheless, Hollywood rules in the end and it's very much a soft-focus view of a family under stress. 0.26\n",

      "[Julia Roberts] lifts every one of her scenes in Wonder to near-sublime places. 0.0\n",

      "Maybe this little movie about a kid with a facial disorder isn't really about a kid with a facial disorder at all, but about whatever you and I choose to see in it. And if that's not art, I don't know what is. 0.0031250000000000028\n",

      "The slogan \"choose kind\" is not just a tagline; it's a byword for our times and I wish more movies would preach that message. Wonderis a beautiful movie. 0.65\n",

      "Erin is far and away her own worst enemy — and a good thing too, because she needed at least one. 0.019999999999999983\n",
      "The film lacks focus and energy, the character development is facile and thin, and what about those necklines? -0.4\n",
      "Roberts shines. 0.0\n",
      "An exhilarating tale. 0.7\n",
      "One of the gutsiest, most exciting, and most satisfying courtroom docudramas ever, one that genuinely lifts the spirits as you watch it. 0.44000000000000006\n",
      "Atop all the talk about this being Roberts' career performance so far (and it is), it would be unjust to overlook that this is also the best screen role Finney has had in years. 0.55\n",
      "It's easy to forget you're watching a performance. 0.43333333333333335\n",

      "Demonstrates how good Soderbergh is with actors. 0.7\n",
      "With this script, Grant becomes Hollywood's foremost writer of strong, smart women's roles, and Lachmann works the same wonders with the atomizing light of Southern California that he did in Soderbergh's The Limey. 0.2095238095238095\n",
      "Soderbergh demands a lot from his star here, and she delivers, perhaps more than even he expected. 0.2\n",

      "It's a victory for Julia Roberts, co-star Albert Finney and director Steven Soderbergh. It's also a victory for the audience. 0.0\n",
      "Roberts does what the best movie stars do. She makes you believe in Erin Brockovich as a living, breathing human being even as you're also constantly aware that you're watching Julia Roberts on screen. 0.4166666666666667\n",

      "There's a tidiness and sense of convenience in the film's stock characterisations and button-pushing plotting that detracts from its impact. The film doesn't just contrive to contain the slaughter, but also its own anger. -0.04999999999999999\n",
      "Who cares about overdone orchestral blasts or signpost-waving lines of dialogue when such raw, naked, painful humanity is displayed by Don Cheadle in the central role? -0.18615384615384617\n",
      "Cheadle has an Oscar nomination for best actor. But this isn't a grandstanding portrayal: it is a performance at the service of the work. 1.0\n",

      "Incapable of honestly confronting its ugly subject matter. -0.08888888888888886\n",
      "Here, now, is the true face of human barbarity, and the true face of human heroism. Not in the now-distant mythology of World War II… 0.175\n",
      "The emotion comes from Don Cheadle's thrilling portrait of ordinary heroism, a performance that's matched only by the magnificent Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana. 0.25\n",
      "Scrappy, powerful, and shocking. -0.35\n",
      "Move past the big picture, of race hatred, arbitrary maps and guilt over what the UN and the West can't or won't do, and find the human story within the inhumanity of war. -0.0875\n",
      "The great strength of Hotel Rwanda is that it's not about superhuman heroism but simply about human decency. 0.26666666666666666\n",
      "The almost forgotten but all too real African genocide documented in Hotel Rwanda hits us as suddenly and as hard as it does Paul Rusesabagina, the accidental hero played so masterfully by Don Cheadle. 0.17708333333333331\n",
      "It has a genuine power: the ability of film to beam light onto dark days of history, making it impossible for us to look away, reminding us of what we should never forget. -0.004166666666666652\n",
      "What makes the film not just harrowing but transcendent is Cheadle. He does nothing traditionally heroic. He just presents a picture of basic decency, showing how, when combined with courage, decency can result in an awe- inspiring moral steadfastness. 0.3\n",
      "A film that uses the comfort of the predictable to make horror palatable to a wider audience. -0.2\n",
      "Because of the subject matter, this feels like one of those films you see because it's good for you. But it also is an extraordinarily moving drama. 0.2888888888888889\n",
      "There is much to respect in Hotel Rwanda, not least Cheadle's subtly crafted performance, which allows the audience a direct connection to his ethical growth. 0.06333333333333332\n",
      "If Hotel Rwanda does nothing more than provoke the obvious questions of 'How did this happen?' and 'How can we prevent it from happening again?' it has, like the hotelier who refuses to consider himself a hero, done its job. 0.25\n",
      "The film serves as reminder and educator for those who've forgotten or never knew about the situation in Rwanda. 0.0\n",
      "The world stayed out of Rwanda for fear of doing an imperfect job. Bold filmmakers are at their best when they mature beyond that kind of paralysis. 0.5083333333333333\n",
      "Cheadle gives one of the best performances (if not the best) of last year -- an Oscar-worthy portrait of a man who kept his head clear and his humanity intact in the midst of a man-made hell. 0.525\n",
      "The twofold agenda in Hotel Rwanda is to commemorate what Paul Rusesabagina did and to shame each and every Westerner who sees the movie. On both of those counts it is successful. 0.75\n",
      "[The movie] sweeps over you with blunt, unequivocal conviction. 0.0\n",
      "[A] flat, cramped staging which, combined with d.p. Robert Fraisse's harsh overlighting, gives the film the feel of a cheap backlot production, even though it was shot on location. 0.05833333333333334\n",
      "If [Schindler's List] had never been made, Hotel Rwanda might seem better than it does, and probably better than it is. 0.5\n",
      "A gut-punch of a drama. 0.0\n",
      "A must-see for teens (and adults, for that matter) who know the Rwanda massacre as but a distant headline. -0.1\n",
      "A horrifying yet compelling story of man's inhumanity to man. -0.30000000000000004\n",
      "It's simultaneously haunting and inspiring. 0.5\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda is a strange history lesson that leaves us more overlectured than properly overwhelmed. 0.15\n",
      "The film defines how, using cunning and courage, a person can change the course of history -- and stand up to the inhumanity in our midst. 0.0\n",
      "By turns harrowing and stirring, it's a shame-inducing history lesson that never feels like a lecture. 0.0\n",
      "Don Cheadle takes his rightful place among America's greatest actors in Hotel Rwanda. 1.0\n",
      "It's a great story. But it's Cheadle who makes the movie really special, delivering a memorable and utterly convincing portrayal of a truly good man. 0.5714285714285715\n",
      "The most truly inspiring movie of the year. 0.5\n",
      "One of the year's most moving and powerful films, anchored by a magnificent performance by Don Cheadle. 0.6\n",
      "Cheadle affects a flawless Rwandan accent and gives a performance that should shame every UN member who voted to ignore the Rwandan Tutsis' pleas. 1.0\n",
      "The film works not because the screen is filled with meaningless special effects, formless action and vast digital armies, but because Cheadle, Nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation. -0.007440476190476178\n",
      "Hotel Rwanda is a political thriller based on fact that hammers every button on the emotional console. 0.0\n",
      "Cheadle, whose Rusesabagina is both heroic and psychologically complex, is never less than utterly believable. 0.24583333333333332\n",
      "It's a gut-twisting story handled, largely and predictably, with asbestos mitts. 0.007142857142857131\n",
      "Perhaps the best movie of the year, worthy of multiple Academy Award nominations. 0.4444444444444444\n",
      "Despite flaws in execution, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart. 0.3\n",
      "I can hardly think of another movie in which sheer intelligence and decency have been made to seem so attractive or effective. 0.27708333333333335\n",
      "Terry George's Hotel Rwanda takes a cue less from history than it does from Schindler's List. -0.16666666666666666\n",
      "Both tough and tender, the movingly rendered production often strikes a devastating chord without resorting to any of the manipulative string-pulling known to accompany movies about 'men who made a difference.' -0.6944444444444444\n"
